Whatever we think about the war, whatever we call it -- Afghanistan or Iraq -- we owe our military men and women unconditional support.\"\n There was one problem: Mr. Blumenthal, a Democrat now running for the United States Senate, never served in Vietnam. He obtained at least five military deferments from 1965 to 1970 and took repeated steps that enabled him to avoid going to war, according to records.\"\n Blumenthal says he's always tried to make it clear his Marine Reserve service never took him overseas. But, the Times reported, \"an examination of his remarks at the ceremonies shows that he does not volunteer that his service never took him overseas. And he describes the hostile reaction directed at veterans coming back from Vietnam, intimating that he was among them.\"\n Blumenthal told the Times he had misspoken at the 2008 event in Norfolk in which he said he served in Vietnam.\n In a televised March debate, Blumenthal stated clearly he had not served in Vietnam.\n Blumenthal's campaign said he planned an event Tuesday with veterans showing their support for him.\n Kevin Rennie, a former Republican state lawmaker, published a blog post stating that the Times piece was \"fed to the paper by the Linda McMahon [Senate] campaign.\" McMahon, the CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, is one of the Republican Senate candidates running to face Blumenthal in November.\n Rennie wrote: \"The Blumenthal Bombshell comes at the end of more than 2 months of deep, persistent research by Republican Linda McMahon's Senate campaign. It gave the explosive Norwalk video recording to The Times. This is what comes of $16 million, a crack opposition research operation and an opponent who, in the words of the president Blumenthal worked for on a draft deferment, who gave them the sword.\"\n Rennie's article was initially re-posted on Linda McMahon's website, but the story has since been removed.\n On Tuesday morning, a set of response points were circulated by Democrats close to Blumenthal's campaign:\n -Here are the facts: unlike many of his peers, Dick Blumenthal voluntarily joined the Marine Corps Reserves in 1970 and served for six months in Parris Island, SC and six years in the reserves. He received no special treatment from anyone. Today's story unfortunately distorts Dick Blumenthal's record of service by implying that he did not serve.\n -In the past twenty years, Dick has attended literally hundreds of vets events, debates, news conferences where he was clear, honest, and proud about his service in the Marine Corps Reserve. In fact, as recently as the US Senate debate on March 1, 2010, Blumenthal clearly stated \"serving in the United States military gave me a perspective as well, even in the reserves. Although I did not serve in Vietnam, I have seen first-hand the affects of military action, and no one wants it to be the first resort, nor do we want to mortgage the countries future....\"\n -Dick has been a constant champion of veterans and of the military. Today Connecticut veterans will come together to show they have his back, just like he has had theirs.\n -On a few occasions out of hundreds, Dick misspoke and he'll be the first to admit that those were mistakes. That doesn't take anything away from Dick's service or his long record of standing up for veterans - he is known throughout the state as a strong advocate for vets services and benefits.\n -His opponent's campaign admits they are the ones who cherry-picked the quotes and are behind the hit piece. It is no surprise Linda McMahon would want to smear the Attorney General, considering all of the debauchery at the WWF under her watch, including her attempt to interfere with an investigation into widespread drug abuse.\n UPDATE: Richard Blumenthal defended himself against charges that he repeatedly made misleading comments about his military service during a press conference on Tuesday afternoon.

      "text": "SOURCE: hpo\n\nTITLE: White House Asked Bill Clinton To Talk To Joe Sestak About Senate Run\n\nPUBLISHED: 2010/05/28\n\nRep. Joe Sestak (D-Penn.) was offered a prominent but uncompensated, advisory position -- in the national security/foreign policy area -- if he declined to enter the Pennsylvania Senate primary race, a source with knowledge of the exchange said during a briefing on Friday morning.\n The offer was made by White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel through a prominent intermediary -- former President Bill Clinton -- during the months of June and July of 2009. The White House initiated the conversation, which occurred over phone. It would have allowed Sestak to remain in the House of Representatives while advising the president. The source said it would not be surprising if more than one conversation took place, though there were no other intermediaries involved. Sestak ultimately rejected the overture and went on to defeat incumbent Sen. Arlen Specter (D-Penn) in the Democratic primary election earlier this month.\n \"By virtue of his career in public service, including distinguished military service, Congressman Sestak was viewed to be highly qualified to hold a range of advisory positions in which he could, while holding his House seat, have additional responsibilities of considerable potential interest to him and value to the Executive Branch,\" a memo detailing the administration's findings reads.\n The account offered by the source was the most detailed to date from primary sources as to the conversations they had with Sestak regarding his entrance into the Pennsylvania race. News of the Clinton conversation was first reported by Greg Sargent at The Plum Line. The source challenged one major aspect of the story line, insisting that the White House never offered Sestak the job of Secretary of the Navy. The offer for that position was made more than a month before -- on March 26, 2009 -- to Ray Mabus.\n Administration officials had spent time and capital recruiting Senator Arlen Specter to switch parties and run for re-election as a Democrat. Part of that arrangement entailed clearing the field for his nomination. When Sestak began making overtures that he would run, the White House looked for ways to follow through on its promise. What resulted were the informal conversation(s).\n Since then, much intrigue has surrounded what conversations actually took place. Sestak brought the issue to the surface when he alluded to a job offer early in his primary run. But he refused to provide details, such as who approached him and what position was dangled in front of him. The White House, when pressed on the matter, had been vague. Press Secretary Robert Gibbs declined repeated attempts for comment before relaying to reporters that he and White House lawyers had looked into the matter and found it legally permissible.\n Behind the scenes, White House Counsel Bob Bauer's office began investigating the matter when stories first surfaced. The investigation was internal at first with the White House reaching conclusions at least two-and-a-half months ago. As part of the process, however, Bauer also interviewed representatives for Sestak and Clinton -- in this case Sestak's brother and Doug Brand and Bruce Lindsey respectively. The congressman and the former president were not contacted for Bauer's investigation.\n The source insisted that no laws were broken in the process of offering the position, that the matter hardly rose to the level of political scandal -- suggesting that Republicans on the Hill were hoping to reap political benefits from the saga. It certainly wasn't historically unique. As the Huffington Post reported on Thursday, various political historians and ethics lawyers have approached the Sestak news with yawns, noting that quid pro quos and backroom job offers are fairly common in administrations.\n",

Reid respects that but thinks that the mosque should be built someplace else.\"\n Reid's comments added another high-profile voice to the mosque controversy. The president first stepped into the fray Friday when he appeared to endorse the Park 51 project during a Ramadan dinner at the White House. The next day, he clarified that he was merely commenting on fundamental religious freedoms -- not specifically on the \"wisdom\" of the mosque project. Then White House spokesman Bill Burton said Obama was not \"backing off\" his original remarks.\n The prolonged presidential explanation elevated the issue beyond a local dispute and hurled it into the political arena. Republicans have since both criticized his position and pressured other Democrats to take a stand on the politically sticky issue, one where charges of insensitivity have flown on both sides.\n The White House claimed Monday that politics were not at play in Obama's decision to dive into the controversy over a planned mosque near Ground Zero.\n Burton said that he \"can't speak to the politics of what the Republicans are doing,\" but the president was not looking to make political hay with his remarks, which he reportedly considered carefully before delivering them at a White House dinner on Friday night.\n \"The president didn't do this because of the politics. He spoke about it because he feels he has an obligation as the president to address this,\" Burton said.\n But the issue was quickly feeding fuel to Republicans looking to corner Democrats into taking a position on the issue -- something they were able to avoid before the president spoke up.\n Though Reid is on the record, the National Republican Senatorial Committee on Monday targeted Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., for not speaking out on the issue. Citing an article that said the normally chatty Schumer would not comment on the mosque remarks, the NRSC said Schumer should weigh in.\n \"It's a remarkable commentary on the most camera-friendly senator that he's more than happy to weigh-in on caffeinated malt beverages, but he won't take a public position on the construction of a mosque near Ground Zero,\" NRSC spokesman Brian Walsh said in a written statement.\n \"It's time for Chuck Schumer to stand up and be counted -- does he stand with President Obama in support of this mosque or does he stand with the countless 9/11 families who believe its location is inappropriate?\" Walsh asked.\n Walsh also suggested Reid would suffer politically from his allegiance to Obama on other issues, despite his stance on the mosque.\n \"While it's commendable that Senator Reid now agrees with Republican Sharron Angle that we should respect the wishes of 9/11 families, it's regrettable that he hasn't demonstrated this same independence from President Obama on the critical issues facing America during the last 19 months,\" he said.\n Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who opposes the mosque project, said Monday that the White House softened Obama's original comments because it probably heard \"pushback\" from other Democrats. He said Obama was \"clearly\" taking a side on the issue no matter what he claims.\n \"Everyone says as far as I know that the Muslim community has the right to build a mosque. The whole question is whether they should or not,\" he told Fox News. \"So for the president to raise it in the way he did on Friday was clearly giving the impression that he was endorsing it or supporting it -- or tacitly supporting it.\"\n Most Americans think the group planning the mosque and Islamic cultural center has the right to build it, according to a Fox News poll released Friday. However, the poll showed that 64 percent think it would be wrong to build it, regardless of whether the developers are within their right to do so.\n Supporters of the mosque and cultural center in lower Manhattan, including New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, say its development should stand as a testament to religious tolerance in America. They say it would be a mistake to equate Islam as a whole, and its practice in the United States, with Al Qaeda -- and remind critics that Muslims were also killed in the attacks on the World Trade Center.\n Burton said Monday that the president weighed in as part of a constitutional discussion.\n \"The president thinks that it's his obligation to speak out when ... issues of the Constitution arise. And so, in this case, he decided to state clearly how he feels about making sure that people are treated equally, that there is a fairness and that our bedrock principles are upheld,\" Burton said.\n He added the administration can't control the conversation on cable TV or in newspapers, but the White House has had a \"pretty fulsome conversation\" about it and has addressed it to a \"pretty full extent.\"\n \"I think that it's a debate that was had and we've weighed in,\" Burton said.\n",

Speaking on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., would not go that far but said Steele must apologize to the troops.\n \"Chairman Steele needs to apologize to our military, all the men and women who've been fighting in Afghanistan,\" he said. \"This is America's war. It's not Obama's war.\"\n The GOP chairman is known for off-the-cuff and occasionally troublesome comments, but the Afghanistan remarks were too much to bear for some war-supporting Republicans.\n DeMint, who said Afghanistan is a war the United States must win, said Steele needs to \"refocus\" on the November election. He called Steele's comments \"unacceptable\" and \"inaccurate.\"\n \"We need a chairman who's focused,\" DeMint said.\n Speaking on ABC's \"This Week,\" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Steele's comments were \"wildly inaccurate.\"\n The Arizona Republican said Steele needs to assess whether he can still function in his job and must make \"an appropriate decision\" about his future.\n Trying to quell the furor, Steele issued a statement saying: \"There is no question that America must win the war on terror. ... And, for the sake of the security of the free world, our country must give our troops the support necessary to win this war.\"\n He sent an e-mail to RNC members saying he hoped his statement would \"clear up any confusion\" caused by his earlier remarks.\n That didn't seem to quiet the controversy in the slightest. Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, who led the charge of conservatives calling for Steele to step down over the remark, said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that Steele still needs to go -- though he said Steele tried to convince him otherwise.\n \"I think it would be better if he went,\" he said.\n",

Chris Dodd, D-CT, finds himself on the political ropes after a newspaper exposed a past incorrect statement regarding his service in Vietnam, and Republicans smell an opening.\n Sen. John Cornyn, R-TX, who heads the GOP campaign committee, said Tuesday, \"I think it's a blockbuster revelation,\" and predicted, \"I think it's definitely going to make that race more competitive.\"\n Blumenthal's campaign disputed a report in the New York Times as an \"outrageous distortion\" of his service in the Marines - six months on Paris Island and six years in the reserves, according to his campaign. The A.G., according to the Times, said he had misspoken at a 2008 event in Norfolk in which he said he had served in Vietnam.\n At that March 2 event, which can be found here on You Tube, Blumenthal, advocating for troops returning from war, clearly says, \"We have learned something very important since the days that I served in Vietnam... whatever we think about the war, whatever we call it 'Afghanistan or Iraq, we owe our military men and women unconditional support.\"\n Cornyn's Democratic campaign counterpart, Sen. Bob Menendez, D-NJ, Tuesday offered a critical vote of confidence in the attorney general, saying his lifetime of support for veterans is what really matters.\n \"I think he's corrected the record in the past. I think his actions standing up for veterans for a long time speaks volumes,\" Menendez said, \"I'm sure he will continue to stay in the race...and we'll continue to support him.\"\n Dodd, who faced an onslaught of criticism for his involvement with now-defunct Countrywide mortgage broker, among other problems, quickly scuttled his re-election plans in order to make way for the exceedingly popular Blumenthal, when it was clear in polls that Dodd was not likely to win his race.\n Blumenthal will face the winner of the GOP primary on August 10 - either former Cong. Rob Simmons, himself a Vietnam vet, or former WWE wrestling executive Linda McMahon.\n The attorney general is scheduled to appear at a news conference later today with veterans at the Veterans of Foreign Wars post in West Hartford.\n",

The resolution initially said the NAACP would \"repudiate the racism of the Tea Parties\" and stand against the movement's attempt to \"push our country back to the pre-civil rights era,\" though the wording was amended to downplay criticism of all Tea Partiers while asking them to repudiate bigots in their own ranks.\n \"We take no issue with the Tea Party movement. We believe in freedom of assembly and people raising their voices in a democracy,\" the NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous said in a written statement announcing the unanimous vote. \"What we take issue with is the Tea Party's continued tolerance for bigotry and bigoted statements.\n \"The time has come for them to accept the responsibility that comes with influence and make clear there is no place for racism and anti-Semitism, homophobia and other forms of bigotry in their movement.\"\n NAACP leaders have referenced an incident in March when Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers on Capitol Hill ahead of a health care vote.\n But Tea Party members have challenged claims that their activists accosted black lawmakers in March and no visual evidence has been produced depicting a racist attack. Dallas Tea Party founder Phillip Dennis said \"there was no proof\" of racist behavior at the event and that the movement welcomes minority members.\n \"We don't care about the pigment of one's skin,\" he said. Dennis accused the NAACP of playing the \"race card\" and called the organization \"irrelevant.\"\n The nearby St. Louis Tea Party had an all-hands-on-deck response to the NAACP's plan. The group has drafted a resolution of its own condemning the civil rights group for reducing itself to a \"bigoted\" and \"partisan attack dog organization.\"\n Debate was mostly closed to the public, but the final version \"calls on the tea party and all people of good will to repudiate the racist element and activities within the tea party,\" said Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP's Washington bureau.\n The final wording won't be released until the NAACP's national board of directors approves the resolution during its meeting in October. But the original called for the NAACP to \"educate its membership and the community that this movement is not just about higher taxes and limited government.\" It said something could evolve \"and become more dangerous for that small percentage of people that really think our country has been taken away from them.\"\n In a matter of hours, the St. Louis group fired off to the NAACP the statement demanding the organization withdraw its \"bigoted, false and inflammatory\" resolution. The missive accused the NAACP of resorting to political tactics and urged the IRS to reconsider whether it can continue to qualify for tax-exempt status.\n Tea Party organizers routinely defend themselves against charges of racism, disavowing racially charged signs that appear in their protest crowds and provide fodder for Tea Party critics. The NAACP resolution, first reported by the Kansas City Star, was expected to make reference to the March incident on Capitol Hill.\n St. Louis Tea Party organizer Bill Hennessy wrote on the group's website Tuesday that the Tea Party stands for smaller government and fiscal responsibility, and accused the NAACP of abandoning black America.\n \"When you look at the crime and poverty and family breakdown of the African-American community ... you see a half-century of failure by the NAACP,\" he wrote. \"None of those persistent problems was caused by the Tea Party movement, yet the principles of the Tea Party are exactly what's needed to wind down the multigenerational destruction in the African-American community.\n \"The NAACP was once a vital weapon in the war against segregation and oppression. All that's left is a bigoted and malicious shell that does far more harm than good for people who need a break,\" he wrote.\n Fellow St. Louis Tea Party organizer Dana Loesch accused the NAACP of morphing into a political organization.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They no longer prioritize civil rights,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she told Fox News.\n",

No matter how intrusive and partisan our politics can become, this does not justify a poor response.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He added, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have and I will always work to promote a civil public discourse.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n A young man, dressed in a jacket and tie, approached the congressman on a sidewalk, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hi, Congressman. How are you? Do you fully support the Obama agenda?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Etheridge, a seven-term House member, can be seen on the video repeatedly asking the young man to identify himself.

A second person accompanying him pulled out another camera to record the congressman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions.  The video received widespread attention on Monday after it was posted on the Web site of Andrew Breitbart, a conservative Web publisher and former editor of The Drudge Report.

He won two years ago by 36 percentage points, and Mr. Obama carried his district by 6 percent.\n Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. resumed the White House campaign for gun control on Tuesday by reporting on executive action taken unilaterally by the administration and pressing Congress to take up legislation again.\n",

Bush in response to the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Obama shifted the focus on the war on terrorism from Iraq to Afghanistan and last year announced his plan to send 30,000 more troops there.\n Mr. Steele\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments prompted William Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard and a leading voice of conservative support for the war in Afghanistan, to call for Mr. Steele\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation as party leader.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Your tenure has, of course, been marked by gaffes and embarrassments, but I for one have never paid much attention to them, and have never thought they would matter much to the success of the causes and principles we share,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Kristol wrote Friday. He added, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Needless to say, the war in Afghanistan was not \u00e2\u20ac\u02dca war of Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s choosing.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 It has been prosecuted by the United States under Presidents Bush and Obama.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He added, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are, of course, those who think we should pull out of Afghanistan, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re certainly entitled to make their case. But one of them shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the chairman of the Republican Party.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n A spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, Brad Woodhouse, said Mr. Steele was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153betting against our troops and rooting for failure in Afghanistan.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Republican officials dismissed that criticism.\n When Mr. Steele made the remarks, he was speaking to Republican contributors at a fund-raiser in Connecticut. Linda McMahon, the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s candidate for the United States Senate in Connecticut, was in the audience, along with other leading state Republicans. The video appears to have been taken by a hidden camera at an event that was closed to the press. Republican officials did not dispute the authenticity of the video, but disputed its characterization.\n In his statement on Friday afternoon, Mr. Steele did not respond to the call for his resignation. But he sought to make the case that Afghanistan is now Mr. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s war.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the sake of the security of the free world, our country must give our troops the support necessary to win this war,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Steele said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As we have learned throughout history, winning a war in Afghanistan is a difficult task. We must also remember that after the tragedy of Sept. 11, 2001, it is also a necessary one.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He added, with a reference to Gen. David H. Petraeus: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That is why I supported the decision to increase our troop force and, like the entire United States Senate, I support General Petraeus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation. The stakes are too high for us to accept anything but success in Afghanistan.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Seizes on Mosque Issue Ahead of Elections\n\nPUBLISHED: 2010/08/14\n\nWASHINGTON \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Republican Congressional candidates on Monday intensified efforts to inject the divide over construction of an Islamic center near ground zero into the midterm campaigns while the Senate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top Democrat said he objected to the mosque being built there.\n Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader and a Democrat facing a difficult re-election fight, said through a spokesman that those who plan to erect the Islamic center should look elsewhere. That separates Mr. Reid from President Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support of the developers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 right to build the center.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The First Amendment protects freedom of religion,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Jim Manley, a top adviser to Mr. Reid. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Senator Reid respects that but thinks that the mosque should be built someplace else.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In a number of releases and statements, Republican House and Senate candidates challenged Democrats like Mr. Reid to make their positions clear on the construction of a mosque and community center about two blocks from the site of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in New York City.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ground zero is hallowed ground to Americans,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Elliott Maynard, a Republican trying to unseat Representative Nick J. Rahall II, a Democrat, in West Virginia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Third District, said in a typical statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do you think the Muslims would allow a Jewish temple or Christian church to be built in Mecca?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Republicans said Mr. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defense of the right of the developers to pursue the project showed that he was out of touch with average Americans.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is very troubling to see President Obama again turning a deaf ear to the thoughts and concerns of a majority of Americans,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said James Renacci, a Republican candidate in Ohio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 16th District, who said people at a recent public meeting were furious about the mosque proposal.\n The remarks were a rare instance in this campaign season when Republicans have strayed from a focus on economic issues in their push for substantial gains in the House and Senate in November. The intensity of their attacks showed that they do not appear worried about the risk of being seen as intolerant or not supportive of the right to freedom of religion.\n Some leading Democrats said it was the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role to stand up for constitutional rights in the mosque dispute.\n Representative James E. Clyburn, the No. 3 House Democrat, said Monday that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153articulating the constitutional principles\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d on which the country was founded and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153calling for tolerance on the part of all of its people\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d were part of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a presidential act worth exercising.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Privately, many Democrats were not pleased that the issue had been thrown into their laps during the summer recess as they believed they had been making inroads by talking about how some Republicans support privatizing Social Security. But strategists said Democrats could counter the Republican offensive by labeling the mosque dispute as a local issue and saying Democrats remain focused on the economy.\n Some also said the White House should not have put lawmakers on the spot in the first place and could have been better prepared for the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement, lining up religious and community leaders to offer support for the right to build the mosque and undermine Republican attacks.\n Other Democrats said they did not see the fight resonating strongly outside New York and did not expect it to become a defining campaign issue.\n Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat who represents the district that includes ground zero, said he doubted that the fight over the mosque would inflict much damage on fellow Democrats in the November elections.\n Mr. Nadler, whose view is that the developers were entitled to build the mosque at the selected location if they choose, said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ultimately I suspect that once this simmers down in a few weeks, people will realize that everybody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liberty is at stake here.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The planned community center, perhaps 15 stories tall, would be built in three adjacent buildings two blocks north of ground zero, though one building, owned by Consolidated Edison, has yet to be sold. The other two are all but vacant now; worship services are already taking place in one of them.\n The developer, Sharif el-Gamal, a real estate investor born in New York, has said the center would include meeting rooms, a prayer space, a 500-seat auditorium and a pool. Two mosques, founded in 1970 and 1985, are already within several blocks of the proposed center. They are so busy and crowded that a search was begun for more space.\n Before Mr. Obama spoke out, leading Republican figures like Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House, and Sarah Palin, the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2008 vice-presidential nominee, had been voicing opposition to the Islamic center. That caused other Republicans to warn that the party risked a backlash and was alienating the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Muslims.\n But Mr. Gingrich showed no sign of backing down on Monday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nazis don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the right to put up a sign next to the Holocaust Museum in Washington,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Gingrich said on the Fox News program \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fox and Friends.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We would never accept the Japanese putting up a site next to Pearl Harbor. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no reason for us to accept a mosque next to the World Trade Center.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Democratic campaign officials accused Republicans of exploiting the Sept. 11 attacks, noting that their outrage over the Islamic center came just weeks after many House Republicans opposed a new medical program to monitor and treat emergency workers and others suffering ill effects from exposure to hazardous materials at ground zero.\n",

Joe Sestak about the possibility of obtaining a senior position in the Obama administration if he would drop out of the Democratic primary race against establishment-backed Sen. Arlen Specter, the Obama administration said in a report released Friday morning.\n But the report, by White House Counsel Robert Bauer, concluded that \"allegations of improper conduct rest on factual errors and lack a basis in the law.\"\n Batting down allegations that the White House dangled the secretary of Navy position in front of Sestak, the report said that Sestak was offered executive branch positions on advisory boards that were uncompensated.\n One of the jobs Clinton specifically discussed with Sestak was the president's intelligence advisory board. But a White House official said the plan always was for Sestak to remain in the House, and he couldn't have served in the House and on the president's intelligence advisory board.\n The report also described the Clinton conversations as informal and not tied to any precise job offer since, as a former president, Clinton could not guarantee Sestak anything.\n Clinton initiated conversations with Sestak at the behest of White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, who was Clinton's political director when he was president. As president, Clinton promoted Sestak to vice admiral and made him his director of defense policy. Sestak was also a loyal and tireless supporter of Hillary Clinton's run for the presidency in 2008.\n At hastily arranged news conference Friday afternoon, Sestak said Clinton called him last summer to express concerns over his jumping into the Senate primary, and how his military background could help him leave a mark on the House.\n Sestak said he almost interrupted Clinton to tell him Clinton that \"I am going to decide to get into this or not only depending upon what's good for Pennsylvania's working families and not an offer. And he said 'I knew you'd say that,'\" before the conversation moved on to other subjects.\n The White House report disputed any suggestion that there was \"impropriety\" in Clinton's discussion with Sestak over possible alternatives to his Senate candidacy.\n \"There have been numerous, reported instances in the past when prior administrations -- both Democratic and Republican, and motivated by the same goals -- discussed alternative paths to service for qualified individuals also considering campaigns for public office,\" the report read. \"Such discussions are fully consistent with the relevant law and ethical requirements.\"\n The report comes one day after President Obama insisted \"nothing improper\" happened with Sestak. On that same day, Obama had lunch with Clinton.\n \"This is punishable by prison. This is a felony,\" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., who has been leading the charge for more details on the allegation.\n \"This is about the White House. This is not about Congressman Sestak,\" Issa said, adding that he wants to know what Clinton was empowered to say. \"They've answered a question and it begs many more answers,\" he said. \"We want elections not to be appointments.\"\n Sestak's opponent in the general election for the Senate seat, Republican Pat Toomey, questioned why it took so long for this explanation.\n \"If this explanation is as innocent as it looks, I sure don't know why it took three months to say so,\" Toomey said in a statement. \"As I've said many times, this job offer issue is not my focus, and it's not where Pennsylvanians want the focus of the campaign to be.\"\n Critics say the Sestak job offer may have violated the part of the U.S. code that says: \"Whoever, directly or indirectly, promises any employment, position, compensation...appointment...provided for or made possible in whole or in part by any Act of Congress...to any person as consideration, favor, or reward for any political activity...or in connection with any primary election ...shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.\"\n",

Whatever we think about the war, whatever we call it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Afghanistan or Iraq \u00e2\u20ac\u201d we owe our military men and women unconditional support.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n There was one problem: Mr. Blumenthal, a Democrat now running for the United States Senate, never served in Vietnam. He obtained at least five military deferments from 1965 to 1970 and took repeated steps that enabled him to avoid going to war, according to records.\n The deferments allowed Mr. Blumenthal to complete his studies at Harvard; pursue a graduate fellowship in England; serve as a special assistant to The Washington Post\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s publisher, Katharine Graham; and ultimately take a job in the Nixon White House.\n In 1970, with his last deferment in jeopardy, he landed a coveted spot in the Marine Reserve, which virtually guaranteed that he would not be sent to Vietnam. He joined a unit in Washington that conducted drills and other exercises and focused on local projects, like fixing a campground and organizing a Toys for Tots drive.\n Many politicians have faced questions over their decisions during the Vietnam War, and Mr. Blumenthal, who is seeking the seat being vacated by Senator Christopher J. Dodd, is not alone in staying out of the war.\n But what is striking about Mr. Blumenthal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record is the contrast between the many steps he took that allowed him to avoid Vietnam, and the misleading way he often speaks about that period of his life now, especially when he is speaking at veterans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ceremonies or other patriotic events.\n Sometimes his remarks have been plainly untrue, as in his speech to the group in Norwalk. At other times, he has used more ambiguous language, but the impression left on audiences can be similar.\n In an interview on Monday, the attorney general said that he had misspoken about his service during the Norwalk event and might have misspoken on other occasions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My intention has always been to be completely clear and accurate and straightforward, out of respect to the veterans who served in Vietnam,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n But an examination of his remarks at the ceremonies shows that he does not volunteer that his service never took him overseas. And he describes the hostile reaction directed at veterans coming back from Vietnam, intimating that he was among them.\n In 2003, he addressed a rally in Bridgeport, where about 100 military families gathered to express support for American troops overseas. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When we returned, we saw nothing like this,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Blumenthal said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let us do better by this generation of men and women.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n At a 2008 ceremony in front of the Veterans War Memorial Building in Shelton, he praised the audience for paying tribute to troops fighting abroad, noting that America had not always done so.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I served during the Vietnam era,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I remember the taunts, the insults, sometimes even physical abuse.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Blumenthal, 64, is known as a brilliant lawyer who likes to argue cases in court and uses language with power and precision. He is also savvy about the news media and attentive to how he is portrayed in the press.\n But the way he speaks about his military service has led to confusion and frequent mischaracterizations of his biography in his home state newspapers. In at least eight newspaper articles published in Connecticut from 2003 to 2009, he is described as having served in Vietnam.\n The New Haven Register on July 20, 2006, described him as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a veteran of the Vietnam War,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and on April 6, 2007, said that the attorney general had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153served in the Marines in Vietnam.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d On May 26, 2009, The Connecticut Post, a Bridgeport newspaper that is the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-largest daily, described Mr. Blumenthal as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a Vietnam veteran.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d The Shelton Weekly reported on May 23, 2008, that Mr. Blumenthal \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was met with applause when he spoke about his experience as a Marine sergeant in Vietnam.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n And the idea that he served in Vietnam has become such an accepted part of his public biography that when a national outlet, Slate magazine, produced a profile of Mr. Blumenthal in 2000, it said he had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enlisted in the Marines rather than duck the Vietnam draft.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n It does not appear that Mr. Blumenthal ever sought to correct those mistakes.\n In the interview, he said he was not certain whether he had seen the stories or whether any steps had been taken to point out the inaccuracies.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if we tried to do so or not,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. He added that he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possibly know what is reported in all\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the articles that are written about him, given the large number of appearances he makes at military-style events.\n He said he had tried to stick to a consistent way of describing his military experience: that he served as a member of the United State Marine Corps Reserve during the Vietnam era.\n Asked about the Bridgeport rally, when he told the crowd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When we returned, we saw nothing like this,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Blumenthal said he did not recall the event.\n",

Jon Kyl, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, told reporters that a tax cut bill could be on the Senate floor as early as Thursday.\n But, in a surprise move, Senate Democrats, meeting behind closed doors to discuss the tax deal, have asked the administration for \"changes\" to the bill, according to Sen Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber. Durbin would not detail what those changes are, deferring to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.\n Kyl said an official analysis and price tag, referred to as a \"score,\" from the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) are not yet ready, but that the Senate could move to the bill anyway.\n Vice President Biden traveled to the Capitol Wednesday for a private meeting with House Democrats who are resisting the deal, saying it gives away too much to the wealthy.\n Some Democrats are unhappy that Obama agreed to extend expiring tax cuts not just for the middle class but also for higher earners, and that he agreed to impose a lower estate tax on wealthy heirs. Both provisions are seen by many Democrats as giveaways to the rich that will do little to help the economy.\n In return, Democrats would get extended jobless benefits for people who have been unemployed for long stretches. Workers would also see their share of Social Security payroll taxes cut by nearly a third for the coming year, a boost in take-home pay meant to encourage spending and aid the economy.\n Liberals are going as far as trying to prevent outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from bringing the tax cut compromise to the floor.\n Reps. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, and Jim McDermott and Jay Inslee of Washington state are crafting a letter to share with the House Democratic Caucus that would try to block the bill from seeing the light of day. They're hoping to get 60 signatures on their letter and then force a vote in the caucus.\n \"There does not seem to be a majority of the Democrats who support the deal negotiated by Vice President Biden,\" he told Fox News. \"So we want to have a record vote in the caucus on a resolution that says this resolution should not go to the floor without a majority of Democratic votes.\"\n DeFazio said House Democrats aren't going to keep rubber-stamping deals they don't like.\n \"All through this administration, the White House has been a spear carrier for the president,\" he said. \"They sent something over, the speaker has jammed it through and then Obama has negotiated with the Senate. And they're trying to get us to jam it through again. And a number of us are just saying that's enough.\"\n Obama rejected claims that he betrayed Democrats by cutting a deal with Republicans. Speaking to reporters at a joint appearance with Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski, Obama said economists predict higher job growth in 2011 and 2012 if Congress passes the agreement and urged lawmakers to examine the details of the deal and \"get this done.\"\n But House Democrats are not listening.\n \"So far, the response has not been very good,\" Pelosi said. She called the estate tax provision \"a bridge too far.\"\n",

A handful of well-placed and influential RNC insiders tell Fox News they expect Steele to announce he is not running for re-election.\n But Steele has been unpredictable, especially over recent weeks, and some close to the GOP chairman say he wants to run for another term and is struggling to find enough support for a second term.\n Fox News confirmed Steele sent an e-mail to committee members Saturday night with the subject line, \"conference call.\"\n In the note, he asked members to join him \"for a private conference call\" Monday evening.\n Republicans picked up 63 seats in the House, narrowed the gap in the Senate and picked up 19 state legislative bodies in the November midtem election, but pressure has been mounting all year for Steele to step down from the position.\n Critics have described the chairman as gaffe-prone and said he hasn't raised enough money. The criticism has resulted in an array of challenges or potential challenges for Steele's job from Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Reince Priebus, former RNC Co-Chairwoman Ann Wagner, longtime Republican official Maria Cino, former Michigan Republican Party Chairman Saul Anuzis and former RNC Political Director Gentry Collins.\n The fierce competition will end next month with the selection of a chairman for the 2012 election cycle.\n",

Using hand gestures, multiple impersonations and his infamous chalkboard, he took the usual swipes at Democrats. \"Progressivism,\" he declared, \"is eating the Constitution.\" Moreover, it \"was designed to eat the Constitution.\"\n But the nearly hour-long address was spent not bemoaning his ideological foes, but rather demanding purity among his likely allies. If last year's CPAC keynote speech - delivered by radio host Rush Limbaugh - was defined by urging President Barack Obama to fail, Beck's stood out for his demand that conservatism succeed.\n \"Dick Cheney a couple days ago... says it is going to be a good year for conservative ideas,\" he declared at one point, wiping the sweat from his brow. \"It is going to be a very good year. But it is not enough just to not suck as much as the other side.\"\n And who, exactly, sucked as much as the other side? Beck didn't really name names - save for a swipe at one Republican (presumably Sen. John McCain) for admiring another Republican, Teddy Roosevelt -- the latter of whom Beck accused of launching the modern progressive movement. But the message was clear: supporting anything that closely resembled the Democratic agenda would no longer fly with the modern GOP.\n \"I have not heard people in the Republican Party admit yet that they have a problem,\" he said. \"I haven't seen the Come-To-Jesus moment from Republicans yet.\"\n \"One party will tax and spend,\" he added at another point. 'One party won't tax and will spend. It is both of them together.\"\n The plea was made all the more effective by the intertwining of Beck's own story of struggle and redemption. Pointing to his time as a recovering alcoholic, the Fox News host urged the GOP to embark on a 12-step program of recovery. \"Hello, my name is the Republican Party, and I got a problem. I'm addicted to spending and big government,\" he declared, reading out the apology he wanted lawmakers to deliver. Reflecting on his own lack of formal education, he railed against government handouts - extending the logic to argue against a right to health care.\n The crowd was enthralled, even as Beck took them down winding tales of Calvin Coolidge, the Statute of Liberty and the supposed great middle class explosion of the 1920s.\n But was the message what the conservative movement needed to hear? Tradition dictates that political parties out of power do what they can to expand their coalition. Elections, after all, are won when candidates broaden their appeal to the voters responsible for electing them. For Beck and the surrounding CPAC crowd, however, ideological purity was the path to redemption and recovery.\n All we've heard, the Fox News host complained, is \"we need a big tent. We need a big tent. Can we get a bigger tent? How can we get a big tent? What is this the circus? America is not a clown show. America is not a circus. America is an idea. America is an idea that sets people free.\"\n",

Mr. Sestak said no and went on to win last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s primary against Senator Arlen Specter.\n The White House disputed Republican claims that the conversations might be illegal or improper. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was no such impropriety,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Robert F. Bauer, the White House counsel, said in a memo released to reporters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Democratic Party leadership had a legitimate interest in averting a divisive primary fight and a similarly legitimate concern about the congressman vacating his seat in the House.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Bauer went on to say that such horse-trading has been commonplace through history. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There have been numerous, reported instances in the past when prior administrations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both Democratic and Republican, and motivated by the same goals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c discussed alternative paths to service for qualified individuals also considering campaigns for public office,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he wrote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Such discussions are fully consistent with the relevant law and ethical requirements.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Representative Darrell Issa of California, the senior Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said the interactions described by the White House \u00e2\u20ac\u0153represent an illegal quid pro quo,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d even if the position was unpaid. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is abundantly clear that this kind of conduct is contrary to President Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge to change \u00e2\u20ac\u2122business as usual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and that his administration has engaged in the kind of political shenanigans he once campaigned to end.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Federal law makes it a crime for anyone \u00e2\u20ac\u0153who directly or indirectly, promises any employment, position, compensation, contract, appointment, or any other benefit\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d to someone else \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as consideration, favor, or reward for any political activity or for the support of or opposition to any candidate or any political party in connection with any general or special election to any political office.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d It is also illegal for a government official to use \u00e2\u20ac\u0153his official authority for the purpose of interfering with, or affecting, the nomination or the election of any candidate\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d for Senate.\n While many have speculated that the White House offered to appoint Mr. Sestak as secretary of the Navy, Mr. Bauer said that was never the case. The White House did not offer Mr. Sestak a full-time paid position because Mr. Emanuel wanted him to stay in the House rather than risk losing his seat, so he considered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uncompensated advisory board options.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The White House did not disclose what those options were, but people briefed on the matter said one option was an appointment to the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Intelligence Advisory Board, a panel of prominent Americans outside government who provide independent oversight of the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spy apparatus and advise the president. But White House officials discovered that it would not work because Mr. Sestak could not serve on the board while still serving in Congress.\n In a statement Friday, Mr. Sestak said Mr. Clinton had conveyed Mr. Emanuel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion that he join a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153presidential board\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d while remaining in the House, but he declined. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I told President Clinton that my only consideration in getting into the Senate race or not was whether it was the right thing to do for Pennsylvania working families and not any offer,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Sestak said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The former president said he knew I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say that, and the conversation moved on to other subjects.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Sestak first mentioned publicly in February that he had been offered a job but provided no details, and the White House for three months had refused to discuss it, generating intense criticism from Republicans who accused it of trying to bribe a congressman and deep consternation among Democrats who called on the administration to answer questions.\n Mr. Emanuel was eager last summer to clear the way to this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Democratic Senate nomination for Mr. Specter, who had just left the Republican party, and to bolster Democrats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 majority in the Senate. Mr. Sestak, a retired admiral and two-term House member, was already planning a run.\n In tapping Mr. Clinton as the go-between, Mr. Emanuel picked the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most prominent figure other than Mr. Obama and someone Mr. Sestak had worked for on the National Security Council in the 1990s. Mr. Sestak endorsed Hillary Rodham Clinton against Mr. Obama in the 2008 presidential primaries, and Mr. Clinton was one of the first to call to congratulate him on his Senate victory last week.\n Mr. Clinton was at the White House on Thursday to have lunch with Mr. Obama and join him in greeting the American men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Cup soccer team heading to South Africa.\n As chief of staff and previously as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Mr. Emanuel has not been shy about trying to steer party nominations to those he considers the stronger candidates. The White House under Mr. Emanuel has also leaned on Gov. David Paterson of New York to drop out of this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gubernatorial race, which he eventually did under a cloud of scandal. Mr. Emanuel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy, Jim Messina, suggested a possible administration job to Andrew Romanoff to get him to not challenge Sen. Michael Bennet in a Colorado primary, The Denver Post has reported, citing unnamed sources.\n Whether that constitutes ordinary political horse-trading or crosses a legal line has been debated in Washington for months. Democrats and some Republicans have said it is hardly unusual for presidents to offer political appointments to clear the way for allies. But Republicans have suggested such actions may constitute a crime.\n Mr. Issa and all seven Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee have asked the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor. The Justice Department wrote Mr. Issa last week that it did not need a special prosecutor to investigate if it chose to do so. Government officials, who asked not to be identified discussing legal decisions, said that neither the Justice Department nor the Office of Special Counsel, an agency that looks at violations of the Hatch Act governing the political conduct of federal employees, is investigating.\n While declining to discuss what happened, Mr. Obama on Thursday said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can assure the public that nothing improper took place.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

The administration has been pushing back hard against criticism from fellow Democrats that the president has caved too much to Republicans.\n In brief remarks after meeting with President Bronislaw Komorowski of Poland, Mr. Obama on Wednesday emphatically disputed that Democrats generally feel betrayed by his deal with Congressional Republicans on the tax cuts, saying that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the more who look at it, the more will say this makes sense.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I just think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very important for Congress to examine the agreement, look at the facts, have a thorough debate, but get this done. The American people are watching, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting action on our parts,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Obama said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think we need to translate that.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In a joint appearance at the White House with Mr. Komorowski, Mr. Obama said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economists across the country have upwardly revised their forecasts for growth\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d after the tax deal was announced on Monday night.\n Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. planned to return to Capitol Hill this afternoon to meet with House Democrats as President Obama and the White House sought to quell the uproar among liberals about the tax deal.\n Officials said Mr. Biden will travel to the Hill around 4:30 p.m. in an attempt to sell the compromise Mr. Obama announced this week. It will be the second time in two days that Mr. Biden has served as the liaison-in-chief for the White House.\n Mr. Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit and the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments come as the administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message machine started churning out statements of support.\n To counter condemnations from some Democrats in Congress, the White House circulated a series of e-mails quoting endorsements from private-sector economic forecasters, liberal as well as conservative analysts, and Democratic officeholders, including an obscure freshman House member, Representative Gary Peters of Michigan.\n By noon, the White House press office had released supportive comments from Antonio Villaraigosa, the mayor of Los Angeles, and Mr. Peters. The Democratic National Committee alerted reporters that Jennifer Granholm, the Democratic governor of Michigan, also supports the deal.\n John Podesta, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton and a close ally of Mr. Obama, issued a statement calling the tax deal \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a steep price\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d but saying the president was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153right to choose helping working Americans over a December conflagration.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d  The Democratic National Committee also sent that statement around to reporters.\n David Axelrod, the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief political adviser, said on CNN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153American Morning\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d that middle-class Americans were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153going to get screwed\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d if their tax cuts were not extended at the end of the year.\n The administration was quick to highlight comments from Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122sEconomy.com, projecting that the Obama tax deal would increase economic growth next year by 1.25 percentage points and create 1.6 million jobs. Macroeconomic Advisors, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs projected smaller increases but no less than at least 0.5 percentage point. That is on top of projections that currently are in the range of 2 percent to 3 percent.\n But the public relations offensive is being met with public expressions of outrage from Mr. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s base, including the most liberal members of Congress and spokesmen for interest groups on the left.\n Close to three dozen House Democrats have signed a letter from Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, calling the tax deal \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fiscally irresponsible\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grossly unfair.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d The letter says Mr. Obama \u00e2\u20ac\u0153should not back down.

Run\n\nPUBLISHED: 2010/12/12\n\nThe battle for control of the Republican National Committee will take a new turn on Monday when Michael Steele announces whether he plans to step down as party chairman or will disregard the onslaught of criticism about his oversight of the committee and seek a second term.\n Mr. Steele is expected to disclose his intentions during a conference call with committee members on Monday evening. Mr. Steele has lost the backing of many top supporters, but he has not yet said whether he will try to rebuild his frayed coalition and fight for the chance to lead the party into the 2012 election cycle.\n Mr. Steele\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenure has been one of the few blemishes this year for the Republican Party, which scored historic victories in the midterm elections. At least six top Republicans have already taken steps to run for party chairman and several members have withdrawn their support for Mr. Steele, leading many party leaders to conclude that Mr. Steele will not seek reelection.\n But Mr. Steele has kept close counsel about his future, Republican officials said Sunday, and his plans were unknown even to several of his own advisers. A spokesman for the R.N.C. did not respond to inquiries about the conference call, which Mr. Steele announced personally in a weekend e-mail message to fellow Republicans.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dear Members, Please join me for a private conference call,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Steele wrote in a message to Republicans, which was provided to the New York Times by a committee member. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Thank you and I look forward to talking to you Monday evening.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n A coordinated effort to replace Mr. Steele has been underway for weeks, with several leading Republicans arguing that the committee needed to urgently improve its fund-raising practices and tighten its organizational structure to prepare for the presidential election. The political director of the committee resigned in protest last month and is among those vying for the job.\n Mr. Steele, a former lieutenant governor of Maryland, was elected in January 2009 to lead Republicans at a bleak moment. He has argued that he deserves credit for building the party in all corners of the country and winning control of the House of Representatives last month.\n The contenders for the position include: Reince Preibus, chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party; Ann Wagner of Missouri, an ambassador to Luxembourg in the Bush administration; Maria Cino, a veteran Republican operative who has the support of former Vice President Dick Cheney; Saul Anuzis, former Republican chairman in Michigan; and Gentry Collins, who resigned last month as political director. A former party chairman, Mike Duncan, also is considering a run.\n The 168-member committee will elect a chairman during its meeting in January.\n",

At least one GOP insider who had direct contact with Steele told the Washington Post that the chairman would indeed be seeking another term atop the RNC.\n Hotline On Call says the nature of the decision is a \"closely guarded secret\" and reports that \"even his top advisors, both inside and outside the committee, say they don't know which direction he will take.\"\n Steele's gaffe-prone tenure at the helm of the RNC has aided the creation of a significant bloc of GOPers who are intent on seeing his departure next month. While some, such as black conservative group BOND Action, have directly announced their intentions to work toward insuring Steele's termination at the committee, other Republicans have simply lined up behind his growing list of challengers.\n Maria Cino, a former Bush official who recently received key backing from former RNC Chairman Ed Gillespie and former Vice President Dick Cheney, became the latest official contender this weekend.\n Wisconsin GOP Chairman Reince Preibus, recently resigned RNC political director Gentry Collins, former U.S. ambassador Ann Wagner and former Michigan GOP chairman Saul Anuzis also round out the list. Politico also reports that former Senator Norm Coleman could enter the race if Steele decides not to run.\n",

No laws for you!\n In a letter signed by the 42 members of the Republican caucus, delivered to the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, and mentioned Wednesday on the Senate floor by the minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republicans informed their Democratic counterparts that they would not go forward with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153any legislative item until the Senate has acted to fund the government and we have prevented the tax increase that is currently awaiting all American taxpayers.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The letter goes on: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With little time left in this Congressional session, legislative scheduling should be focused on these critical priorities.  While there are other items that might ultimately be worthy of the Senate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention, we cannot agree to prioritize any matters above the critical issues of funding the government and preventing a job-killing tax hike.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Washington is locked in a battle over what to do about the Bush-era tax cuts, which expire at the end of the year.  President Obama and Democratic lawmakers want to extend the cuts to all Americans except those with income above $250,000, while Republicans want tax cuts extended to Americans at all income levels.  Another idea that has been kicking around over the last few weeks \u00e2\u20ac\u201d proposed by some Democrats \u00e2\u20ac\u201d is raising the expiration income ceiling to households with at least $1 million in income.\n At the same time, Congress needs to make a legislative move to keep the government funded before the 112th Congress takes over in January.\n Democrats were hoping to force a more ambitious agenda into the final weeks, including the ratification of the New Start treaty, a military authorization bill that would repeal the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d provision, the extension of unemployment funds and the Dream Act, an immigration bill.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If they really cared about creating jobs, they should stop blocking a preservation of unemployment insurance, which would create or save hundred of thousands of jobs,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Jim Manley, a spokesman for Mr. Reid, said in an e-mail.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unfortunately this letter is nothing new.  Republicans have simply put in writing their political strategy which they have pursued over the last two years: obstruct and delay action on critical matters, and then blame the Democrats for not addressing the needs of the American people.  This strategy is very cynical but very obvious and transparent.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:\n Correction: December 1, 2010\n Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this post said that Senator Harry Reid was from Arizona. He is from Nevada.\n Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, two of the strongest Republican critics of the Obama administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s handling of the Benghazi attack, offered support nonetheless for the nomination of Victoria Nuland, who helped edit the much-disputed talking points about the incident.\n President Obama and Gov. Chris Christie, Republican of New Jersey, will reprise their pre-election tour of the coastal areas ravaged by Hurricane Sandy on Tuesday, a White House official said Friday morning.\n",

Tea party organizers disputed claims of racism and called on the NAACP to withdraw the resolution.\n Debate was mostly closed to the public, but the final version \"calls on the tea party and all people of good will to repudiate the racist element and activities within the tea party,\" said Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP's Washington bureau.\n \"I hope it will empower the tea party to actually look at itself and see that there are those who are noticing things that I think most tea partiers don't want,\" he said.\n Sarah Palin, a vocal tea party supporter, said in a statement late Tuesday that she was \"saddened by the NAACP's claim that patriotic Americans ... are somehow 'racists.'\" The former Alaska governor said claims that tea party activists \"judge people by the color of their skin\" were false and appalling.\n The final wording won't be released until the NAACP's national board of directors approves the resolution during its meeting in October. But the original called for the NAACP to \"educate its membership and the community that this movement is not just about higher taxes and limited government.\" It said something could evolve \"and become more dangerous for that small percentage of people that really think our country has been taken away from them.\"\n \"We felt the time had come to stand up and say, 'It's time for the tea party to be responsible members of this democracy and make sure they don't tolerate bigots or bigotry among their members,'\" NAACP President Ben Jealous said ahead of the debate.\n \"We don't have a problem with the tea party's existence. We have an issue with their acceptance and welcoming of white supremacists into their organizations,\" he said.\n Tea party activist Alex Poulter, who co-founded a Kansas City-area group called Political Chips, also disputed the allegations. He said the movement is made up of a \"diverse group of folks who are upset with what is going on with this country.\"\n Poulter said he has seen no evidence of racism within the movement.\n \"It's unfounded, but people are running with these accusations like they are true,\" he said.\n A group called the St. Louis Tea Party issued its own resolution Tuesday calling on the NAACP to withdraw the proposal.\n Though not affiliated with either major political party, tea party activists espouse a political philosophy of less government, a free market, lower taxes, individual rights and political activism.\n The group has faced occasional claims of racism, most notably in March near the end of the bitter health care debate. U.S. Reps. John Lewis, Andre Carson and Emanuel Cleaver said some demonstrators, many of them tea party activists, yelled a racial epithet as the black congressmen walked from House office buildings to the Capitol. Cleaver, D-Mo., also said he was spit on.\n A white lawmaker said he also heard the epithets, but conservative activists said the lawmakers were lying.\n \"They are pulling people together and focusing on the negative, and then it's hard to make anything positive out of that,\" said Anita L. Russell, president of the Kansas City, Mo., branch of the NAACP, which introduced the resolution. \"And then these groups, these extremist groups, are looking for something, and they are latching on to this.\"\n",

Republicans have consistently supported the effort. Indeed, as the DNC Communications Director (of all people) has said, your statement \u00e2\u20ac\u0153puts [you] at odds with about 100 percent of the Republican Party.\n And not on a trivial matter. At a time when Gen. Petraeus has just taken over command, when Republicans in Congress are pushing for a clean war funding resolution, when Republicans around the country are doing their best to rally their fellow citizens behind the mission, your comment is more than an embarrassment. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an affront, both to the honor of the Republican party and to the commitment of the soldiers fighting to accomplish the mission they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been asked to take on by our elected leaders.\n There are, of course, those who think we should pull out of Afghanistan, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re certainly entitled to make their case. But one of them shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the chairman of the Republican party.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Kristol\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s was the harshest of all the reactions to the Steele, whose spokesman, it should be noted, tried to clarify the comment by insisting that he merely meant that President Obama has not been forthcoming with a winning strategy.\n But the Weekly Standard editor was not alone.\n Another major neoconservative figure, Dan Senor, told the Huffington Post that Steele\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153utterly irresponsible.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Senor, who served under the Bush administration as chief spokesman in Iraq and has been a major booster of efforts to escalate U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, noted that Steele\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s RNC actually sponsored a conference call for his group to praise Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Afghan surge last year.\n Indeed, even Steele himself declared back in December that Afghanistan is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u2122a war we have to win\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a far cry from the comments he made Thursday night, in which he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153...you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do is engage in a land war in Afghanistan, alright, because everyone who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tried over a thousand years of history has failed.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s completely inconsistent with this latest statement,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d summarized Senor.\n In a bit of irony, Steele\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent comments have actually resonated among anti-war Democrats who share the skepticism that Afghanistan is a winnable enterprise. They also, in some respects, echo the opinions of some members of the conservative community (Joe Scarborough and George Will among them) who have been critical of the deployment of U.S. forces in that country.\n But Steele is not an anti-war Democrat. Nor is he a pundit. He is the figurehead of the Republican Party whose tenure, once again, seems shaky. Shortly after Kristol called for his resignation, a GOP operative began pitching the column to reporters, hoping that the meme of Steele\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubles would spread far and wide.\n",

Beck wrote \"Progressivism\" on it to underscore his belief in what America is suffering from.\n When Beck asked what America is suffering from, someone shouted \"President Obama,\" though Beck, an outspoken critic of the president, said it's \"not that simple.\"\n Beck rejected the notion that the Republican Party should expand its tent to include progressives.\n \"What is this? A circus?\" he said, drawing laughter. \"America is not a clown show. America is an idea that sets people free.\"\n Opening up about his troubled past, Beck told the crowd, \"People need to understand that life is not fair. The bad guy sometimes wins.\"\n The speech capped three days of panel discussions and high-profile speakers, including numerous politicians mentioned as contenders for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. But for a lot of the CPAC attendees, Beck was the reason they came, as he is seen as a leader in the new conservative movement.\n The speech comes after a year in which Beck's growing popularity as a Fox News host coincided with the rise of the Tea Party Movement and populist rage directed at Washington. Beck also launched the 9/12 Project, which sets forth nine values and 12 principles that he believes the country was founded upon. The project inspired a major march in Washington in September.\n \"This is how is America should be,\" said Cynthia Burgiss, 22, a student at the University of Dayton in Ohio who attended the 9/12 march in D.C. this year. \"People of every race, political affiliation, religion came together for different reasons.\"\n She was at CPAC to see Beck and called him a \"relatable ... everyday guy.\"\n \"None of this would have happened without Glenn,\" she said.\n",

Do you fully support the Obama agenda?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Etheridge appears visibly irritated and immediately asks, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153who are you?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d before knocking the interviewer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s camera to the ground.\n In the next shot, Etheridge grabs the reporter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrist and continually asks him to identify himself. The cameraman replies, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just here for a project...we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just students.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Over at Big Government, a post accompanying the video provides the following commentary on the encounter:\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Expect more of this. A hard, progressive left captured the Democrat majority in Congress and forced them to enact a fantasy grab-bag of legislation that is increasingly unpopular with the American public. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on the cusp of a deeper recession, millions of unemployed Americans have no prospect for work, taxes are about to spike higher and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve maxed out the national credit card. The Democrats were given a chance to run government and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve only succeeded in running it into the ground. [...]\n Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recap what we saw on this video. A sitting Congressman-a presumed living extension of James Madison and other founding fathers-was asked on a public street whether he supported the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda. His response was to hit away a video camera and assault a student. The age of Pericles this ain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.\n It is going to be a long, hot summer. But, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been given a target. Act accordingly.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mediaite, in a response to the Big Government post, writes about the problems with anonymous inflammatory assault interviews, and argues that it might be this new brand of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153journalism\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d that has Etheridge on edge:\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now, Etheridge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions are only partially defensible. He need not have gotten physical with the students who asked him the provocative question regarding his support of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Obama Agenda\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d (honestly, that sort of opening question is straight from the Jason Mattera school of inflammatory interview techniques.)\n But little is known about these \u00e2\u20ac\u0153students.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d The YouTube video is published under an account titled TonyManization, and even more damning is that the faces of the individuals asking the Congressman questions are blurred out. Hmmm...nothing like the courage of the anonymous protester.\n Which brings us back to Etheridge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response. Yeah - he comes off as a jerk, but...when in Rome. It will be interesting to follow how this story plays out in the news media. Will it be a big story? Probably not, but apparently being prepared for ambush interviews from eager college kids is the next phase of media training for many on Capitol Hill.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n UPDATE:\n DNC spokesman Brad Woodhouse addressed the video in a statement Monday:\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Motives matter, and I think you can see who was behind this,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Woodhouse said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was a Republican party tracking operation. If it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a party tracker or intern, why is the face blurred and why is the source hidden? You know if it had been a right wing blog, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d identify themselves and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be booking this person on TV all day. Republicans know if they admit their involvement in this game of gotcha it will undermine their credibility. One minute this guy is interviewing a member of Congress on camera and the next a video is released with his face blurred out? If that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you this is a Republican Party hatchet job nothing will.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n UPDATE:\n Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) has apologized for his combative behavior over the weekend in a statement released by his office:\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I deeply and profoundly regret my reaction and I apologize to all involved,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Etheridge said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Throughout my many years of service to the people of North Carolina, I have always tried to treat people from all viewpoints with respect. No matter how intrusive and partisan our politics can become, this does not justify a poor response. I have and I will always work to promote a civil public discourse.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Congressman Apologizes for Physical Confrontation With Man in Washington\n\nPUBLISHED: 2010/06/14\n\nThree days after an Internet video surfaced showing North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge in a physical confrontation with a young man, the lawmaker said he is \"profoundly\" sorry for the tussle on a Washington street.\n Etheridge, a Democrat, is seen in an amateur video grabbing the wrist and neck of an unidentified young man after the man approached the congressman and asked if he supported the \"Obama agenda.\"\n \"No matter how partisan and no matter how difficult things get sometimes, that's no excuse for my response,\" he added, shortly after releasing a written statement in which he said he \"profoundly\" regrets the incident.\n The video, posted to YouTube last Friday, shows the man, who appears to be in his early 20s and who identifies himself as a student, approaching Etheridge on the sidewalk.\n Etheridge is then seen trying to snatch a cell phone camera out of the student's hands. He then grabs the man's wrist and refuses to let go.\n \"Who are you!\" the seven-term congressman demands. \"Tell me who you are ... I have a right to know who you are.\"\n Another man, not seen on camera, then tells Etheridge, \"We're just here for a project.\"\n When the man asks Etheridge to \"please let go of me,\" the congressman then grabs him by the neck.\n Etheridge told reporters that he hasn't apologized to the young men involved because \"I dont know who they are.\"\n \"I would if I knew who they were,\" he said.\n \"I've been spat at, pushed and threatened before but that's no excuse,\" he added, saying that the incident occurred after a \"long day.\"\n \"His conduct is unbecoming of a member of Congress. It's bad enough that he's joined Obama's assault on North Carolina jobs, but his physical assault on a college student goes beyond the pale.\"\n Mike Flynn, a conservative blogger for biggovernment.com, wrote that the confrontation occurred last week outside a fundraiser headlined by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n The video, which was posted on YouTube by \"DCCameraGuy,\" does not reveal the identity of the men making the tape.\n Etheridge, who has represented North Carolina's 2nd Congressional District since 1997, is running for re-election against Republican Renee Ellmers, a registered nurse, in November. Political observers have predicted that the 68-year-old congressman will likely hold on to his seat.\n Etheridge, a member of the House Ways and Means and Budget committees, voted in favor of President Obama's health care overhaul legislation as well as the Democratic climate change bill known by opponents as cap-and-trade. \n",

By Saturday, the president clarified that he was not speaking about the \"wisdom\" of the Islamic cultural center per se, just the right of the group to build the Cordoba House in downtown Manhattan.\n And on Monday the highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate officially came out against construction of the mosque in its current location\n \"The First Amendment protects freedom of religion,\" reads a statement from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's office (D-Nev.). \"Senator Reid respects that but thinks that the mosque should be built someplace else. If the Republicans are being sincere, they would help us pass this long overdue bill to help the first responders whose health and livelihoods have been devastated because of their bravery on 911, rather than continuing to block this much-needed legislation.\"\n Combined, Obama's clarification and Reid's opposition represent a double dose of bad news for progressives and even Republicans who believed that a strong case could be made in favor of Cordoba House. If anything, it's clearer now than it was last week (when Democrats were mostly silent on the matter) how deeply the party just wants this entire issue to go away. Reid, after all, only issued the above statement after his Republican opponents began hitting him for going silent on the matter.\n",

But it certainly was debatable. Summers himself, downplayed the significance of continuing the Bush tax cuts back in September -- though he was speaking, then, about the rates for the rich and the tax cut deal, at that point in time, did not include money for a 13-month extension of unemployment insurance or other tax incentives to help lower income workers.\n Asked whether the country would find itself dipping towards the economic doldrums if Congress waited a month or two to get a tax cut package passed, Rob Shapiro, a former commerce official in the Clinton White House and a proponent of the current tax cut deal, offered more sober-minded analysis.\n \"The wait would not cause a double dip,\" he said. \"A double dip would come out of the reality of a relatively contractionary fiscal policy... I do think the deal that they announced is stimulative. And it ought to boost growth by some increment... But the issue is, that the deal certainly is not enough to lift the economy to a different place. Will we see what happened with the large stimulus happen here, which is once the stimulus is over the economy returns to slow growth? That's the danger. And I keep on saying this, the single most important thing they can do to avert that is to stabilize housing prices.\"\n Stabilizing the housing market, however, is not on the current congressional docket. And on Wednesday, the White House began a robust process of selling the deal to Democrats -- skeptical, as they are, about an extension of Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and a generous revision of the estate tax.\n There were few carrots to go along with the sticks. Asked, for instance, if the White House would be willing to revise the informal compromise to bring more Democratic lawmakers on board, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said any changes would be fine, so long as they didn't result in decreased support. Then he cautioned: \"The physics and the blood and the sweat that might be involved in that, I'm not entirely sure I would put it quite as simply as that.\"\n If anything, the pitch being offered from the administration to the rest of the party was: take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn.\n \"I guess the question back for those who ask [why not fight for more] is where does this go, what is the end game and what are the consequences of playing it?\" said senior adviser David Axelrod. \"Do they have a sense of how this ends and how long will that take, because as Larry said there are real consequences to that. Just as the forecasts went up on the basis of this agreement they will go down if this agreement fails. That we know. We know that on January 1 people's taxes will go up, we know that at the end of this month 2 million people will lose their unemployment insurance. And so there are real consequences to that decision. We, I think we all stipulate, the president did, no one likes those provisions that they dislike but on the other side of the ledger are significant things that will help people and help the economy. And what we know for sure is that without any of it we are facing a really difficult situation.\"\n Added Gibbs: \"I think you would really have to ask somebody who says... lets have some eight week fight and on February the 15th come in and say, alright, now we are ready to make a compromise, who on earth, who on earth thinks that that is somehow going to be a fundamentally better agreement than the one we are looking at right now? No one I have ever talked to.\"\n",

Democrats want them extended for all but the wealthy, while Republicans want them extended for everybody.\n President Obama met with top GOP and Democratic congressional leaders Tuesday but left the nitty-gritty negotiations to the panel -- he assigned Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and budget director Jacob Lew to represent the administration.  Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., the representative for Senate Democrats, indicated Wednesday he's not worried about the impact the GOP letter will have on the talks.\n \"We have full confidence we're going to be able to handle all of this very well,\" he said.\n But with Republicans vowing to deprive Democrats of the 60 votes they need to move toward a vote on virtually anything until these issues are addressed, negotiators will have to move quickly if they want to get to other matters before a new, more Republican Congress is sworn in next month.\n The administration is still looking to repeal the military's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy after the Pentagon issued a report Tuesday claiming the policy shift would not harm the military in the long-run.\n Democrats also want to extend long-term jobless benefits, which expired Tuesday.  A memo circulated by a GOP analyst noted that Reid so far has not been able to peel off any Republicans to support the measure to give benefits beyond 99 weeks.\n The lame-duck Congress so far has approved a food safety bill, which still needs a final vote in the House, and a $4.5 billion settlement payment to black farmers and American Indians who claimed they were discriminated against by the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Interior.\n Lawmakers also passed a one-month extension of the \"doc fix\" that prevents cuts to Medicare approved 15 years ago from going into effect, but without action the rates paid to doctors for treating those insured by the entitlement program will plummet on Jan. 1.\n It's not just Republicans who are concerned about the way the lame-duck session became a dumping ground for campaign promises and wish-list legislation. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., was caught on a hot mic in the Senate ripping the lame-duck agenda, which was set exclusively by his party, as \"rigged\" and done without a discussion among members.\n Aside from the tax rates, lawmakers must pass this week a continuing resolution to keep the government functioning.  Election-harried Democrats opted against producing a budget at all this year, preferring to punt questions on tax rates and spending until after Nov. 2.  So, the government relies on a series of patches to keep operating. Similarly, lawmakers must vote on a supplemental appropriation to fund military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n The filibuster threat increases pressure on the White House to offer a more realistic agenda for the remaining weeks of the year.  For example, if Congress doesn't act on the tax cuts, it means Republicans will be in position to enact their own, retroactive plan starting Jan. 1 without having to make any concessions to Democratic demands for upper-income earners.\n",

A senior Democratic staffer told The Huffington Post that it was likely to happen tonight or tomorrow. If it happens tonight, any of the bills could come before the Senate for a vote on proceeding to full debate as soon as Friday or possibly early next week.\n \"It had been my intention to file cloture on both of these bills last evening,\" said Reid on the Senate floor on Tuesday, \"however, supporters of the original bills requested that some modifications be made. These changes are reflected in the bills. I intend to move forward on both of these pieces of legislation. In addition, I intend to file cloture this week on the 9/11 health bill. I'll file cloture on all three of these at the same time.\"\n \"We already have things on the calendar,\" said the Democratic staffer, noting that right now, it doesn't appear as if tax cuts will come before these measures that are already in the queue.\n There could be some cracks in the GOP coalition to stand firm against any non-budget or tax cuts legislation though. Sen. Susan Collins' (R-Maine) is reportedly open to voting to proceed on repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell, even if the other issues aren't yet resolved.\n Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) recently introduced a compromise bill on extending unemployment benefits. There's no indication yet that it will make it to the floor anytime soon, but if it did come up before a vote on the Bush tax cuts, it would put Brown in the tough spot of voting against his legislation or breaking with his party. Brown's office did not respond to The Huffington Post's request for comment.\n",

Rather than go ahead with the debate and declare that he will not run \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Mr. Trump has flirted with running for president several times since the 1980s but has always decided not to follow through \u00e2\u20ac\u201d he chose to drop the debate.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I must leave all of my options open because, above all else, we must make America great again!\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n Mr. Trump was facing a potentially awkward task: moderating a debate that only two candidates said they would attend. Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum were the only two Republicans who agreed to participate. Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann, Jon M. Huntsman Jr. and Ron Paul all declined, putting a big dent in Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s self-proclaimed status as Republican kingmaker.\n Mr. Trump issued the following exclamation-point laden statement through his lawyer, Michael Cohen.\n",

President Obama has again mistaken America's tolerance for different lifestyles with an endorsement of those lifestyles.\"\n Politico reported Tuesday that Perry bought $1 million in broadcast television time ahead of the Jan. 3 caucuses.

Michele Bachmann has declined to get into the scrum with Newsweek over its cover story of the presidential candidate called \"The Queen of Rage,\" accompanied by an unflattering photo of the Minnesota Republican, but others are calling the magazine out of bounds in its depiction.\n The National Organization for Women President Terry O'Neill said that the cover of the magazine's latest edition is \"sexist\" and referred to a simple test by the group's founder Gloria Steinem to explain how they determined that conclusion -- would the magazine do the same to a man.\n \"Who has ever called a man 'The King of Rage?' Basically what Newsweek magazine -- and this is important, what Newsweek magazine, not a blog, Newsweek magazine -- what they are saying of a woman who is a serious contender for president of the United States of America\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 They are basically casting her as a nut job,\" O'Neill said to The Daily Caller and NOW confirmed to FoxNews.com on Tuesday.\n \"The 'Queen of Rage' is something you apply to wrestlers or somebody who is crazy. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even do this to Howard Dean when he had his famous scream,\" she said.\n Newsweek has defended the photo -- an extreme close-up of the crystal blue-eyed Bachmann looking over the camera with a dark blue background -- saying that several of the images taken of her appeared the same way. The magazine posted other photos of her on its website, and many of them are flattering.\n Bachmann was asked about the cover during an appearance in Iowa on Monday, where she is campaigning ahead of Thursday's Fox News/Washington Examiner debate and Saturday's Ames Straw Poll. She told voters she had not seen the cover.\n \"Ah-hah,\" she said when told the story headline. \"Well, we'll have to take a look at that, won't we?\"\n O'Neill said that the main reason her group, which disagrees with Bachmann on almost every issue, would stand up for and defend Bachmann against \"these kind of misogynistic attacks is we want women to run for office.\"\n \"Of course my job is to defeat Michele Bachmann and I intend to do so. But good women will not run for office if Newsweek magazine can do this to such a prominent politician and get away with it,\" O'Neill said.\n Brent Bozell, head of the Media Research Center and ForAmerica, said he's not surprised by the magazine cover.\n \"Both Time and Newsweek have been doing this to conservatives for years. It is sheer journalistic dishonesty,\" Bozell told FoxNews.com. \"But it is precisely because of this journalistic dishonesty that conservatives should steer away from these venues -- or at least demand some form of editorial oversight given that these magazines simply cannot be trusted.\"\n",

He tweaked House Republicans for passing a resolution on Tuesday reaffirming the national motto, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In God We Trust,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d when they should be creating jobs.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I trust in God,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Obama said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but God wants to see us help ourselves by putting people back to work!\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Invoking patriotism as well as divine intervention \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mr. Obama stood against the backdrop of a giant American flag \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he spoke before an audience that included unemployed construction workers, whose industry is among the hardest hit by the housing bust.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m joining many of these workers to say that it makes absolutely no sense when there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so much work to be done that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not doing the work,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Obama said to their applause. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not when there are so many roads and bridges and runways waiting to be repaired and waiting to be rebuilt.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s short trip from the White House to the event stage on the Potomac riverfront came more than a month after he began campaigning throughout the country for his jobs plan, building public pressure on Republicans but winning no votes from them. Mr. Obama singled out the Republican leaders of the House and Senate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just as he did in September when he visited an aging bridge over the Ohio River that connects their two states.\n Mr. Obama said the two leaders and other Republicans had supported public-works investments in the past. But Republicans oppose Mr. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $447 billion job-creation plan, which also includes tax cuts for workers and employers and state aid to avoid layoffs of teachers, police officers and firefighters, because the package would be paid for with higher taxes on those with taxable income of more than $1 million a year.\n For the same reason, some leading business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Associated General Contractors of America, have withdrawn support for the infrastructure spending bill, though Mr. Obama cited the Chamber as a supporter in his remarks.\n The House has declined to take up Mr. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jobs package, while Senate Democrats could not muster the 60 votes needed to block a Republican filibuster against either the full $447 billion package or a $35 billion piece providing state aid, mostly for teachers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pay. With White House support, Senate Democrats have broken the measure into its main parts to force Republicans to take a series of tough votes on proposals, each of which has broad public support, according to polls.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The American people are with me with this,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Obama said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for folks running around spending all their time talking about what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrong with America to spend some time rolling up their sleeves to help us make it right. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing wrong in this country that we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fix.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The outcome in the Senate on the infrastructure spending provision, however, is not expected to be any different from the previous two votes.\n Mr. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, a former Republican congressman from Illinois, appeared with him at the Key Bridge and then went to the Capitol to meet with lawmakers.\n In response to Mr. Obama, House Republicans said the Democratic-controlled Senate should take up some 16 House-passed measures; most would attack federal regulations or spending and would have long-term impact, analysts say, but they would not spur job creation in the coming year or two.\n Mr. Boehner facetiously said that Mr. Obama, as a former Democratic senator, could help: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure he has great influence over there in terms of getting them to take up these bills that really will help put the American people back to work.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

But Mr. Richtman said the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s openness to considering future cuts would no doubt be used by deficit hawks to push for immediate cuts in Social Security benefits as part of the debate over deficit reduction.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tragic that AARP would, wittingly or unwittingly, play into the hands of people who have never really liked Social Security and want to decimate it,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Richtman said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153AARP is the 800-pound gorilla, but they do not speak for seniors.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Republican leaders, who have led calls for revamping Social Security, had no immediate comments on AARP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s willingness to consider benefit reductions.\n An aide to the Republican-led House Ways and Means Committee, who spoke on condition of anonymity under committee protocol, said AARP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position was a welcome acknowledgment that Social Security would be unable to pay future benefits at the current rate and that it must be restructured.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The longer we wait,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the aide said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the more difficult it will be to protect current beneficiaries and those who rely on Social Security the most.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The most recent projections from the Social Security Administration, issued last month, indicate that at the current rate, the program\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trust funds will be exhausted by 2036, and that $6.5 trillion in additional money will be needed over a 75-year period to pay all scheduled benefits.\n Mr. Rother said AARP expected to hear criticism from some of its members over its position on possible cuts.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have such a broad membership, Mr. Rother said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure there will be some who will not be happy, but others will be eager to see the program put on a stronger financial footing for the long term.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n While AARP has not issued specific recommendations or figures on how benefit reductions might be carried out, the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent discussions with its members signal support for using increased revenue to fill two-thirds of the projected gap, and benefits reductions for one-third, Mr. Rother said.\n As word of AARP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position set off debate in Washington on Friday, the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Barry Rand, issued a formal statement saying that the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position had not changed in any substantive way and refuting what he described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153misleading\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d media reports.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let me be clear \u00e2\u20ac\u201d AARP is as committed as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever been to fighting to protect Social Security for today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seniors and strengthening it for future generations,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Rand said.\n While he did not directly address the question of possible cuts in benefits in his statement, Mr. Rand said his group would be working to evaluate any proposed changes in Social Security \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to determine how each might \u00e2\u20ac\u201d individually or in different combinations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d impact the lives of current and future retirees.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed Mr. Trump as the most favored candidate among Republicans who consider themselves Tea Party supporters.\n Mr. Obama has shown a certificate of live birth from Hawaii, which is the standard form of birth certificate in the state, and state officials \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including the Republican who was governor during the 2008 campaign \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have confirmed its authenticity. Several conservatives, including Glenn Beck and Bill O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Reilly, have criticized Mr. Trump for raising questions about it.\n But polls show that many Republicans continue to believe that Mr. Obama was not born in this country, and therefore is not eligible to be president.\n Kelly Townsend, a founder of the Greater Phoenix Tea Party, said Mr. Trump told them that he was interested in learning more about the legislation in Arizona.\n The bill, which has been approved by committees of the House and Senate, allows great latitude to the secretary of state in denying a presidential candidate a spot on the ballot, saying that the secretary can do so if he or she believes that the documents do not prove citizenship.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a birther bill,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ms. Townsend said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not about Mr. Obama. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about preventing any questions from coming up in the future, putting something in place so no one could question it.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But a release from Mr. Seel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office about the planned meeting noted that Mr. Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has brought the issue of President Barack Obama failing to provide a birth certificate front and center recently.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Ms. Townsend said she had her own agenda for the meeting at Trump Tower. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I want to invite him to Arizona to talk to people and to meet our leaders,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have a good audience with Tea Partiers.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Everybody recognizes that. And we're certainly willing to talk about a package of changes that will keep Social Security strong.\"\n He suggested raising the age at which retirees can receive full benefits -- currently, 66 years old -- would be on the table even though doing so represents \"a massive benefit cut for people.\"\n The 37 million-member lobbying powerhouse launched a national ad campaign Thursday warning members of Congress not to reduce benefits for recipients of Social Security and Medicare.\n Jonathan Cowan, president of centrist think tank Third Way, hailed AARP's apparent reversal, per the Journal story.\n \"Today marks a watershed moment in American politics,\" Cowan said. \"For decades, AARP has stood against any substantial changes to Social Security. Now that they have opened the door to reform, it is time for lawmakers to walk through it.\"\n Yet AARP reassured labor groups that it had not changed its position on Social Security, labor officials told HuffPost.\n \"The AARP has a history of division between the top folks and their base on these issues. The top folks like to be in the inside game,\" one union official said. \"But they are walking backwards now.\"\n The official said that he and other opponents of benefit cuts had been told that AARP's \"longstanding position\" hadn't changed, but there was some uncertainty about what that position actually is.\n If AARP is open to reducing benefits, it would be a major boost for Social Security reformers who say the program is too generous and therefore unaffordable.\n Social Security will start paying out more in benefits than it absorbs in taxes this year which will lead the retirement program's trust fund to become exhausted in 2036, according to the latest annual trustees report. After 2036, the program will only be able to pay 77 percent of promised benefits. By 2085, it will be able to pay 74 percent of promised benefits.\n As of April, 35 million seniors received Social Security retirement benefits averaging $1,179 a month, according to the program's latest monthly snapshot.\n Economists credit the program for drastically reducing poverty among the elderly since its creation in the 1930s. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive Washington think tank, estimates that Social Security keeps 13 million elderly Americans out of poverty.\n The Journal reported that AARP policy chief John Rother is pushing the organization to accept benefit cuts as part of a deal to make Social Security solvent. Rother's thinking, according to the paper, is that tax increases alone can't keep the program's $2.6 trillion trust fund from running out of money, so benefit cuts must be included as well.\n Social Security's retirement benefits are funded with taxes on incomes up to $106,800, known as the taxable earnings base. The base also effectively serves as a cap on benefits because they are calculated according to a worker's contributions over his or her lifetime.\n A September 2010 Congressional Research Service report found that lifting the cap, without also raising benefits, would make the program solvent for the foreseeable future.\n \"If all earnings were subject to the payroll tax, but the base was retained for benefit calculations, the Social Security Trust Funds would remain solvent for the next 75 years,\" said the report.\n \"There are dozens of ways modest tax increases on even just the very wealthiest Americans would restore Social Security to long-run actuarial balance, and there would be enough left over to increase benefits,\" said Nancy Altman, co-chair of Strengthen Social Security, a 300-member coalition of national and state organizations opposed to benefit cuts.\n The problem with plans to hike taxes is that they're politically unfeasible because of congressional Republicans' adamant opposition to any sort of tax increase, much less a tax increase not accompanied by a spending cut. President Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform drafted a plan that would tweak Social Security by increasing taxes and reducing benefits both. That proposal went nowhere.\n UPDATE: AARP CEO A. Barry Rand said in a statement, \"It has long been AARP's policy that Social Security should be strengthened to provide adequate benefits and that it is sufficiently financed to ensure solvency with a stable trust fund for the next 75 years.\" The statement does not deny that AARP is open to reducing benefits.\n",

He said that if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nominated, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to beat him straight up,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d not on the basis of the birth issue.\n A national NBC/WSJ poll released yesterday shows Trump tied for 2nd with Mike Huckabee in the 2012 GOP primary field at 17 percent (Mitt Romney leads the pack at 21 percent).\n NBC further notes, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Strikingly, Trump . . . finishes first among Tea Party supporters (at 20 percent), followed by Romney (17 percent), Huckabee (14 percent), Palin (12 percent) and Gingrich (9 percent).\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Trump said he didn't introduce the citizenship issue, but was asked about it during an interview a month ago. Since then, he said he's looked into it and believes \"there is a big possibility\" Obama may have violated the Constitution.\n \"I want to see the birth certificate,\" said Trump in an interview on NBC's \"Today\" show, according to TIME. \"How come his own family doesn't know which hospital he was born in? How come-- forget about birth certificates. Let's say there's no birth certificate. How come in the hospital itself, okay? This is one of the...in the hospital itself, there's no records of his birth. In other words, it doesn't say how much they paid, where is the doctor, here's your room bill.\"\n Officials in Hawaii have certified that Obama was born in that state. But \"birthers\" have demanded additional proof, asserting he could have been born in Kenya. \"I'm not convinced that he has one,\" Trump said of the birth certificate issue.\n \"Today\" show host Meredith Vieira asked Trump, \"You've been privy to all of this to know this?\" His response: \"Well, I have people that actually have been studying it and they cannot believe what they're talking.\"\n The remarks from the potential presidential candidate prompted Vieira to ask Trump if he had people on the ground in Hawaii searching for proof of the president's citizenship. He signaled he did, saying, \"And they cannot believe what they're finding. And I'm serious.\"\n When asked how genuine his presidential ambition is, Trump said, \"I always take things seriously, but I've never taken it seriously like this.\"\n \"I wish I didn't have to do it,\" he said.\n \"I wish this was the greatest place in the world,\" Trump said, but he also said jobs are disappearing in the United States and that Obama has given the country \"a terrible presidency.\"\n Trump said that if the current fight over budget issues forces a shutdown, \"I think the president will be blamed.\"\n He accused Obama of carrying out a confusing policy on the civil war in Libya, saying \"nobody knows what's happening, and now it looks like (Libyan strongman Moammar) Gadhafi is going to beat the United States.\"\n \"I'm only interested in Libya if we get the oil,\" Trump said. He said Obama \"doesn't have a doctrine (on foreign affairs.) Foreign affairs is, we take care of ourselves first\"\n Of Obama, he said, \"I want him to do well. ... I love this country, but this country is going to hell. ... The world laughs at us. They won't be laughing if I'm elected president.\"\n",

Is the photo of him? I can't say with certitude\" he told Russert.\n \"It was a prank,\" Weiner reiterated. \"This is not a national security matter. We're not making a federal case out of this.\"\n \"I'm not sure it rises -- no pun intended -- to that level,\" he continued.\n Weiner said he has hired a private security company to investigate how his account has been hacked.\n Last weekend, a lewd photo of a man's bulging underpants was sent to a 21-year-old female college student in Seattle from Weiner's Twitter account. It was quickly deleted, but a frenzy of coverage and comment ensued on blogs, cable news outlets and other media. Weiner's spokesman said that the congressman's Twitter account had been hacked and dismissed the episode as a prank, but this week the congressman hired a lawyer, prompting additional rumors to swirl.\n Earlier this week, the colorful and sometimes combative congressman who represents parts of Brooklyn and Queens was characteristically sharp tongued, refusing to answer reporters' questions about it, and even calling one a \"jackass\" for interrupting him. He insisted that he wanted to move on from the incident, which was distracting from his work on Capitol Hill. But there was no sign the story, or the speculation about who may have been responsible for tweeting the photo, was fading.\n Weiner failed in a 2005 bid for the Democratic nomination for mayor of New York City, but he is still is widely considered a future contender for the office.\n \"I'm not going to talk about this anymore,\" Weiner told reporters on Capitol Hill. \"I think that if I was giving a speech to 45,000 people and someone stood up and heckled in the back, I wouldn't spend three days talking to him. I'm going to get back to the conversation I care about.\"\n Weiner declined to answer reporters' questions about the photo or why he was hiring a lawyer for the case instead of having law enforcement officials pursue the matter. Weiner was a Twitter follower of the female college student who received the photo.\n The tweet of the lewd photo first was reported Saturday by BigGovernment.com, a website run by conservative commentator Andrew Breitbart.\n The site said the photo was tweeted to a female college student in Seattle. The woman told the New York Daily News that she had never met Weiner, and that there had \"never been any inappropriate exchanges\" between her and the congressman.\n Weiner, 46, is married to Huma Abedin, an aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n The congressman over the weekend joked about the incident on Twitter, asking whether his kitchen blender would be next to \"attack\" him.\n On Tuesday as the House was preparing to vote on the nation's debt limit, Weiner was back tweeting about the vote with his usual partisan edge.\n",

Weiner, trying to put to rest a bizarre episode that is overshadowing his role as liberal pugilist and threatening his dream of becoming New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mayor, emphatically denied on Wednesday that he had sent a suggestive photograph to a woman in Washington State but said he could not be sure that he is not the person in the image.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was essentially a hacked account that had a gag photo sent out on it,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Weiner, a Democrat, said during an interview in his office here. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say with certainty very much about where the photograph came from.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n On Tuesday, Mr. Weiner presided over two testy news briefings at which he had dodged a variety of questions. On Wednesday, he adopted a strikingly different approach, sitting patiently for a series of interviews at which he insisted he had done nothing wrong and marveled at what he said on MSNBC was the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Alice in Wonderland world\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d in which a wayward Twitter message had become the talk of the town.\n Mr. Weiner, one of Congress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most enthusiastic users of social media to engage with constituents and supporters, said he believed his Twitter account, or a related photo-sharing site, had been infiltrated by a hacker or a prankster, who had then sent the offending photo out late Friday.\n He said that he had hired an Internet security company and a lawyer to look into the matter, but that he did not believe the episode merited investigation by federal law enforcement. He did not rule out the possibility that the photo was of him, but said he did not know who could have sent it.\n He said he did not know the woman who received the photo, Gennette Cordova, a student at Whatcom Community College in Bellingham, Wash.; she followed him on Twitter. He said he regretted that Ms. Cordova was caught in the middle of the controversy. She issued a statement over the weekend saying she had never met him, and she has not spoken out since.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I just feel terrible for her,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Weiner said, adding that he had never corresponded with her. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She has committed no crime except to follow me on Twitter.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The congressman also expressed concern about the toll the episode was taking on his wife, Huma Abedin, a longtime aide to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m protecting my wife, who every day is waking up to these insane stories that are getting so far from reality,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he told CNN. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You know, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been married less than a year.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Asked on CNN whether he still wished to be mayor, he said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Put it this way: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the only better job than the one I have.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Jack Levin, the chief executive of yFrog, the Twitter-affiliated image and video service that was used to upload the photo, said in an interview on Wednesday that his company did not have reason to believe that its user passwords were exposed or stolen. He said it was possible that the photo could have been sent from Mr. Weiner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yFrog account through his Twitter password or through a yFrog password.\n Mr. Levin said neither Mr. Weiner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office nor any law enforcement authorities had contacted him or his company to inquire about the photo.\n Twitter, which does not comment on individual user accounts for privacy reasons, has declined to say whether Mr. Weiner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s account was hacked.\n Despite the swirl of events that has buffeted him for several days, Mr. Weiner has not abandoned his sharp humor. Suggesting that the photo might have been altered, he alluded to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Daily Show\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d sketch on Tuesday in which the comedian Jon Stewart, a longtime friend, had joked that the photo could not have been of the congressman.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have memory of this photograph,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Weiner said in the interview in his office. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But I also ... you know, Jon Stewart might have had it right last night: that there were elements of this photograph that might have been doctored.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He paused, then added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that. And I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want that to be the headline.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Rick Perry of Texas on Tuesday said he would back a federal policy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to detain and to deport every illegal alien that we apprehend.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Perry, in his most expansive comments about illegal immigration since last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Republican presidential debate, was not suggesting any rounding up of illegal immigrants, an aide later made clear, but calling for all people arrested or detained \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and later found to be undocumented \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to be expelled from the country after an expedited hearing.\n The candidate sought to draw a contrast with the Obama administration, which he criticized as having a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153catch-and-release\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d policy that allows some nonviolent illegal immigrants to be released back into the general public.\n It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153horrific policy,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Perry said.\n Backers of the policy say it allows officials to focus resources on deporting illegal immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes or who are a threat to the public safety or the national interest.\n With a little more than a month to go before the New Hampshire primary, the Texas governor is trying to shore up his credentials on immigration: On Tuesday he won an endorsement from one of the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most outspoken and controversial public officials on that issue: Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Ariz., who unabashedly calls himself the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153toughest sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d in the country.\n Appearing at Joey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Diner here, in the southern end of the state, Mr. Arpaio, who had also been courted by Representative Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain, praised what he called Mr. Perry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to interdict illegal crossings by sending Texas Rangers and other state law enforcement to the Texas border with Mexico.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just talk about it; he does something about it,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Arpaio said.\n Mr. Perry was widely criticized within his own party for backing a state plan that gives some children of illegal immigrants the same lower-cost in-state college tuition that is enjoyed by American citizens who attend the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public universities and who have been Texas residents at least three years.\n At one point he suggested that those who opposed his position were heartless. On Tuesday he repeated his apology for that comment, calling it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very inappropriate,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d his latest effort to try to win back some Republican primary voters who abandoned him as rivals sought to paint him as too soft on illegal immigration.\n But it remains to be seen how much an endorsement from Sheriff Arpaio will help him in this state, where Mr. Perry is polling far behind the leader, Mitt Romney. According to one recent poll, immigration was cited by only 4 percent of likely Republican voters as the most important issue.\n Mr. Arpaio is also a polarizing figure. Last year, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against the sheriff for not cooperating with an investigation into whether the Maricopa County Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Department is systematically violating the rights of Hispanics. It was the first time in a generation, according to officials, that the federal government has filed suit to force a law enforcement agency to cooperate with such an investigation.\n The sheriff has called the Justice Department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s action an attempt to intimidate him and he has said he does not engage in racial profiling. Mr. Arpaio, who gained wide notice for forcing inmates to wear pink underwear and housing them in tents, is popular in his state, where he has repeatedly won re-election by a sizable margin.\n Even so, there are signs that the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aggressive immigration policies have begun to turn off some: Earlier this month a longtime Arpaio ally, Arizona State Sen. Russell Pearce, was defeated in a recall election by a more moderate Republican. Mr. Pearce had pushed through a controversial law last year that would have turned police officers throughout the state into de facto immigration agents.\n The Justice Department is fighting the law, which has not taken effect yet. On Tuesday, Mr. Perry signaled that he would not support the continuation of that lawsuit if he were elected president, saying that the federal government should not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153be suing states for making decisions that they think\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d are in the best interests of their citizens.\n",

It also claims that despite a company policy expressly prohibiting discrimination, local store managers are given too much flexibility in determining salary hikes and job promotions that invariably favor men over women.\n This dual argument that confounded Justice Kennedy also drew the ire of Justice Antonin Scalia who said he was whipsawed by the claims. \"If somebody tells you how to exercise discretion, you don't have discretion,\" he said.\n Chief Justice John Roberts also offered his doubts about the merits of lawsuit, suggesting that any discriminatory acts at Wal-Mart are no worse than anywhere else.\n \"Is it true that Wal-Mart's pay disparity across the company was less than the national average?\" he asked.\n Sellers said that wasn't a fair comparison because Wal-Mart has an obligation under federal law to make sure its managers do not discriminate.\n The case started a decade ago when Wal-Mart worker Betty Dukes said the management at her Pittsburg, Calif., store was bypassing her for promotions. \"I could see the men going forth and the women in the store stayed in the basic positions they were always in,\" Dukes once told an interviewer.\n Her discrimination claims were folded into a class action lawsuit covering all current female Wal-Mart employees and any who worked for the company going back to late 1998. Two lower courts said the case could move toward trial. Wal-Mart's appeal is asking the Supreme Court to stop the case from ever getting to a trial judge.\n On Tuesday, Dukes walked out of the courthouse full of confidence and poise saying she feels no anger toward her bosses or anyone else. \"Wal-Mart may be a big company and that is no doubt.\n But they are not big enough where they can't be challenged in a court of law. If you do wrong, then you should be held accountable. From the least of us to the greatest of us.\"\n Dukes's case has drawn the attention of the larger business community who fear that if the justices allow the case to proceed, it will open the doors to more class action lawsuits. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and major corporations including Bank of America, General Electric and Microsoft submitted briefs in the case supporting Wal-Mart.\n Much of the hour-long argument delved into the tedious details of class action law and if the Wal-Mart women could properly certify their claims into a single case. Wal-Mart lawyer Theodore Boutrous argued that every member of the class couldn't possibly meet a standard of commonality to justify the lawsuit.\n \"Our expert's report and testimony showed that at 90 percent of the stores, there was no pay disparity,\" Boutrous told the court. \"And that's the kind of -- and even putting that aside, the plaintiffs needed to come forward with something that showed that there was this miraculous recurrence at every decision across every store of stereotyping, and the evidence simply doesn't show that.\"\n Another technical concern that appears to work against the women covers the different types of remedies they are seeking. In addition to the punitive damages they want an injunction that would force Wal-Mart to adopt more stringent anti-discrimination policies. But those two remedies require different standards for class certification and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said it was \"a very serious problem\" in the case to try and sue for punitive damages after only obtaining certification under the lower threshold required for the injunction.\n It's possible that instead of an outright victory for Wal-Mart, the justices could issue a split decision of sorts and allow only the injunction part of the lawsuit to move forward. That potential ruling would get Wal-Mart off the hook for any financial damages.\n",

Bush's push to partially privatize Social Security, has decided to accept cuts -- though it would reportedly push for tax hikes to close most of the long-term Social Security shortfall.\n AARP CEO Barry Rand later issued a statement calling the article \"misleading\" and claiming \"AARP has not changed its position on Social Security.\"\n He said AARP remains opposed to cutting Social Security for the sake of deficit reduction and to any privatization plan. \"We are currently fighting proposals to cut Social Security to pay the nation's bills,\" he said.\n However, AARP legislative policy director David Certner told Fox News that Social Security needs a \"package of revenue and benefit adjustments ... to make it solvent.\"\n While the AARP claims its position on strengthening Social Security remains unchanged, others outside the organization detected a shift.\n Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who on Thursday unveiled her own Social Security reform package, said Friday that the AARP has marked \"a huge shift in the debate on the solvency of Social Security.\"\n \"AARP's new and welcome position is a positive step towards the type of reforms I've championed, and I look forward to working with the organization to shape the changes in a way that makes the least detrimental impact to present and future retirees,\" she said in a statement.\n There is still plenty of space between the kind of plan Hutchison is calling for and what groups like the AARP would accept.\n Hutchison's plan does not include tax hikes. Her office claims the bill would cut deficits by $416 billion over the next decade and keep Social Security solvent by instead raising the retirement age to 69 over 16 years and cutting yearly cost-of-living adjustments by 1 percent. Workers who are 58 and older would not be affected.\n \"Those two things would keep our Social Security system solvent for 75 years with really, I think, minor pain and a big gain,\" she told Fox News on Thursday.\n But the AARP has told Fox News that Hutchison's proposal is not acceptable.\n Asked about the possibility of Social Security entering budget talks at some point, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney reiterated past statements in saying President Obama does not see Social Security as a \"driver\" of the country's near-term deficits.\n \"The president supports measures to strengthen Social Security, but he does not support anything that would slash benefits for future generations,\" Carney said Friday.\n The back-and-forth comes amid new warnings about the future of Social Security. Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Fund last week warned the Social Security Trust Fund will be exhausted in 2036 and under current law, seniors would then face a 23 percent across-the-board cut in benefits.\n But the president's budget director told Fox News that even when the trust funds run out, both Social Security and Medicare would still have some income.\n \"We have a little bit of time,\" said Jack Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget. \"We do have a challenge, but it's not that we fall off of a cliff.\"\n With AARP potentially backing off its opposition, other groups are poised to take up the fight. A coalition of groups called Strengthen Social Security has railed against cuts to cost-of-living adjustments, recently releasing a report claiming \"even the modest COLA on which Social Security benefits are adjusted isn't safe.\"\n",

Anthony Weiner, in an interview with Fox News, said Wednesday he's certain he did not send a lewd photo of somebody's bulging underwear to a college student via Twitter. But the congressman repeatedly declined to say whether the picture was an image of him.\n The congressman, who described the incident as \"mischief,\" continued to allege that he was the victim of a computer hacker. He said he's asked an Internet security firm and a law firm to take a \"hard look\" at the incident and find out what happened, though he suggested he doesn't want to make a federal case out of it. He said somebody is just trying to distract him.\n \"I know for a fact that my account was hacked,\" Weiner told Fox News. \"I can definitively say that I did not send this.\"\n He also said he \"certainly\" does not know the college student the image was sent to -- though, when asked repeatedly, Weiner declined to say whether he was shown in the image.\n The New York Democrat, who is known for his combative style in interviews and on the House floor, granted a series of TV interviews after getting testy with reporters late Tuesday.\n At the time, he repeatedly said he would not allow the incident to distract him from his job, as he likened what he described as a \"prank\" to somebody shouting out an insult or throwing a pie during a speech.\n Asked point-blank, \"Is that picture you?\" Weiner replied, \"You know I'm not going to talk about this anymore.\"\n \"This is the tactic. The guy in the back of the room who's throwing the pie or yelling out the insult wants that to be the conversation,\" Weiner told reporters. \"But I am not going to allow this thing to dominate what I talk about.\"\n As reporters continued to ask him for several minutes whether he sent the image, the exchange became heated. At one point, Weiner referred to a reporter in the scrum as a \"jackass.\"\n Weiner referred to prior statements his office had put out, indicating he was through talking about the matter.\n Though Weiner's office had earlier responded to media inquiries, a few details appear to be keeping the story alive.\n Weiner's office initially said the congressman's account was \"obviously hacked,\" but the representative has since taken to calling the incident a \"prank\" -- he used both terms Wednesday.\n The U.S. Capitol Police so far have not opened an investigation into the matter.\n A former Justice Department computer crimes prosecutor said it would not cost much to request an investigation from the FBI. The former official said if Weiner had called the FBI when the story broke, the public would already know where the Tweet originated. Though Weiner said the incident did not constitute a federal crime, the former official said multiple federal crimes would have been committed if somebody did hack into his account -- and it could lead to years behind bars.\n Amid the controversy, a Twitter official emailed security tips to members of Congress regarding their accounts.\n \"While we won't comment on individual accounts, news reports of the past few days are a good reminder of the importance of actively protecting your account credentials,\" Twitter's Adam Sharp wrote.\n He urged offices to use a \"strong password\" of at least 10 characters including numbers and symbols, be on the lookout for \"suspicious links,\" and refrain from giving out passwords to \"untrusted third-parties.\"\n The photo in question showed a close-up shot of a man's bulging underwear. It was deleted within minutes of being sent. Breitbart's BigGovernment.com first reported that it was tweeted to a Seattle woman, later identified as Gennette Cordova.\n Cordova is just one of 198 people that Weiner follows on Twitter, though he has nearly 50,000 followers. Porn star Ginger Lee tweeted last month that she received a direct message from Weiner, and several other attractive women say they've been surprised to get a \"follow\" or a message from the prominent Democrat. Those claims are all circumstantial, but it doesn't help his case should there ever actually be one.\n Weiner, 46, is married to Huma Abedin, an aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n",

However, they did read the 21st Amendment, which repealed prohibition in 1933 and is still in force.\n Republicans also left out the part about counting slaves and Native Americans as three-fifths of a person.\n Portions of the U.S. Constitution are never deleted, just amended, as has been done 27 times in history. But all the original decisions remain in the Constitution, including in the copies authorized by Congress' Joint Committee on Printing and used in Thursday's reading.\n And that was the point of contention for Democratic lawmakers who complained that exempting parts of the document from the reading undermines the objective of the exercise.\n \"This is very emotional for me,\" Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., said on the floor before the reading began.\n \"Given the struggle of African Americans, given the struggle of women, given the struggle of others to create a more perfect document, to hear that those elements of the Constitution that have been dedacted (sic) by amendment are no less serious, no less part of our ongoing struggle to improve the country and our desire to continue to improve the Constitution, many of us don't want that to be lost upon the reading of our sacred document,\" he said.\n Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., commented that the original document has been changed through amendment, leaving the the reader to interpret the operative language.\n \"I think it would be helpful to the members if you would explain to us how the determinations of what to read has been made or not made so that we all be on the same page as to congressional intent,\" he said to Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., who presided over the reading.\n Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., questioned the reading of the \"amended\" Constitution.\n \"To not read the full document, including all the text that was later amended, is to fail to acknowledge the struggle our nation has constantly fought, within and without, to 'keep' our Republic,\" he said in a written statement.\n \"It is a failure to show Americans that while we seek a more perfect union, we do so from imperfect beginnings, through an imperfect history, with an imperfect government created by an imperfect document,\" he added. \"We fail to show the American people that imperfection is not to be feared and that our ability to constantly improve on what the Founders gave us is a blessing, not a reason for divisiveness.\"\n Other lawmakers decried the exercise altogether, saying the Constitution is a living document that shouldn't be followed to the letter.\n \"They are reading it like a sacred text,\" Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the former chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, told The Washington Post.\n Nadler derided what he called the \"ritualistic reading\" as \"total nonsense\" and \"propaganda\" intended to give Republicans claim to the document. He argued that the Founders were not \"demigods\" and that the document's needs for amendments to abolish slavery and other injustices showed it was \"highly imperfect.\"\n \"You are not supposed to worship your Constitution,\" he told the newspaper. \"You are supposed to govern your government by it.\"\n But for all those who described the exercise as political waste -- including Vanity Fair magazine, which estimated it as costing more than $1 million -- supporters noted that it was an historic moment -- the first time the U.S. Constitution had been read on the U.S. House floor.\n \"I think that this is a very symbolic showing to the American people and reminder to the members of congress that we are a government of laws not of men and that this Constitution is the foundation for all of our laws,\" Goodlatte said.\n And backers said that it wouldn't hurt to try to live by the aspirations of the Founding Fathers.\n \"I don't think the Constitution is propaganda. I think it's a valuable exercise and an important moment in this Congress for us to read the Constitution,\" said Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y. \"But I do think that you can't just read it like a speech and then leave skid marks on it in your legislative record.\"\n Historian Alan Brinkley of Columbia University told Fox News the reading may be \"a bit of theater,\" but it is \"not insignificant given that many Republicans have decided -- implausibly, in my opinion -- that the Constitution is the vehicle that can reduce the size of government.\"\n But Roger Pilon of the Cato Institute said Congress needs to re-read the Constitution to be reminded how out of control government has become.\n \"Today the Congress regulates our lives and redistributes our wealth in ways that would shock the Founders,\" he said. \"The Constitution, they wrote that to ensure limited government and they meant for most of us to live our lives free from government, in the private sector, planning and living our own lives, not as dependents on government goods and services.\"\n Pilon added that the Founders never intended for the Constitution to be viewed as fluid advice.\n \"When liberals tell today that the Constitution is essentially a blank slate to be filled by transient majorities, nothing could be further from the truth. If that were so, it would never have been ratified in the first place,\" he said.\n As the Constitution was being read inside the lower chamber, Nadler and others gathered outside the Capitol to push for passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, a perennial effort to update the document with a statement on women.\n \"John Boehner and his cronies are holding up the U.S. Constitution as a sacred, perfect document. But we know the Constitution is far from perfect because it does not guarantee women's equality,\" NOW President Terry O'Neill said in a statement.\n",

Trump said when he started seriously considering a presidential bid a few weeks back, he thought the president was native-born, but now he's not so sure.\n \"His grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya, and she was there and witnessed the birth. He doesn't have a birth certificate or he hasn't shown it. He has what's called a certificate of live birth. That is something that's easy to get,\" Trump said, arguing that Obama has spent $2 million in legal fees \"to get away from this issue.\"\n Calling it potentially one of the biggest scams in the history of politics, Trump said he'd like Obama to show his birth certificate.\n \"And to be honest with you, I hope he can,\" he told \"Today.\"\n Trump, who placed second in an NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll of potential 2012 Republican candidates, said he will decide by June whether to run, and if he is the GOP nominee, \"I'd like to beat him straight up,\" not on the basis of the question of where Obama was born.\n In the poll, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney leads the would-be group of contenders with 21 percent of Republican primary voters surveyed followed by Trump and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee at 17 percent each. The Republican primary poll was taken as part of a March 31-April 4 survey of 1,000 adults, but the sample survey of Republican primary voters polled was only 238.\n In the poll, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich garnered 11 percent, while former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin earned 10 percent support. Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty earned 6 percent, Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann got 5 percent, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum won 3 percent and Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour received 1 percent support.\n Asked in the interview how genuine his presidential ambition is, Trump, who would have to hand over the reins of his international empire in order to run the country, said, \"I always take things seriously, but I've never taken it seriously like this. I wish I didn't have to do it.\"\n But speaking on ABC News, New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie, who is insistent he personally is not a candidate for president in 2012, said he wasn't sure his friend Trump would be either.\n \"Donald's a really good friend of mine, I don't know that Donald really wants to be president,\" Christie said in an interview that aired Wednesday night. Christie: I don't know that he wants that in particular. ... We've spoken about it and all I could say to you is, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll believe it when I see it.\"\n Back on NBC, Trump said he wants Obama to do well, but the presidency is not going that direction.\n \"I love this country, but this country is going to hell. ... The world laughs at us. They won't be laughing if I'm elected president,\" he said.\n Trump accused Obama of conducting a confusing policy on the civil war in Libya, saying \"nobody knows what's happening, and now it looks like (Libyan strongman Muammar) al-Qaddafi is going to beat the United States.\"\n \"I'm only interested in Libya if we get the oil,\" Trump said. He said Obama \"doesn't have a doctrine (on foreign affairs.) Foreign affairs is, we take care of ourselves first.\"\n",

Billions of dollars are at stake if it is allowed to go forward.\n The case also could affect the future of other class-action lawsuits that pool modest individual claims into a single action that creates the potential for a large judgment and increases the pressure on businesses to settle.\n In Tuesday's arguments, several justices suggested they were troubled by the case and lower court decisions against Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart. Estimates of how many women could be included in the lawsuit run from 500,000 to 1.6 million.\n Justice Anthony Kennedy, often a key vote on the high court, said the women's argument points in apparently conflicting directions.\n \"You said this is a culture where Arkansas knows, the headquarters knows, everything that's going on,\" Kennedy said to Joseph Sellers, the women's lawyer. \"Then in the next breath, you say, well, now these supervisors have too much discretion. It seems to me there's an inconsistency there, and I'm just not sure what the unlawful policy is.\"\n Sellers said that lower courts had been persuaded by statistical and other evidence put forth so far in the lawsuit. He said Wal-Mart's strong corporate culture stereotypes women as less aggressive than men and that translates into individual pay and promotion decisions at the more than 4,300 Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores across the country.\n \"The decisions are informed by the values the company provides,\" Sellers said.\n Justice Antonin Scalia said he felt \"whipsawed\" by Sellers' description. \"Well, which is it?\" Scalia asked. Either individual managers are on their own, \"or else a strong corporate culture tells them what to do.\"\n Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that at this stage of the lawsuit, the issue is not proving discrimination but showing enough evidence to go forward. \"We're talking about getting a foot in the door,\" Ginsburg said, a standard she called not hard to meet.\n Ginsburg, who made her name as a lawyer by bringing discrimination claims, said it was possible that Wal-Mart could refute the claims at a trial.\n The court's other two female justices, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, and Justice Stephen Breyer also appeared inclined to allow the lawsuit to proceed.\n But several of their more conservative colleagues appeared to agree with Theodore Boutrous Jr., representing Wal-Mart, that even subjecting the company to a trial would be unfair.\n That split among the justices raised the prospect of an ideologically divided ruling by the court this summer.\n Boutrous said the class-action nature of the case deprives the company of its legal rights because it is being forced to defend the treatment of female employees regardless of the jobs they hold or where they work.\n \"There is absolutely no way there can be a fair process here,\" Boutrous said.\n He pointed to a group of at least 544 women who serve as store managers who \"are alleged to be both discriminators and victims.\"\n Two of the named plaintiffs, Christine Kwapnoski and Betty Dukes, attended the argument. Kwapnoski is an assistant manager at a Sam's Club in Concord, Calif. Dukes is a greeter at the Wal-Mart in Pittsburg, Calif.\n Their situations were discussed only briefly, with Boutrous noting how different they were as a way to argue they should not be dealt with in the same lawsuit.\n Business interests have lined up with Wal-Mart while civil rights, women's and consumer groups have sided with the women plaintiffs.\n Both sides have painted the case as extremely consequential. The business community has said that a ruling for the women would lead to a flood of class-action lawsuits based on vague evidence. Supporters of the women say that if the court sides with Wal-Mart, it could remove a valuable weapon for fighting all sorts of discrimination.\n David Sanford, who represents plaintiffs in other class-action cases, said after the arguments that the court seemed inclined to rule against the Wal-Mart women. Sanford said such a decision could \"have implications for class actions more generally, making it more difficult for women and minority groups to enjoy equality and fair treatment in the workplace.\"\n The Obama administration is not taking part in the case, although it was lobbied by both sides.\n",

Perry. \"I am honored to have Sheriff Arpaio's support for my presidential campaign and our shared goals of fighting border crime with more personnel, border fencing and surveillance. A secure border is vital to protecting America's national security, public safety and jobs.\"\n The endorsement from Arpaio could prove helpful to Perry who has faced criticism about his stance on immigration from the Right for his support of DREAM children.\n The illegal immigration issue has also been a hotbed for clashes between Perry and GOP presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney.\n Romney has said that Perry provided a magnet for undocumented immigrants to settle in Texas by supporting a law that allows people who are in the country unlawfully to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates.\n \"You said I don't want to build a fence,\" Romney said. \"You talk about magnets -- you put in place a magnet.\"\n Perry has also said the federal government should extend work visas permitting undocumented immigrants to move freely between the U.S. and their home countries, but stressed that he still opposes amnesty or a path to citizenship.\n \"As president, I will secure the border within a year putting thousands more federal boots on the ground, strategic fencing and aerial resources to fight border crime and make our states and nation safer,\" Perry said.\n",

Rick Perry is on the attack, claiming in a new TV ad that President Obama is waging a \"War on Religion,\" and he's the GOP candidate that can defend faith in America.\n \"I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm a Christian, but you don't need to be in the pew every Sunday to know there's something wrong in this country when gays can serve openly in the military but our kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. As President, I'll end Obama's war on religion. And I'll fight against liberal attacks on our religious heritage,\" says Perry in the new ad titled \"Strong.\"\n The ad is a state-wide buy in Iowa that starts Wednesday.\n Perry ties his faith to his conservative stands on social issues, and the campaign has zeroed in on gay marriage and social issues recently, releasing several statements laying out its argument that Obama is attacking the fundamentals social conservative believe in. The arguments range from President Obama directing the Justice Department to stop arguing for the Defense of Marriage Act, to less substantive examples like Obama leaving God out of his Thanksgiving speech this year.\n In one emailed statement, Perry stated, \"just when you thought Barack Obama couldn't get any more out of touch with America's values, AP reports his administration wants to make foreign aid decisions based on gay rights. This administration's war on traditional American values must stop. This is just the most recent example of an administration at war with people of faith in this country. Investing tax dollars promoting a lifestyle many Americas of faith find so deeply objectionable is wrong. \"Perry is referring to a presidential memorandum released by the White House, in which Obama has directed all agencies working abroad ensure U.S. diplomacy and aid programs \"promote and protect\" the rights of gays and lesbians.\n Perry is a Methodist. He has never shied away from his faith during this campaign, and in earlier appeal to key evangelical voters, he released another ad in Iowa describing himself as a \"man of faith.\"\n This latest ad \"Strong\" ends with Perry claiming, \"faith made America strong. It can make her strong again.\"\n",

He cast his decision as a way to keep his options open.\n He said later on Fox News that he's still considering an independent bid. \"I am looking at it, if the Republicans choose the wrong candidate, which is a possibility, and if the economy continues to be bad, which I think it will be,\" Trump said.\n The real estate mogul and reality TV star said he wants to make sure Republicans pick the \"right\" candidate -- he said he still plans to make an endorsement despite his threatened third-party run.\n Though the Dec. 27 debate technically is sponsored by Newsmax, Trump quickly became the face of it after he was named as moderator.\n While former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum agreed to attend early on, other Republican candidates subsequently bowed out.\n Some expressed concern that Trump, who previously flirted with a possible Republican presidential bid before shelving the idea, would not definitively rule out running as a third-party candidate.\n Trump on Tuesday specifically cited Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus' concerns about his involvement. He said he does not expect Newsmax to follow through with the debate now that he's out.\n \"We would have done very well. We would have gotten great ratings,\" Trump said, voicing his trademark confidence.\n Trump first announced his debate decision in a written statement Tuesday afternoon.\n \"It is very important to me that the right Republican candidate be chosen to defeat the failed and very destructive Obama administration, but if that Republican, in my opinion, is not the right candidate, I am not willing to give up my right to run as an independent candidate,\" he said. \"Therefore, so that there is no conflict of interest within the Republican Party, I have decided not to be the moderator of the Newsmax debate. ... I must leave all of my options open because, above all else, we must make America great again!\"\n Trump went on to praise Gingrich and Santorum for \"having the courage, conviction, and confidence\" to agree to the debate.\n",

Her eyes are open wide \u00e2\u20ac\u201d very, very wide \u00e2\u20ac\u201d focused intensely somewhere off in the distance, just a smidge too high above the camera. At the bottom of the page, floating across her torso in bold white letters, are the words \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Queen of Rage.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Many in the conservative blogosphere are not pleased.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Exactly what were the editors thinking putting this kind of a picture of a sitting congresswoman and presidential candidate on their cover?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d wrote Noel Sheppard on the conservative Web site News Busters, under the headline \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Newsweek Puts Picture of Michele Bachmann on Cover That Makes Her Look Crazy.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n A blogger on the Web site Freedom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lighthouse said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Can anyone really say with a straight face that the Mainstream Media is not totally biased against conservatives?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But even some unlikely allies have emerged to decry the cover as disrespectful.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sexist,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Terry O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill, the president of the National Organization for Women, to the news Web site the Daily Caller, which is run by the conservative commentator Tucker Carlson.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Gloria Steinem has a very simple test,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ms. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill continued. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If this were done to a man or would it ever be done to a man \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has it ever been done to a man? Surely this has never been done to a man.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Monday night, Newsweek responded to the controversy by posting an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outtakes\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d gallery on its Daily Beast Web site, showcasing other photos taken for the article. The pictures show Ms. Bachmann shaking hands with voters, standing by herself in the corner of a room and signing autographs, all with the same wide-eyed intensity as in the cover shot.\n The cover goes with an article by Lois Romano about Ms. Bachmann\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s place in the Tea Party movement and on the national stage. The article itself seems to have spawned little outrage.\n This is not the first time Newsweek has caused a stir with its cover choices. In 2009, the editors selected a photo of Sarah Palin in running shorts, which the former governor \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and many others \u00e2\u20ac\u201d called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sexist.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Just this past June, the news magazine ran a computer generated image of Catherine, the new Duchess of Cambridge, walking alongside Princess Diana, who has been dead for nearly 14 years.\n The Atlantic Wire ran a story about that cover called, simply, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How Creepy Is Princess Diana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ghost on the Cover of Newsweek?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

You've had legislation reaffirming that 'In God We Trust' is our motto. That's not putting people back to work. I trust in God, but God wants to see us help ourselves by putting people back to work.\"\n On Wednesday, the House voted 396-9 on a bill that reaffirmed the motto and encouraged its display in all public schools and government buildings.\n The bill's sponsor, Rep. Randy Forbes (R-Va.) had argued that some people, including Obama, needed to be reminded of the motto.\n \"Almost a year ago, the president in making a speech across the world said that our national motto was 'E pluribus unum,'\" Forbes said. \"When the [U.S. Capitol] Visitor Center was opened ... they did not have the national motto in there. In fact, they inscribed in the stones that our national motto was 'E pluribus unum.'\"\n In a speech in Jakarta last year, Obama remarked that the American \"motto is E pluribus unum -- out of many, one.\" Officially, this wasn't correct. Minnesota congresswoman and now-GOP presidential candidate Michele Bachmann and other members of the Congressional Prayer Caucus piled on weeks later, penning a letter to Obama chastising him for his alleged failure to the use the word \"God\" and \"Creator\" more in his public speeches, especially abroad.\n",

Others appeared worried about the consequences for other businesses of a ruling that would allow the case against Wal-Mart to go forward.\n The mere certification of a class-action suit can prompt defendants to settle in light of the sums at stake, and the justices struggled to find a way to distinguish between gaps in pay that might have benign explanations and those caused by unlawful discrimination.\n The court of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has recently issued a series of rulings in favor of plaintiffs suing for employment discrimination that cut against the court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pro-business reputation. The Wal-Mart case dwarfs those rulings in importance. It is the largest employment discrimination class action in history, and the court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision, expected by June, will probably be its most important business ruling this term.\n The issue before the justices at Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arguments was not whether Wal-Mart, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest retailer and biggest private employer, discriminated against women who worked there. For now, the question in the case, Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes, No. 10-277, is whether hundreds of thousands of female workers have enough in common to join together in a single lawsuit.\n The plaintiffs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 theory is that a centralized companywide policy gave local managers too much discretion in pay and promotion decisions, leaving Wal-Mart vulnerable to gender stereotypes. The plaintiffs have presented sworn statements and statistics to support their claim.\n Wal-Mart calls that evidence unrepresentative and unreliable. The company says its policies expressly bar discrimination and promote diversity. In any event, the company says, the plaintiffs \u00e2\u20ac\u201d who worked in 3,400 stores in 170 job classifications \u00e2\u20ac\u201d do not have enough in common to warrant class-action treatment.\n Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said the theory about how the company discriminated \u00e2\u20ac\u201d through a central policy conferring local discretion \u00e2\u20ac\u201d was internally inconsistent. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Your complaint faces in two directions,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he told a lawyer for the plaintiffs.\n But Justice Stephen G. Breyer said Wal-Mart could be held accountable if it failed to take action in the face of reports of discrimination from its stores. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Should central management under the law have withdrawn some of the subjective discretion in order to stop these results?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Justice Breyer asked.\n Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed, saying that companies had a responsibility to make sure that women were treated fairly in local workplaces. And Justice Elena Kagan said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excessive subjectivity\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d may be a policy that violates the civil rights laws.\n But Justice Antonin Scalia was unconvinced.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m getting whipsawed here,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he told the plaintiffs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lawyer, Joseph M. Sellers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On the one hand, you say the problem is that they were utterly subjective, and on the other hand you say there is strong corporate culture that guides all of this. Well, which is it?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Sellers responded that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there is this broad discretion given the managers\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d but that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they do not make their decisions in a vacuum.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Managers, he went on, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153are informed by the company about how to exercise that discretion.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n That did not satisfy Justice Scalia. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If somebody tells you how to exercise discretion,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have discretion.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer for Wal-Mart, said the handful of women named as plaintiffs who seek to represent the entire class did not have typical experiences at the company.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Each of the plaintiffs have very different stories,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of them was promoted into a managerial position. One was terminated for disciplinary violations. One was promoted and then had a disciplinary problem and then was demoted.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He added that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this class includes at least 544 store managers who are alleged to be discriminators and victims.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Several justices had practical concerns.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What seems to me a very serious problem in this case is, how do you work out the back pay?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Justice Ginsburg asked.\n Mr. Sellers said the trial court could rely on statistics culled from company databases, which he said were more reliable than the evidence that might be presented in individualized hearings given the available information about particular pay and promotion decisions. Memories have faded, he said, and Wal-Mart did not keep good records.\n Given that, Mr. Sellers said, Wal-Mart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personnel decisions were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153standardless\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153recordless.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Justice Kennedy responded with a point about the suitability of the case for class-action treatment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standardless and recordless,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153then why is there commonality?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Boutrous said Mr. Sellers was trying to have it both ways.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The problem here, Mr. Sellers says, is that the records are not available,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Boutrous said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Then he says we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to have a proceeding where the district judge relies only on the records that he says are inadequate, to allow a reconstruction of the decision. That is not a process known to our jurisprudence. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comport with due process.\n Several justices voiced concerns about how many companies could be subject to class-action suits if they allowed the case against Wal-Mart to go forward.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is it true,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Chief Justice Roberts asked Mr. Sellers, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that Wal-Mart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay disparity across the company was less than the national average?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Sellers said that was not the appropriate comparison. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The comparison that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relevant,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is between men and women and Wal-Mart.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d He added later that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wal-Mart was behind the other large retailers.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The chief justice also asked Mr. Sellers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153how many examples of abuse of the subjective discrimination delegation need to be shown before you can say that flows from the policy rather than from bad actors?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d After all, he said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to have some bad apples\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d given Wal-Mart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thousands of stores.\n Mr. Sellers responded that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there is no minimum number\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d in court decisions.\n Justices Kennedy and Samuel A. Alito Jr. said they were concerned about companies whose pay and promotion gaps mirror national numbers where there is no proof of a discriminatory policy.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So, you have the company that is absolutely typical of the entire American work force,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Justice Alito said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Then you would say every single company is in violation of Title VII\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d of the Civil Rights Act?\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That could very well be the case,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Sellers said.\n",

He is famous for pushing worksite raids and creating a \"Tent City,\" a military-style holding ground for inmates, now in its eighteenth year.\n His endorsement of Perry comes after the candidate was criticized for his immigration platform, which rests on the idea that deportation of all 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country is impractical and unlikely. Perry also opposes a full border fence, although he calls for more enforcement along the southwest border with Mexico.\n \"The federal government has failed on border crime and border enforcement, and no candidate for president has done more to secure the border than Governor Rick Perry,\" Arpaio said in a statement. \"I have been watching Governor Perry and Texas closely and know his border surge operations with state, local and federal law enforcement officials have helped shut down the illegal trafficking of weapons, drugs and people. I'm endorsing Rick Perry because we need a tough-on-crime president who will champion and fund full-time border security operations from Brownsville to San Diego. Governor Perry has a superior border security record and plan to make our border and our nation safer.\"\n Perry said in a statement that if elected president, he would \"secure the border within a year.\" As Texas governor, he directed funds to enforcement along the border and requested more National Guard troops from President Barack Obama.\n \"Sheriff Arpaio knows the struggle border states face as Washington politicians and bureaucrats fail time and again to properly secure our nation's southern boundary with Mexico,\" Perry said in a statement. \"I am honored to have Sheriff Arpaio's support for my presidential campaign and our shared goals of fighting border crime with more personnel, border fencing and surveillance. A secure border is vital to protecting America's national security, public safety and jobs. As president, I will secure the border within a year putting thousands more federal boots on the ground, strategic fencing and aerial resources to fight border crime and make our states and nation safer.\"\n Arpaio endorsed Mitt Romney in 2008, choosing him over eventual nominee and fellow Arizonan John McCain. He held a joint press conference with Herman Cain in October after the two met to discuss immigration enforcement.\n",

Boehner, the newly installed speaker of the House, read the preamble (that magical \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We the people\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d), before yielding to the woman who handed him the gavel on Wednesday, Representative Nancy Pelosi, who picked up with Article 1, Section 1 (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d), followed by Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, and other House leaders.\n From there, members who wished to read were recognized from their seats, beginning with Representative Steve Rothman, Democrat of New Jersey. And so, sentence by sentence, in accents that reflect the myriad districts that did not even exist when the document came into being, by women and African Americans whose full rights were not recognized at that time, the constitutional language fluttered through the chamber.\n At one point, there was yelling in the chamber, and the sergeant-at-arms was called to remove a protester.\n The reading of the document on the floor of the House, an act that is part of the new rules package, serves several purposes, said Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, who came up with the idea for the live reading. Largely, it was meant to instruct members, who now must use it to underlie their bills, and to inform voters.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Throughout the last year there has been a great debate about the expansion of the federal government, and lots of my constituents have said that Congress has gone beyond its powers granted in the Constitution,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Mr. Goodlatte, a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over constitutional amendments. He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it is important that we send a message to people at home that the constitution is an important document.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But it was also clearly meant as a nod to the Tea Party, a loosely organized political movement whose members cite the Constitution as the basis for much of their political theory concerning federal powers and the rights and responsibilities of Congress. To wit, the document reading happened on the same day that House Republicans began the contentious process of repealing the health care law, which they have long said lacks constitutional basis.\n The order of reading was ironed out at the last minute, with the goal of letting all who wished to read do so, but making sure there was party parity, Mr. Goodlatte said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have spread the word to everyone, and there was a lot of interest,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n According to the Office of the Historian of the House of Representatives, the only two prior instances in which a full or partial text of the Constitution was inserted into the Congressional Record was in 1882, when Roswell Flower of New York \u00e2\u20ac\u0153appended\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d a text of the Constitution \u00e2\u20ac\u201d minus the amendments \u00e2\u20ac\u201d into the record, and in 1915, when Thomas Reilly of Connecticut inserted the full text of the Constitution into the Congressional Record as an extension of his remarks. But the office could not find any examples of the full text of the Constitution actually being read out loud on the House Floor.\n",

And I think the point the president is making is that, you know, we should -- we have it within our capacity to do the things to help the American people. And that's why he's working so hard to get Congress to take action on the American Jobs Act and the provisions therein,\" Carney told reporters at his daily briefing. The phrase quoted by Carney is not in the Bible, though it is often mistaken as a verse.\n Later when the official White House briefing transcript was released, there was an asterik, to Carney's statement, \"* This common phrase does not appear in the Bible,\" it read.\n Carney said the particular reference by the president to God was made in the context of \"inaction by the House of Representatives, which has spent time on issues like commemorative Hall-of-Fame baseball coins and reaffirming a motto that I don't think anyone doubted, is that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIn God We Trust' is our motto. So his point was simply that the House should get busy with matters of great importance to the United States and to the American people.\"\n During his remarks, the president also called out House Speaker John Boehner for what the administration has made a drumbeat over the last week -- a do-nothing Congress.\n \"What have you guys been debating, John? You've been debating a commemorative coin for baseball?\" Obama said. The House resolution on the national motto passed Tuesday was introduced by Rep. Randy Forbes, R-Va., and considered under an expedited floor procedure. It passed in a 396-9 vote.\n After the vote, Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., one of the nine lawmakers to vote against the resolution, said the nation faces bigger problems, such as the economy, failing public schools and poverty.\n \"Instead of facing these challenges and creating jobs to help American people make sure they have a roof over their head and food on their table, we are debating whether or not to affirm and proliferate a motto that was adopted in 1956 and is under no threat of attack,\" he said.\n House Republicans have argued that the procedural votes don't take up very much time. They add that they have brought up 15 bills that they contend will help create jobs but have been ignored in the Democratic-led Senate. The Senate is preparing to take up a portion of the president's jobs bill - on infrastructure -- after the $447 billion jobs package failed when offered as a whole.\n Carney contended that Congress wouldn't be focused at all on jobs if not for the president's power of persuasion.\n \"If not for the president's insistence on pushing the American Jobs Act, would we be having a debate about jobs and the economy right now in Washington or would Congress be -- or the Republicans in Congress be so divorced from the reality that Americans are encountering every day that they would be debating matters wholly unrelated to the primary concerns of the American people? I think that's possible. I mean, I know that Democrats would be out there pushing this, and certainly the president is,\" he said.\n",

The House GOP will reportedly make it a requirement that all new bills put forth in the legislative body include \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a statement by the lawmaker who wrote it citing the constitutional authority to enact the proposed legislation.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The Washington Post reported last week that reading the founding document in full appears to be a first in the chamber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 221-year history:\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Call it the tea party-ization of Congress. ... These are two standout changes on a long list of new rules Republicans will institute in the House when they assume the majority on Jan. 5. After handing out pocket-size Constitutions at rallies, after studying the document article by article and after demanding that Washington return to its founding principles, tea party activists have something new to applaud. A pillar of their grass-roots movement will become a staple in the bureaucracy that governs Congress.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Politics Daily recently reported:\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beyond its symbolic power, however, it is unclear what impact the new rule will have upon the nation. Under axiomatic legal precedent, virtually all congressional action is presumed valid anyway, at least initially. Moreover, by taking their oaths of office, lawmakers swear to abide by the Constitution, and virtually all legislation is vetted for constitutional support on some level by government lawyers before it makes it to committee or to the floor of the House. It is also quite obvious, from 223 years of legal and political debate on the topic, that the text of the Constitution itself, including those portions that deal with legislative power, is susceptible to many different (and often evolving) views and interpretations, a practical reality that would likely render most \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Constitutional Authority Statements\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d controversial and contentious.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n According to Peter Keating at Vanity Fair, $1.1 million is the estimated cost of GOP plans to read the document on the House floor.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The amount I get is nearly $1.1 million. $1,071,872.87, to be exact, though of course this is more back-of-the-envelope than exact. When one chamber of Congress is in session but not working, we the people still have to pay for members\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 salaries and expenses, and for their police protection, and for keeping their lights and phones and coffee machines on.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We always hear members of Congress talking about swearing an oath to represent their constituents, when in reality the only oath we take is to the Constitution,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d explained newly-minted Speaker John Boehner to the Post.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On November 2nd, voters called for an end to reckless spending and a renewed commitment to the Constitution,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), who has emerged a prominent voice of the Tea Party movement, to the Post. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These new rules show that Republicans are serious about respecting the Constitution.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Also on Thursday, the House is to take up its first spending cut measure, a proposed 5 percent trim in the budgets of leadership, rank-and-file member and committee offices. Republicans have estimated that this will save $35 million over the next nine months.\n",

Boehner of Ohio said on Monday that Republicans had a one-in-three chance of losing control of the House in November, a surprisingly downbeat assessment from a Republican leader who until now has expressed no fears of losing the gavel.\n In an interview with Fox News, to be shown on Tuesday, Mr. Boehner delivered what aides called a wake-up call to his troops.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would say that there is a two-in-three chance that we win control of the House again, but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a one-in-three chance that we could lose, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m being myself, frank,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said in an interview first posted online by the newspaper The Hill. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a big challenge, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got work to do.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Boehner pointed to what aides called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153orphan districts\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d in Democratic-leaning states that would not be a factor in the presidential campaign. Local Republican Party affiliates are less organized in such states and turnout may be depressed.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have 50 of our members in tough races, 89 freshmen running for their first re-elections, and we have 32 districts that are in states where there is no presidential campaign going to be run, no big Senate race,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You take 18 of them, California, Illinois and New York, where you know we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not likely to do well at the top of the ticket, and those districts are frankly pretty vulnerable.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n House political analysts also have looked at such states, but redistricting in California \u00e2\u20ac\u201c run by an independent commission \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has been as tough on Democrats as it has been on Republicans. Illinois and New York could be a problem for Mr. Boehner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s party, but Republican-run redistricting in North Carolina and Indiana would appear to counter those Democratic gains.\n But Democrats have become bolder on their predictions. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll last week found that voters favored a Democratic-controlled Congress over a Republican one 46 percent to 41 percent, a spread that has not changed much all year.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a real challenge,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Boehner said.\n",

Todd Akin (R-Mo.) to drop out of the U.S. Senate race in Missouri.\n \"As I said yesterday, Todd Akin's comments were offensive and wrong and he should very seriously consider what course would be in the best interest of our country,\" said Romney in a statement. \"Today, his fellow Missourians urged him to step aside, and I think he should accept their counsel and exit the Senate race.\"\n Akin, however, continued his refusal to step down Tuesday in a subsequent interview on Sean Hannity's radio show.\n \"It still seems to me that there has to be room \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 to broaden the scope of what a campaign needs to be about,\" he said, going on to suggest Romney had made a bigger deal of the remark than he needed to.\n \"Why can't Mitt Romney run his race and I'll run mine?\" Akin continued.\n He later confirmed that vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan called him and told him to \"give some thought to stepping down,\" but didn't tell him to get out.\n Akin also claimed he would help Romney and the Republican party in November by soldiering on, but admitted that no senator had called him to ask him to stay in the race.\n On Sunday, Akin prompted outrage with his response to a question about supporting abortion in the case of rape.\n \"From what I understand from doctors, that's really rare,\" said Akin said of pregnancies caused by rape. \"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. But let's assume maybe that didn't work or something. I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist.\"\n Romney had stopped short of calling on Akin to resign in an interview with WMUR Monday.\n Other officials in the GOP, including five senior Missouri Republicans, were less forgiving, however, suggesting that Akin had created an irreversible distraction and could no longer run as a viable candidate.\n Akin had also vowed to remain in the race earlier Tuesday on the radio show of former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee. During the interview, Akin said he would continue campaigning because he still believed he could win.\n",

We've got a big challenge, and we've got work to do.\"\n Democrats face an uphill battle in their efforts to take back the House, where Republicans hold a 242-190 seat advantage.\n And control of the Senate could be up for grabs this year, too, with Democrats clinging to a fragile six-vote majority. The oddsmakers who track congressional races with obsessive dedication project a handful of pickups for Republicans in the Senate -- but not necessarily enough to get to 51.\n In the House, a flurry of redistricting decisions appears to be working as of late in the Democrats' favor, though the chaotic process has stung both parties repeatedly.\n The Democrats would need 25 seats in the House to regain the majority -- a very steep climb in a year when neither party is particularly popular. However, Democrats are thought to have far more safe seats than Republicans going into November. Earlier this year, the Rothenberg Political Report projected a Democratic pick-up of between five and 12 seats.\n In total, 33 Senate seats are in play this year, with 23 currently held by Democrats and 10 held by Republicans. Ten of those 33 seats are open -- again, the state of play is in the Republicans' favor, with seven held by Democrats and three held by Republicans.\n But while Republicans have several opportunities to pick off those Democrat-held seats, three races in particular could undermine those potential gains for the GOP. Republican Sens. Scott Brown in Massachusetts and Dean Heller in Nevada, who was appointed to fill the vacancy left by John Ensign, are both considered vulnerable. And Sen. Olympia Snowe, a Republican from Maine, said she wouldn't seek re-election this year.\n",

Ryan, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, has been excoriated by some Roman Catholic leaders ever since he claimed this month that his budget plan, which slashes antipoverty programs, was inspired by the moral teachings of his Catholic faith.\n The latest criticism comes in a letter released Tuesday and signed by nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown, the Jesuit university in Washington, in advance of Mr. Ryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit there on Thursday. Mr. Ryan is to deliver the prestigious Whittington Lecture, named for an associate dean who was killed on the airplane that crashed into the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001.\n The letter says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We would be remiss in our duty to you and our students if we did not challenge your continuing misuse of Catholic teaching to defend a budget plan that decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Your budget appears to reflect the values of your favorite philosopher, Ayn Rand, rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d says the letter, which the faculty members sent to Mr. Ryan along with a copy of the Vatican\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church \u00e2\u20ac\u201d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to help deepen your understanding of Catholic social teaching.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The pressure on Mr. Ryan is part of an effort by some Catholic leaders who are political independents, liberals and Democrats to make it clear that the Catholic church is not an arm of the Republican Party. In the last year, Catholic bishops have emerged as vocal critics of the Obama administration over what they regard as violations of religious freedom, in particular the mandate that even religious employers must provide health insurance that covers birth control.\n Their condemnation has grown so heated that this month, Bishop Daniel Jenky, of Peoria, Ill., said in a homily that President Obama was so intolerant of religion that he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153following a similar path\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d as Hitler and Stalin. Dozens of faculty members at Notre Dame, also a Catholic university, sent a letter to the president and chairman of the board of trustees last Friday asking them to rebuke Bishop Jenky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments and seek his resignation from the board. Bishop Jenky has stood by his comments.\n The budget authored by Mr. Ryan, a rising star among conservatives, has given Catholic leaders an opportunity to distance the church from the Republican Party. In an interview this month on the Christian Broadcasting Network, Mr. Ryan claimed that his budget was consistent with Catholic moral teaching because it pushes the poor to become independent of government assistance.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The preferential option for the poor, which is one of the primary tenants of Catholic social teaching, means don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep people poor, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make people dependent on government so that they stay stuck at their station in life, help people get out of poverty out onto life of independence,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n The letter released Tuesday by the faculty at Georgetown took Mr. Ryan to task for that argument, saying that Catholic teaching calls for government to step in and help when communities \u00e2\u20ac\u0153face problems beyond their means to address, such as economic crises, high unemployment, endemic poverty and hunger.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also issued several letters to members of Congress calling for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor. Mr. Ryan claimed in a recent interview that those letters did not speak for all bishops, but the conference responded that those letters do indeed represent the bishops\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 collective opinion.\n",

This prompted calls to boycott Chick-fil-A that were supported by the mayors of Boston and Chicago, along with plans for a same-sex kiss-in at the restaurants on Friday.\n Last weekend, Mr. Huckabee used his television and radio programs, as well as Facebook, to help organize an appreciation day for Chick-fil-A on Wednesday.\n More than 650,000 people signed up to participate, and tens of thousands \u00e2\u20ac\u0153liked\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d photos of packed restaurants that Mr. Huckabee posted on his Facebook page on Wednesday.\n Below are some of the photos shared Wednesday on Twitter from Chick-fil-A restaurants around the country.\n Representative Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota, shared a photo from her visit.\n Last week, Sarah Palin posted a photo of her visit to a Chick-fil-A in California on her Facebook page.\n Mr. Huckabee noted in regular audio updates Wednesday that Chick-fil-A did not participate in organizing the event. And there were no tweets or photos about the appreciation day on the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Facebook or Twitter accounts.\n In response to the outpouring of support for Chick-fil-A, many people used social media to share their disappointment.\n One Facebook user who lives near Austin, Tex., posted this status update:\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has been really disconcerting how many of my FB friends have stood up on the side of hate and proudly posted their photos of Chick-fil-a \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and they all have their little quotes about how they \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclove their gay friends\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but they \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t approve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of their lifestyles.\n So I am asking you kindly to please un-friend me \u00e2\u20ac\u201d I have no use for friends like you.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation has asked supporters to donate the cost of a meal at a Chick-fil-A, about $6.50, to gay and lesbian rights groups.\n Facebook users are also signing up to participate in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153National Same-Sex Kiss Day\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d planned for Friday at Chick-fil-A restaurants. People are being encouraged to post photos of their kisses.\n Others are not waiting until Friday to post their photos.\n",

But it was the vice president who set the aggressive tone, blatantly striving to hit the reset after President Obama was panned for his lackluster performance at last week's opening debate.\n If Obama was too cold, Biden at times bordered on too hot, analysts said afterward.\n He chuckled and smirked through many of Ryan's responses. But unlike Obama a week ago, he let few points go unchallenged.\n Biden went after the Romney/Ryan ticket with a directness that Obama did not. Notably, he hammered Mitt Romney over his secretly videotaped comment in which he said he doesn't have to worry about the \"47 percent\" of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes.\n \"These people are my mom and dad, the people I grew up with, my neighbors,\" Biden said, adding he's \"had it up to here\" with those kinds of comments.\n Ryan shot back, in reference to Biden's tendency to make gaffes: \"As the vice president very well knows ... sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way.\"\n \"But I always say what I mean,\" Biden responded.\n Ryan accused Obama of \"projecting weakness\" with his foreign policy, particularly in his response to the terror attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. At home, he accused the administration of presiding over a shoddy recovery.\n \"This is not what a real recovery looks like,\" Ryan said.\n Whether the debate will alter the course of the race remains to be seen. There are two more presidential debates on the calendar, and the polls have started to swing in Romney's favor. The tightening was reflected in the candidates' attitude onstage Thursday, each loath to give the other too many seconds of speech-time without a challenge.\n The economy, the budget deficit and foreign policy were central. Each candidate made frequent appeals to the middle class, Biden by pledging to protect programs in the federal budget and Ryan by pledging to grow the economy for everybody.\n Ryan opened the debate with tough criticism of the Obama administration over its handling of the Libya terror attack.\n \"What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy,\" Ryan said.\n With the moderator, ABC News' Martha Raddatz, opening the debate with a question about the Libya strike, which happened a month ago Thursday, Ryan criticized the administration for waiting more than a week after the strike to call it a coordinated terror attack.\n \"This is becoming more troubling by the day. They first blamed the YouTube video. Now they're trying to blame the Romney/Ryan ticket for making this an issue,\" he said. Ryan was referring to a claim by an Obama aide earlier Thursday that the only reason the attack had entered the political debate was because of Romney's criticism - a claim Romney rejected.\n Biden was quick to retort: \"With all due respect, that's just a bunch of malarkey. ... Not a single thing he said is accurate.\"\n He added: \"This talk about this weakness, I don't understand what my friend's talking about.\"\n Biden also criticized Romney for making a \"political statement\"on the night of the attack, a reference to Romney's criticism of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo's early response to protests there. On the question of why the administration initially claimed the attack was the result of a protest, Biden explained \"the intelligence community told us that.\"\n The face-off Thursday night was taking on outsized importance for a vice presidential debate.\n After Obama's debate performance last week, the pressure was on Biden to recapture the momentum -- while equally on Ryan to prevent the Obama ticket from blunting Romney's surge.\n Ryan referred to the weight on Biden's shoulders about mid-way through, as the two talked over each other on Medicare.\n \"Mr. vice president, I know you're under a lot of duress to make up for lost ground, but I think people would be better served if we don't keep interrupting each other,\" Ryan said.\n On Medicare, Biden charged that the Republican ticket's plan would raise costs for future seniors with a de facto \"voucher\" system. \"Their ideas are old and their ideas are bad and they eliminate the guarantee of Medicare,\" he said.\n Ryan shot back: \"They got caught with their hand in the cookie jar turning Medicare into a piggy bank for ObamaCare.\"\n The debate veered across the spectrum of topics from the campaign trail. On Iran's nuclear program, Biden repeatedly suggested Romney and Ryan would too readily choose the military option to stop it. On abortion, he cautioned that the next president will get to choose one or two justices on the Supreme Court -- \"that's how close Roe v. Wade is.\"\n Ryan, toward the end of the debate, warned that a \"debt crisis is coming\" and claimed the sitting president offers little more than speeches to address the deficit.\n \"That's what we get in this administration -- speeches. But we're not getting leadership,\" he said.\n In a matter of days, Romney has picked up steam in both battleground and national polls. The latest Fox News national poll of likely voters showed Romney edging Obama, 46 percent to 45 percent.\n Obama has acknowledged he had a \"bad night\" in his debate last week, but the campaign indicates it will be more aggressive going forward. After Biden's more feisty performance Thursday, Obama campaign manager Jim Messina quipped that he's a \"happy warrior\" for the middle class.\n The final presidential debates will be held Oct. 16 and Oct. 22. The next one will be a town hall format focusing on a range of issues, and the last one will focus exclusively on foreign policy.\n",

She called the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a huge mistake\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d that would reward the Republican Party.\n Evan Wolfson, the founder of Freedom to Marry, a gay rights organization, said that now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there is absolutely no way that opponents of gay rights can hide behind any unclarity in the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position and make the bogus claim that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same as theirs.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Romney has, over the years, made it clear that his opposition to same-sex marriage and civil unions is a deeply held moral conviction, and he has not shied from using strong language to describe the offense he has taken to its introduction.\n When in 2003 the Massachusetts courts legalized same-sex marriage in the state, Mr. Romney, then governor, complained that the state had become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153San Francisco East.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d And, speaking with a sense of alarm about gay couples, he warned a conservative audience that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some are actually having children born to them.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Democrats contend that, like Mr. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views, Mr. Romney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s feelings about gay rights have evolved, but in the opposite direction: During his campaign for the Senate in 1994, Mr. Romney vowed to seek \u00e2\u20ac\u0153full equality\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d for gays and lesbians, in a letter to the Log Cabin Republicans of Massachusetts.\n In that letter he argued that he was more supportive of gay rights than his Democratic opponent at the time, Senator Edward M. Kennedy.\n But at the time, same-sex marriage was a little-discussed item on the agenda of national gay rights leaders, and aides say Mr. Romney has consistently opposed both marriage and civil unions that resemble marriage for gay couples.\n",

Akin to drop Senate bid over 'rape' comments\n\nPUBLISHED: 2012/08/21\n\nMitt Romney joined several other Republicans Tuesday in calling on Missouri Rep. Todd Akin to give up his bid for Senate over his controversial comments on rape, as the Republican congressman continued to hold his ground and vowed to stay in the race.\n Romney added his voice after five past and present Missouri Republican senators urged Akin to step aside. In a statement released Tuesday afternoon, they said his presence does not serve \"the national interest.\"\n \"The issues at stake are too big, and this election is simply too important. The right decision is to step aside,\" they said. The statement came from Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, and former Sens. John Ashcroft, Kit Bond, John Danforth and Jim Talent\n Romney released a statement late Tuesday saying: \"As I said yesterday, Todd Akin's comments were offensive and wrong and he should very seriously consider what course would be in the best interest of our country. Today, his fellow Missourians urged him to step aside, and I think he should accept their counsel and exit the Senate race.\"\n Akin, though, told Fox News host Mike Huckabee on his radio show Tuesday afternoon that he's staying in.\n \"I believe that we can win this,\" Akin said, citing a \"tremendous outpouring of support\" from individual donors even as party heavyweights freeze him out.\n The Republican congressman is facing a 5 p.m. deadline to withdraw -- after that, he would need a court order to have his name removed from the ballot.\n But Akin rebuffed calls late Monday to step aside and let another Republican candidate take his place. Instead, his campaign released a new ad in which Akin looks into the camera and addresses the controversy surrounding his remarks.\n \"Rape is an evil act. I used the wrong words in the wrong way and for that I apologize,\" he said in the ad. \"As the father of two daughters, I want tough justice for predators. I have a compassionate heart for the victims of sexual assault. And I pray for them. The fact is, rape can lead to pregnancy. The truth is, rape has many victims.\n \"The mistake I made was in the words I said, not in the heart I hold. I ask for your forgiveness,\" he said. The video was released after Akin canceled a scheduled television interview Monday night.\n Akin's ad, and claims Monday that he's \"going to stay in,\" defied Republican Party leaders who are nervous the controversy could imperil their chances of taking control of the Senate after the November elections. Akin is challenging Democratic Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill in a race considered key to a GOP Senate majority come 2013.\n A source within the National Republican Senatorial Committee told Fox News that Sen. John Cornyn, head of the Senate GOP campaign arm, already has told Akin that if he stays in the race, the $5 million set aside for the Missouri race will be withdrawn. Cornyn, according to the source, told him the party is concerned his presence in the race could hurt Republicans' chances of winning the Senate majority.\n Akin made the remarks in an interview with Fox affiliate KTVI. He claimed a woman's body can typically fend off pregnancy during a \"legitimate rape,\" as he argued against allowing abortions in cases of rape, claiming such pregnancies are uncommon in the first place.\n \"It seems to me first of all, from what I understand from doctors, that's really rare,\" Akin told KTVI. \"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\"\n Top Senate leaders including Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell have condemned Akin's comments.\n \"What he said is just flat wrong in addition to being wildly offensive to any victim of sexual abuse,\" McConnell said. \"Although Rep. Akin has apologized, I believe he should take time with his family to consider whether this statement will prevent him from effectively representing our party in this critical election.\"\n Republican Sen. Scott Brown, who's in a tough race against Democrat Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts, was the first Republican senator to call on Akin to withdraw from the race.\n Akin apologized for his remarks Monday. He tweeted Monday afternoon: \"I am in this race to win.\"\n",

True to form, neither said much of anything about what was discussed.\n Shortly after the meeting ended, both camps put out identical, banal statements.\n \"The President and Speaker had a frank meeting in the Oval Office tonight,\" said the statements. \"It lasted approximately 50 minutes. There will be no further readout of the meeting, but lines of communication remain open.\"\n Boehner was back at the Capitol soon afterward, but said nothing new as he passed reporters eager for a readout. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nice to see all of you,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said as he kept walking, CNN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Deirdre Walsh tweeted. Boehner is heading back to Ohio for the weekend.\n A handful of others attended the meeting. Timothy Geithner, the treasury secretary, and Rob Nabors, director of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs, joined Obama, a White House aide confirmed. Boehner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief of staff, Mike Sommers, and his policy director, Brett Loper, were also in attendance.\n Thursday night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting marks the second time in a week the president and House speaker have met in person, and comes after at least two phone calls in recent days.\n The continued dialogue provides some rays of hope to a negotiating process that, in recent days, has shown very little progress. Boehner has refused to budge from his refusal to consider raising tax rates on top earners while arguing that heavy spending cuts are needed. The White House, in contrast, has accused House Republican leadership of being deliberately vague on cuts, while insisting that no deal will end up getting the president's signature without a raising of tax rates.\n With the year-end deadline for all rates to expire and $1 trillion in spending cuts to kick in, the prospect of actually failing to find agreement is coming into focus. A top Senate Democratic aide told the Huffington Post on Thursday that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) told his caucus that finalizing a deal by Christmas was now basically impossible.\n Boehner, meanwhile, told lawmakers earlier Thursday not to make plans for Christmas, signaling that there may not realistically be a final deal until the very end of the month. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say whether Obama is also bracing for dragged out negotiations\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speculate about the time frame,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Carney said at his daily briefing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What the president is interested in is working with Congress to achieve a deal that avoids the fiscal cliff and, beyond that, addresses our long-term fiscal challenges in a balanced way. He wants to makes sure, first and foremost, that the middle class does not have their taxes go up on January 1st.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Ryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget blueprint assumes the same amount of Medicare savings as President Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health care law, even though Mitt Romney and Mr. Ryan have said those cuts would be devastating to millions of older Americans on Medicare\n As the partisan brawl over Medicare continued on Tuesday and threatened to become the focus of the race, the Obama campaign said that Mr. Ryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget plan \u00e2\u20ac\u201d broadly endorsed by Mr. Romney \u00e2\u20ac\u201d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153would end Medicare as we know it\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and shift costs to beneficiaries.\n The Republicans hit back on Tuesday with a television commercial asserting that the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan was better for older Americans.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You paid into Medicare for years, every paycheck,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the advertisement says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now when you need it, Obama has cut $716 billion from Medicare. Why? To pay for Obamacare. So now the money you paid for your guaranteed health care is going to a massive new government program that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not for you.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Lis Smith, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign, said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mitt Romney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Medicare ad is dishonest and hypocritical.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d The savings, she said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do not cut a single guaranteed Medicare benefit.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Mr. Ryan said he welcomed the back and forth.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a debate we want to have,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the ones who are offering a plan to save Medicare, to protect Medicare, to strengthen Medicare.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n With 50 million beneficiaries, Medicare is a major concern for both parties. The current fight centers on changes in the program made in the new health law, the Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010 without Republican votes.\n Mr. Obama would use the savings to help offset the cost of covering the uninsured, as well as to improve the financial condition of the Medicare trust fund. Mr. Ryan says he would use the money to shore up Medicare and to help reduce budget deficits.\n Republicans won control of the House in 2010 partly by arguing that Democrats had raided Medicare to pay for Mr. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health care law. Democrats hope to deflect such attacks this year by pointing out that Mr. Ryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget plan, approved twice by the House, includes similar savings \u00e2\u20ac\u201d roughly $700 billion from 2013 to 2022, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n Those savings have a complicated history.\n Mr. Ryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget plan was approved in March by the House Budget Committee, of which he is chairman. Before the vote, committee members discussed the budget plan and the Medicare provisions in detail.\n Representative Allyson Y. Schwartz, Democrat of Pennsylvania, asked whether the savings in the Affordable Care Act \u00e2\u20ac\u201d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sometimes referred to as cuts to Medicare\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d \u00e2\u20ac\u201d were part of Mr. Ryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget.\n Austin Smythe, the panel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Republican staff director, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We assume those savings. We devote them to solvency of Medicare and to deficit reduction, instead of covering the expansions.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n At another point, Mr. Smythe said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We assume the repeal of all of the expansions in the Affordable Care Act.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Those expansions, he said, include subsidies to help low- and middle-income people buy private insurance. Democrats said that repeal of the new law would also wipe out new Medicare benefits, like additional coverage of prescription drugs and preventive services.\n The House approved the Ryan budget plan on March 29 by a vote of 228 to 191, with all but 10 Republicans voting for it.\n Mr. Romney has offered a Medicare proposal similar to Mr. Ryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. But the Romney campaign said Tuesday that Mr. Romney would restore the money being squeezed out of Medicare by the 2010 health law.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have always been fully committed to repealing Obamacare, ending President Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $716 billion raid on Medicare, and tackling the serious fiscal challenges our country faces,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Lanhee Chen, the policy director for the Romney campaign. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A Romney-Ryan administration will restore the funding to Medicare.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The Ryan plan, like any budget resolution, specifies levels of spending, savings and revenues, based on certain policy assumptions. But, as Mr. Smythe pointed out, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the committees of jurisdiction determine the details\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d in separate legislation.\n Mr. Ryan and Mr. Obama would impose similar overall constraints on Medicare spending, stipulating that average spending per beneficiary should not grow faster than the economy, measured by the per capita output of goods and services, plus one-half of one percentage point.\n However, they would achieve the goal in different ways.\n Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney would limit the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current open-ended financial commitment to Medicare. The government would contribute a fixed amount of money on behalf of each beneficiary, and future beneficiaries could use the money to buy private insurance or to help pay for coverage under the traditional Medicare program.\n The new health care law, by contrast, will reduce projected Medicare payments to health maintenance organizations, hospitals and many other health care providers. As a backstop, to ensure savings, the law creates a Medicare cost control board. Cuts recommended by the board would take effect automatically unless Congress voted to block or change them.\n Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan would abolish the panel, which they describe as a tool for rationing health care.\n",

Ryan, trying to paint his opponent as a latter-day Dan Quayle.\n Mr. Ryan was no Dan Quayle, but he did make the mistake of mentioning John F. Kennedy in an argument over whether tax cuts recharge the economy. Mr. Biden flashed a Cheshire Cat grin and said to Ryan, after waiting a beat to let the moment sink in, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So, now you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re Jack Kennedy?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The vice presidential debate on Tuesday was supposed to be a reboot for the Obama campaign after the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dismal performance at his debate with the Republican nominee for president, Mitt Romney, last week. Mr. Biden, clearly delighted to come to President Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rescue, relished his role, addressing his opponent as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153my friend\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d but dismissing his arguments as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153malarkey.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d He laughed at Mr. Ryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks so often and so heartily that at times he seemed like a guest at a comedy club roast, not a vice president debating the fate of the nation with his opponent.\n It was a sharp and spirited debate, with both candidates delivering some lacerating blows, but Mr. Ryan at times seemed disconcerted by the sheer blowhard intensity Mr. Biden brought to the night. Mr. Ryan tried to be respectful, listening to the vice president with a tilted head, choirboy smile and puppy-dog eyes, but he showed his irritation when Mr. Biden kept interrupting to attack his policy on Medicare. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I know you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re under duress,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he told the vice president, prompting another belly laugh.\n For Mr. Biden especially, the night was his chance to relive past debates and unleash his inner barroom brawler. He had to be contained and courteous when he debated Sarah Palin four years ago, lest he look like a bully. This time he let loose. And unlike the courtly Mr. Bentsen in 1988, Mr. Biden turned his temperature up, singeing the young man across the table with patronizing grins, but mostly withering retorts. His interruptive barrage was as relentless as his silent mugging for the camera.\n Mr. Ryan held his own, but did look abashed when Mr. Biden mocked him for opposing the Obama stimulus, yet asking for government funds for his own district. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On two occasions, we \u00e2\u20ac\u201d we \u00e2\u20ac\u201d we advocated for constituents who were applying for grants,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Ryan said stiffly.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I love that. I love that,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Biden said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was such a bad program, and he writes me a letter saying \u00e2\u20ac\u201d writes the Department of Energy a letter saying, the reason we need this stimulus \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it will create growth and jobs.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n When Mr. Biden went after Mr. Romney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infamous remark at a private fund-raiser about the \u00e2\u20ac\u015347 percent,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Ryan reminded the vice president of his own propensity for gaffes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come out of your mouth the right way,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said with a gotcha smile. Mr. Biden was not quite as amused.\n Mr. Biden was not the only one in the room intent on rectifying his predecessor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mistakes. Martha Raddatz of ABC News was the moderator, and she made a point of speaking forcefully, pushing the candidates to be specific and changing subjects abruptly. She seemed determined to be less passive and sleepy than Jim Lehrer of PBS was as moderator of the Obama-Romney debate.\n Mr. Ryan made a point of praising Mr. Romney, even trying to soften his image by recounting a time when Mr. Romney gave money and attention to a couple whose children were badly injured in a car accident. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the best example to use, because it prompted Mr. Biden to describe his own tragedy, when his wife and young daughter were killed in a car crash.\n A version of this article appears in print on October 12, 2012, on page A16 of the New York edition with the headline: Night of Withering Ripostes, Mostly Delivered by Biden.\n",

The group sent a letter to Rep. Ryan in advance of his appearance on the Catholic campus on Thursday morning to give the Whittington Lecture.\n In their letter to Ryan, the scholars make clear they are not objecting to his speaking on campus, but rather his recent comments defending his budget on Christian grounds.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our problem with Representative Ryan is that he claims his budget is based on Catholic social teaching,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Jesuit Father Thomas J. Reese , one of the organizers of the letter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is nonsense. As scholars, we want to join the Catholic bishops in pointing out that his budget has a devastating impact on programs for the poor.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Reese is a senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University.\n The letter quotes the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which wrote several letters to Congress saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a just framework for future budgets cannot rely on disproportionate cuts in essential services to poor persons.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d The bishops noted that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the House-passed budget resolution fails to meet these moral criteria.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Last week, Rep. Ryan dismissed the bishops\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 critique, erroneously claiming the letters didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t represent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all the bishops,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d a point the USCCB media office denied.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am afraid that Chairman Ryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget reflects the values of his favorite philosopher Ayn Rand rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Father Reese. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Survival of the fittest may be okay for Social Darwinists but not for followers of the gospel of compassion and love.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The Georgetown scholars pointed to the devastating impact of cuts in food programs that keep the poor from starvation. From personal experience, they also \u00e2\u20ac\u0153know how cuts in Pell Grants will make it difficult for low-income students to pursue their educations at colleges across the nation, including Georgetown.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The scholars corrected Mr. Ryan on his use of the Catholic concept of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153subsidiarity\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a rationale gutting government programs.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d The scholars say that it is true that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It calls for solutions to be enacted as close to the level of local communities as possible. But it also demands that higher levels of government provide help\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsubsidium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhen communities and local governments face problems beyond their means to address such as economic crises, high unemployment, endemic poverty and hunger.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The scholars also gave the Representative a reading assignment: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d which was commissioned by John Paul II and published by the Vatican.\n Signing the letter were over a dozen Georgetown Jesuit priests, numerous members of the Theology and other departments including History, Government, Philosophy, School of Foreign Service and School of Nursing & Health Studies.\n",

While the president's team has pointed to the Republican plan to turn Medicare into a quasi-voucher program -- in which recipients would receive a check to buy either insurance through the private market or traditional Medicare -- the Romney team has responded by noting that Obama took more than $700 billion out of Medicare as part of his health care overhaul.\n \"He stole $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare,\" said RNC Chair Reince Priebus. \"If any person in this entire debate has blood on their hands in regard to Medicare, it's Barack Obama.\"\n That rejoinder is now a subject of intense debate. The money being taken out of the system by the Affordable Care Act is mostly derived from limiting the expected rate of growth in the program.\n The savings come predominantly from limiting waste, fraud and abuse, mostly in Medicare Advantage, and are budgeted to help subsidize insurance for people under the ACA. As such, independent fact-checkers and news analysts alike have disputed the Romney campaign's characterization.\n Part of the reason that the Obama campaign is crying foul over this line of criticism, however, may be because it knows how effective it can be. Republicans also used the charge that Obamacare raided Medicare as a primary attack line in the 2010 congressional elections. Two years prior, then-Senator Obama used virtually identical language to beat up on his general election opponent, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.):\n \"How would your golden years turn out under John McCain? His health care plan would cut Medicare by $800 billion -- that means a 22 percent cut in benefits. Higher premiums and co-pays ... after a lifetime of work, senior's health care shouldn't be a gamble. John McCain's plan, it's not the change we need.\"\n Obama made the same argument on the stump.\n \"It turns out, Senator McCain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare: $882 billion worth -- $882 billion in Medicare cuts to pay for a ill-conceived, badly thought-through health care plan that won't provide more health care to people, even though Medicare is already facing a looming shortfall,\" Obama declared at a campaign stop in Roanoke, Va.\n Douglas Holtz-Eakin, McCain's policy director at the time, recalled that the attack originated with a Wall Street Journal article that referenced his saying that McCain would assume savings in Medicare and Medicaid spending to make his health care plan budget neutral. Those savings were expected to come from eliminating fraud and reforming payment policies. The possibility of increasing Medicare premiums for higher-income earners was also floated.\n FactCheck.org rated the Obama ad as \"false,\" noting that the McCain campaign wasn't talking about slashing benefits but limiting waste and slowing the rate of growth. Holtz-Eakin said, \"We were looking for efficiencies in delivery a la Managed Medicaid.\"\n This was a relatively minor aspect of the Obama campaign's assault on McCain's Medicare record. The more substantive criticism concerned McCain's proposal to tax worker health care plans as a way of generating money to give people a new tax credit so that they could buy private insurance.\n \"Like Governor Romney has refused to specify how he will pay for his $5 trillion tax cuts weighted toward millionaires, Senator McCain would have cut $1.3 trillion from health care programs to pay for tax cuts while refusing to rule out cutting benefits or to say what he was cutting,\" Obama's current campaign press secretary, Ben LaBolt, said in an email to The Huffington Post. \"President Obama achieved a third as much savings by eliminating unnecessary subsidies to insurances companies and getting waste and fraud out of the system in order to improve seniors' benefits -- saving them $600 a year on prescription drugs and providing them with access to preventive care. Senator McCain and Governor Romney have subsequently opposed the savings that the president identified and demagogued the issue, ironically, since Governor Romney's running mate kept them in his budget.\"\n But the attack on McCain's accounting was part of the assault nonetheless. And in light of the current debate over Medicare proposals, it could complicate the political dialogue even further. Certainly, as the Washington Examiner's Phillip Klein notes, it will contribute to the general reluctance to talk substantively about Medicare reform out of a concern that it merely invites future attacks.\n",

It's irrefutable and that's why I think this is a debate we want to have, and that's the debate we're going to win.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The comments signal Ryan and Romney are prepared to dig in and fight back, as Democrats lob charges that Ryan stands for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ending Medicare as we know it.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The Obama campaign used that line Monday in a Web video timed for Romney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrival in Florida, with its large senior population. The video pointed to Ryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget proposals, which include significant changes to Medicare.\n The Romney campaign retorted with an ad of its own Tuesday.

To pay for ObamaCare.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Ryan told Fox News the campaign is trying to show the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clear contrast\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d between what Republicans propose and what Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health care law does. Ryan wants to make changes to Medicare for those retiring a decade from now but leave benefits for current retirees and those retiring soon in place.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They turned Medicare into a piggy bank to finance ObamaCare,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ryan said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And we want to point that out. And we want to \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 restore those cuts to prevent that raid. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 And so we propose no changes to anybody in or near retirement so that the guarantee of Medicare is for them. That's a clear contrast with President Obama's plan.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The Obama campaign is disputing that argument. Obama campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith described the new Romney-Ryan ad on the subject as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dishonest and hypocritical,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d considering Ryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own proposals for Medicare.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The savings his ad attacks do not cut a single guaranteed Medicare benefit, and Mitt Romney embraced the very same savings when he promised he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d sign Paul Ryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Smith said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Because the president is eliminating subsidies to insurance companies and cutting waste and fraud, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve extended the life of Medicare by eight years. The truth is that the Romney-Ryan budget would end Medicare as we know it: people with Medicare would be left with nothing but a voucher in place of the guaranteed benefits they rely on today.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Both sides are being selective in how they describe each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans.\n The Ryan proposal, submitted again in the House earlier this year, would a decade from now give seniors government payments to purchase private plans or stay within the current system. Ryan says this is to preserve Medicare, not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153end\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d it, as Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign claims.\n But while Ryan slams the health care overhaul for cutting Medicare, even he acknowledged that his own plan achieves \u00e2\u20ac\u0153savings\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d for Medicare in the long run. Though he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cuts,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the plan would slow the rate of benefit growth for seniors according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n And the ObamaCare cuts he referenced would likely come in the form of lower payments to providers. A Romney campaign aide, though, said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a distinction without a difference\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d since the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153provider passes that reduction along to\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d patients.\n In his interview with Fox News, Ryan also hammered Obama for what he called his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153utter failure when it comes to creating jobs.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Amplifying the Romney campaign message, he said Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heavy borrowing is dragging down economic growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he also claimed the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hope and change campaign of '08 has become the blame and attack campaign of 2012.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Ryan offered new insight as well on how Romney and Ryan came to bond in the months before he was announced as running mate.\n He recalled when he was campaigning with Romney earlier this year ahead of the Wisconsin primary.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We spent about five days on the road, five working hour or so days,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And in between all of those stops, driving from, you know, Appleton to Green Bay to Janesville to Milwaukee, we got to know each other. We conversed on policy issues, on where to take the country. And sooner or later, we basically started sharing the microphones at these town hall meetings and we just kind of developed a chemistry with one another and a mutual understanding with each other.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Ryan said he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know whether he had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special place\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d but it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very clear we thought the same on these issues.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When he asked me to join the ticket, he basically said to me, 'You share my values and you have the kind of experience that could be a complement to my experience to getting this country back on track, to creating jobs, to getting people back to work, to saving this country from a debt crisis,'\" Ryan said.\n Ryan also discussed his affection for novelist Ayn Rand, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Atlas Shrugged\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d triggered his interest in economics. He said he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t share her overall philosophy but said her books \u00e2\u20ac\u0153showed how the pitfalls of socialism can hurt the economy.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Obama, meanwhile, took on Ryan for the second straight day Tuesday, using a stop in Oskaloosa, Iowa, to criticize Ryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Romney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax plan.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You may have heard that Governor Romney just chose his running mate, Congressman Ryan. He's a good man. He's a family man. He's the ideological leader of the Republicans in Congress,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Obama said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And he's an articulate spokesperson for Governor Romney's views. The problem is, those views are wrong.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

I believe marriage is between a man and a woman,\" he told reporters following an event at the Oklahoma Republican Party headquartersk, where he garnered the endorsement of Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin.\n Obama made the groundbreaking news in an interview with ABC.\n \"It is important for me personally to go ahead and affirm that same-sex couples should be able to get married,\" Obama stated. He previously had said he supported equal rights for same-sex couples but stopped short of endorsing gay marriage.\n When asked if he believed the president had flip-flopped on the issue, Romney said it's up to the public to be the judge.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I believe that based upon the interview that he gave today on ABC it said that he had changed his view, but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a better judge of that than I,\" Romney said. \"I just saw the reports that he had previously said he opposed same-sex marriage and now according to ABC News he saying that he supports it.

On Wednedsay, though, he said that the rights of domestic partners should be decided by the states.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153States are able to make decisions with regards to domestic partnership benefits such as hospital visitation rights, benefits and so forth of various kinds can be determined state by state,\" Romney said.\n Following Romney's news conference, Obama's campaign immediately pounced on the former governor's comments.\n Ben Labolt tweeted, \"@MittRomney just refused to say he supports hospital visitation rights at a federal level for gays and lesbians.\"\n",

His words are taken from a recent news conference, in which he expressed frustration at the Obama administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to establish \u00e2\u20ac\u0153red lines\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d for reining in Iran and its rogue nuclear weapons program.\n \"The fact is that every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to a nuclear bomb,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Netanyahu says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The world tells Israel, wait, there's still time. And I say wait for what? Wait until when?\"\n A voice-over at the end of the ad underscores the prime minister's message: \"The world needs American strength, not apologies.\"\n The ad, paid for by nonprofit conservative advocacy group Secure America Now, could have a powerful influence in heavily-Jewish markets, including Miami. Florida is considered a toss-up in recent polling, and its 29 electoral votes could swing the election.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sizable majorities in both states believe that Iran will share nuclear weapons with terrorists,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Jeri Thompson, advisory board member for Secure America Now. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Support for Israel remains strong. In short, (Netanyahu's) a powerful messenger with a powerful message who the American people believe.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The ad, reportedly to air in Miami, West Palm Beach and Fort Myers, is costing Secure America $1 million, the organization confirmed to Fox News.\n A Fox News poll released Wednesday shows Obama leading Romney, 49 percent to 44 percent, in Florida.\n Meanwhile, Haaretz reported that the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate $5 million TV advertising blitz aimed at Jewish voters in swing states. That campaign started Wednesday and runs through Nov. 5 in cable and broadcast TV markets in Florida, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania.\n \"This ad highlights the 'buyer's remorse' felt by many in the Jewish community, who voted for Obama four years ago but are now disillusioned with his economic policies and his policies toward Israel,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the coalition's executive director, Matt Brooks, said in a written statement Wednesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These ads, and the stories of the people in them, give voice to the nagging doubts that many Jewish voters feel about President Obama. To underscore that point, numerous polls have shown an erosion in Jewish support for the president.\"\n Netanyahu also made an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" last Sunday, urging Obama to take a tougher line with Iran over its nuclear program.\n \"President Obama has said that he is determined to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons,\" he said on the Sunday morning show. \"If you're determined to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons, it means you'll act before they get nuclear weapons.\"\n",

Now it has become a symbol of whether you stand for or against same-sex marriage, or \u00e2\u20ac\u201c alternately \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the right to express your personal views without fear of retaliation.\n At Chick-fil-A locations across the country, people voted with their wallets today, coming out to express support for the fast-food chain after CEO Dan Cathy said in an interview that he is a firm backer of traditional marriage.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I believe what the Bible says (about marriage),\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Chauncy Fields told us after wolfing down a breakfast of chicken and biscuits. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So I came out here to support Chick-fil-A and the movement.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Chris Johnson sees a double standard. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He (Dan Cathy) said the exact same thing that President Obama said,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Johnson told Fox News -- referring to the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s past opposition to gay marriage \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And he gets negativity, and Obama gets positivity.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n At one Atlanta location, the restaurant was packed, while the line for the drive-thru looped twice around the building and out into the street.\n The backlash across the country against Chick-fil-A has been ferocious. After the mayors of Chicago and Boston heaped scorn upon the company, the mayor of Washington, DC, suggested it was peddling \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hate chicken.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Those comments drew a sharp response from Rev. William Owens of the Coalition of African American Pastors. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some people are saying that because of the position that Chick-fil-A is taking, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want them in their cities. It is a disgrace. It is the same thing that happened when I was marching for civil rights, when they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a black to come into their restaurant,\" he told a press conference in Washington, DC.\n The Chick-fil-A firestorm has taken on different meanings for different people. For some, it harks to the days of intolerance and segregation. For others, it is about religious views of marriage. But for most people who Fox News spoke to today, it is about free speech.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it comes down to a First Amendment issue. I mean, I do believe in the traditional values of marriage between a man and a woman,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d youth pastor Stephen Lenahan told Fox News after a leisurely breakfast with three members of his ministry. He is also puzzled as to why Dan Cathy is such a target, when other corporate CEOs who openly support same-sex marriage are not similarly criticized by conservatives.\n Lenahan says he sees a bigger issue at work here. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is kind of a culture war going on and people aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really respecting each other and difference of opinion. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no dialogue taking place to get to the heart of what we really believe as a nation and what is truth.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it is being called was the idea of former Arkansas governor and Fox News contributor Mike Huckabee. But as protests against Chick-fil-A swelled across the country, dozens of groups and prominent individuals joined in support of the company.\n Among the groups is Project 21, a black conservative activist organization. One of its members, Demetrios Minor, said critics of Dan Cathy have taken his statements completely out of context. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think liberals are missing a vital point in their blind hatred of Chick-fil-A,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Minor said in a statement sent to Fox News. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Being against gay marriage is not being anti-gay.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Crtitics of Chick-fil-A argue that the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opposition to gay marriage goes well beyond Dan Cathy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statements. Over the years, its philanthropic wing, WinShape, has donated millions of dollars to outside organizations that actively lobby against efforts to legalize same-sex marriage.\n On Friday, supporters of same-sex marriage will have their say. They plan a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kiss-in\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d at Chick-fil-A restaurants across the country \u00e2\u20ac\u201c encouraging gays and lesbians to share a public display of affection at the home of the chicken sandwich.\n",

This is a very tender and sensitive topic, as are many social issues, but I have the same view that I've had since running for office.\"\n Obama came out in support of same-sex marriage on Wednesday in an interview with ABC. The announcement prompted a flurry of responses, from Democrats praising his statements to Republicans decrying them.\n Romney said he supports states' rights to make decisions on domestic partnership benefits, including hospital visitation. Obama, while saying he personally supports same-sex marriage, also said the issue should be left to the states to decide.\n Romney's comments were far more measured than some other Republicans, who have openly accused the president of disrespecting religion and using the issue for political gain. Former GOP candidate Rick Santorum, for example, put out a statement shortly after Romney's remarks that claimed Obama \"has consistently fought against protecting the institution of marriage from radical social engineering at both the state and federal level.\"\n When asked whether Obama flip-flopped on same-sex marriage -- an accusation Romney has some experience with -- the presumptive Republican presidential nominee acknowledged the president's change, but said he'd leave the significance for others to decide.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I believe that, based upon the interview he gave today on ABC, it said that he had changed his view, but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a better judge of that than I am,\" Romney said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I just saw the reports that he had previously said he opposed same sex marriage and now, according to ABC News, he said that he supports it.

Calls and e-mails to a half-dozen advisers on the subject were not returned on Tuesday.\n Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, tried to deflect questions on behalf of Mr. Romney, saying on Fox News that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this is the platform of the Republican Party, it is not the platform of Mitt Romney.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The reluctance to talk about the platform reflects the delicate position that Mr. Romney is in when it comes to abortion policy.\n A supporter of abortion rights early in his political career, Mr. Romney later switched his position. This year, he captured the nomination of a party whose hard-core activists remained suspicious of Mr. Romney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late-in-life conversion to their cause.\n But as he prepares to accept that nomination next week in Tampa, Mr. Romney is once again being forced to carefully navigate between the uncompromising antiabortion positions of his party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s base and the more moderate politics of the swing voters he needs to win over.\n The vote on the platform is an important part of the Republican Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outreach to its conservative base. Mr. Romney and his aides have worked hard to ensure that social conservatives at the convention \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and the voters they represent \u00e2\u20ac\u201d do not feel left out.\n The party platform \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and the positions taken on abortion, same-sex marriage and other social issues \u00e2\u20ac\u201d are a key part of that effort.\n If Mr. Romney were to reject the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tough abortion plank, it would send a politically difficult message to conservatives about how Mr. Romney might govern once he got into the White House.\n There could also be a flurry of conservative outrage at the convention, which could distract from the carefully choreographed event Mr. Romney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategists are planning.\n But Mr. Romney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign is also trying hard to make sure that the convention projects an image that swing voters in battleground states will find appealing. Aides did not expect to be focusing heavily on the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s abortion positions this week.\n The campaign has already chosen in the last several weeks to move off its core message about jobs and the economy. The convention is intended to return the campaign\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s message to one of how Mr. Romney will get the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy back on track.\n In the current political environment involving Mr. Akin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, a decision by Mr. Romney to accept the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s abortion plank will open his campaign to attacks from his rivals that he is out of step with moderate, independent voters.\n Democrats have already pounced. Officials with the Democratic National Committee quickly called the Republican abortion position the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Akin plank\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and scheduled a news conference to denounce it.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153American women know that Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan and the party they lead are the wrong choice for women and their families,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d a statement from the Democratic committee said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mitt Romney should do the right thing and denounce this dangerous language.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Boehner met privately at the White House on Sunday as a top Republican senator suggested that his party should perhaps accede to Mr. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demand to raise the top tax rates so that the attention can shift to making serious cuts in benefit programs like Medicare and Medicaid.\n Administration officials would not offer details of the discussion between Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner. But the disclosure of the meeting indicated that private discussions continue in the face of Republican leaders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 public statements deploring the lack of progress and the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refusal so far to specify the sort of deep, long-term reductions in spending for social programs that they insist upon as a condition of their support for raising taxes on high earners.\n The White House and Mr. Boehner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office issued identical statements afterward that said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the lines of communication remain open.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The meeting was the first face-to-face negotiation between the president and the speaker since a session three weeks ago, when they were joined by the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California; the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada; and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. They were the first one-on-one deficit talks between Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner since the summer of 2011, when the search for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grand bargain\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d on taxes and spending ultimately failed.\n The latest meeting gave rise to renewed optimism that a deal could be reached before the end of the month.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My guess is still that we will reach a deal, but I do not think that anything is either certain or imminent,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Representative Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican and Boehner lieutenant, said Sunday night. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If they reach a deal, I suspect the majority of our conference will support the speaker. I hope the president can command equal support on his side of the aisle.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Any optimism is a step forward from Friday, when Mr. Boehner told reporters that he did not have a progress report because there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no progress to report.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But the ups and downs of the search for a deal to avert a fiscal crisis have been in large measure for public consumption. Between public statements and news conferences, the staffs of the president and the speaker have been in close contact.\n Just hours before the White House meeting, Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fox News Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d that a small but growing group of Republicans had begun considering acquiescing on tax rates so that the negotiations could shift to entitlement programs.\n Mr. Corker, a member of the Banking Committee who had presented a deficit-reduction plan of his own, said that if Republicans gave in to the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief demand, then \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all of a sudden the shift goes back to entitlements, and maybe it puts us in a place where we actually can do something that really saves the nation.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Republicans have been insisting that the Obama administration agree to substantial savings in entitlement programs as the two sides negotiate how to narrow the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge deficits. But Mr. Corker is part of a group of Republicans who say the party will ultimately have to yield to the Obama demand of higher tax rates for top earners, potentially back to the levels that prevailed under President Bill Clinton.\n That group of Republicans, Mr. Corker said on Fox, was beginning to realize \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a lot of cards as it relates to the tax issue before year end\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but that a tax-rate concession could be converted, jujitsu style, into a tactical advantage.\n Mr. Corker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments came as central figures on network news programs mixed cautious words of optimism over the negotiations between the White House and Congressional Republicans with dire warnings about what a failure to act might bring.\n Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned that such a failure was the gravest threat now facing the still-fragile United States economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201d greater than the European debt crisis or any uncertainty in China.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would result in the stock market really taking a hit,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ms. Lagarde said on the CNN program \u00e2\u20ac\u0153State of the Union.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d The overall result could be zero growth next year, not the 2.1 percent growth rate projected by the I.M.F.\n She called for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153balanced\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d agreement of both revenue increases and spending cuts. That is a word Mr. Obama has often used to describe his preferred outcome. Ms. Lagarde offered a tentative prediction that what she called American \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pragmatism\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d would prevail and avert the worst outcome.\n",

It came after Boehner publicly chided Obama on Friday for the lack of progress to date, accusing the president of having \"wasted another week.\"\n Both sides were tightlipped about the surprise Sunday afternoon meeting. But instead of emerging from the talks complaining about each other, as was the case following phone calls last week, each side released an identical statement.\n \"This afternoon, the President and Speaker Boehner met at the White House to discuss efforts to resolve the fiscal cliff. We're not reading out details of the conversation, but the lines of communication remain open,\" the statement released by each office said.\n Lawmakers and the White House have three weeks to reach a deal, before a potentially crippling set of tax hikes and spending cuts takes effect.\n Boehner last week put a counter-proposal on the table that included $800 billion in revenue increases over the next decade. While Boehner cast that as a significant concession, Obama said it didn't go far enough because it didn't include an increase in tax rates for the top 2 percent.\n Boehner, though, is facing some pressure from Republicans to give a little bit more.\n The speaker is effectively caught between two competing wings of the Republican Party. Some say Congress should not raise any taxes, and were disappointed he went so far as to put any revenue on the table. However, a growing number of Republicans are suggesting the party should give Obama what he wants on tax rates -- and focus instead on winning entitlement cuts once that is cleared away.\n Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., became the latest Republican to open the door to tax rate hikes during an interview on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n \"There is a growing group of folks that are looking at this and realizing that we don't have a lot of cards as it relates to the tax issue, before year-end. I mean, we have one house, that's it,\" Corker said.\n Corker suggested that Republicans instead focus on extracting entitlement cuts as part of the debt-ceiling negotiations.\n \"Republicans know that they have the debt ceiling that's coming up right around the corner, and the leverage is going to shift, as soon as we get beyond this issue,\" Corker said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"The leverage is going to shift to our side, where hopefully we'll do the same thing we did last time.\"\n Corker said that if the president wants to raise the debt limit by $2 trillion, Republicans should press for $2 trillion in spending cuts.\n That prospect is sure to infuriate the White House. After the bruising debt-ceiling fight from 2011, Obama recently warned that he will not \"play that game\" again. \"We've got to break that habit before it starts,\" the president said.\n The president argues that fights over the debt ceiling merely shake global confidence in the country's ability to pay its bills, and as part of talks over the looming fiscal crisis has called for a de facto permanent increase in the debt limit.\n It's unclear whether Obama might drop that demand if he gets what he wants on tax rates.\n His campaign-style visit to Detroit, though, threatens to muddy the waters on talks.\n Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the No. 3 Republican in the House, suggested Sunday that the president's itinerary has left Republicans to negotiate with themselves.\n \"He's been to Pennsylvania. Tomorrow he is going to Detroit. It's now time to govern. The election is over,\" he said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n Democratic Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin countered that Obama \"is a phone call away and you know it.\"\n",

Oh, not a theology based on the Bible, a different theology,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But no less a theology.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n On Sunday, Robert Gibbs, a political adviser to President Obama, criticized such attacks on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153character and faith.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but think that those remarks are well over the line. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrong. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s destructive,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Gibbs said on the ABC News program \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This Week,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d adding that it reflected the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nastiness, divisiveness, ugliness\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and distortions of a hard-fought Republican nominating process.\n Mr. Santorum, at another appearance on Saturday, in Columbus, Ohio, called the idea of schools being run by the federal government or by state governments \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anachronistic.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Santorum did not say public schools were a bad idea, and he said that there was a role for government help in education.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Where did they come up that public education and bigger education bureaucracies was the rule in America?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Parents educated their children, because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their responsibility to educate their children.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes the government can help,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Santorum added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the idea that the federal government should be running schools, frankly \u00e2\u20ac\u201d much less that the state government should be running schools \u00e2\u20ac\u201d is anachronistic. It goes back to the time of industrialization of America when people came off the farms where they did home-school or have the little neighborhood school, and into these big factories, so we built equal factories called public schools. And while those factories as we all know in Ohio and Pennsylvania have fundamentally changed, the factory school has not.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Asked about those remarks on the CBS News program \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Face the Nation,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Santorum, who with his wife has home-schooled their children, remained adamant on Sunday.\n While he said he did not oppose government financing of schools, Mr. Santorum said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153public education should be a dynamic process that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s locally run.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the parent should be in charge,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he added, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153working with the local school district to try to design an educational environment for each child that optimizes their potential.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Santorum also defended his criticism of a requirement in the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health-care policy that insurance companies to cover prenatal testing. He had said earlier that the policy was included to save money \u00e2\u20ac\u0153because free prenatal testing ends up in more abortions and therefore less care that has to be done, because we cull the ranks of the disabled in our society.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The former Pennsylvania senator has a 3-year-old daughter, Bella, with a serious chromosomal disorder, and he said that doctors who detect such a condition before birth typically recommend abortion.\n Asked whether he was suggesting that Mr. Obama lacked sympathy for the disabled, Mr. Santorum did not back down, saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the president has a very bad record on the issue of abortion and children who are disabled.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n One of Mr. Santorum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rivals for the Republican nomination, Representative Ron Paul of Texas, scoffed at Mr. Santorum on Sunday for focusing on social issues like abortion and contraception \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and for believing that he could defeat Mr. Obama.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see how that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Paul said on the CNN program \u00e2\u20ac\u0153State of the Union.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And this whole idea about talking about the social issues and who is going to pay for birth control pills,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Paul said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m worried about undermining our civil liberties, the constant wars going on, the debt of $16 trillion. And they are worried about birth control pills?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Myers. The flight is ultimately going to be $1 million, the official said - a media-tracking source said about $400,000 has been placed so far.\n Those markets house some of the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest Jewish communities.\n The pollster for Secure America Now is John McLaughlin, who has worked with Netanyahu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Likud Party.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The ad features Netanyahu laying out Israel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security concerns about Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear program, which Republicans have used to knock President Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sometimes frosty relationship with the Israeli prime minister.\n Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has repeatedly targeted the Obama administration for not taking a firm enough stance against Iran, claiming on many occasions that the president has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thrown Israel under a bus.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d The GOP also has attacked the president for declining an opportunity to meet with Netanyahu at the United Nations General Assembly later this month in an effort to paint the current White House as dismissive of Israel and its concerns.\n But Netanyahu pushed back against these criticisms in two separate interviews on Sunday, first telling CNN, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I know that people are trying to draw me into the American election. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to do that.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He also rejected reports that Obama refused his request for a meeting, pinning the circumstances on a scheduling conflict, as has the White House when pressed on the subject.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153President Obama has said that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s determined to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons and I appreciate that and I respect that,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Netanyahu said on NBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Meet the Press.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n When asked if Obama had thrown Israel under a bus, Netanyahu responded, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no bus.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the first ad Secure America Now has run against Obama, even though on its website the organization describes itself as representing all political ideologies. In July, the group released an ad pushing the same attack line employed by Romney, accusing the president of embarking on a so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153apology tour\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d at the expense of American security.\n The Obama administration is not mentioned by name in the latest spot, but it implicitly underscores the GOP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s narrative on the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closest ally.\n",

Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), charging at Republican Mitt Romney's running mate from the get-go and bombarding him with a flurry of eye rolls, interjections and accusations.\n What it accomplished among undecided voters, if anything, is hard to tell and will take days to sort out. Two instant surveys of Americans watching the debate -- one by CBS, one by CNN -- showed mixed results. But since vice presidential debates often have a negligible impact on the overall race anyway, Biden's sometimes over-the-top performance probably accomplished what he appeared intent on doing: rallying the Democratic base after Obama's woeful debate performance last week.\n Obama, at least, was cheered by the offensive.\n \"I'm going to make a special point of saying that I thought Joe Biden was terrific tonight,\" the president told reporters after stepping off Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, on his way back to the White House after a day of campaigning in Florida.\n Biden looked as if he could barely stay in his seat for much of the night, interrupting Ryan repeatedly and sometimes making it difficult for the GOP nominee to get out his answers.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He had his Red Bull. He certainly had his caffeine,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said after the debate.\n It was a performance by the vice president guaranteed to amp up -\u00e2\u20ac\u201c and buck up -\u00e2\u20ac\u201c worried Democrats, who had fallen into a paralysis of anxiety after the president's debate. No one represented that Democratic angst more than blogger Andrew Sullivan, a supporter of the president.\n Obama adviser David Axelrod said \"Andrew is a unique thinker, and I can't speak for how he might react to this. I hope he is [reassured],\" Axelrod said, adding that he had \"high regard for [Sullivan] by the way.\"\n Sullivan, for the record, called the night \"a solid win for Biden\" and called Ryan \"competent.\"\n The Obama campaign team, in the spin room after the debate, focused on repeating the theme that, as Axelrod said, Biden showed \"passion\" and that he showed \"a great concern for the middle class.\" Passion was the thing Obama lacked last week, and Romney surprised the president and Democrats by talking constantly about how his policies would help the middle class.\n By contrast, Romney operatives in the spin room said Ryan clearly won on substance and composure while Biden devolved into fits of laughter and audible groans.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the way the vice president handled himself was condescending,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He was constantly interrupting and trying to talk over people. When my 11-year-old tries to do that at the dinner table, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not tolerated.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Democrats were intent Thursday night to steal back any edge Romney might have deprived them of in being the party who can appeal to working class and blue-collar voters, and to any voter who considers themselves middle class, which is a large number.\n \"These guys discovered the phrase 'middle class' during the last six months on the campaign trail,\" said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who has sparred with Ryan on the House Budget Committee for years and who played Ryan in debate preparation with Biden.\n Though it was Biden at the center of attention and who made it hard for Ryan to get in a word edgewise at times, the 42-year-old kept his composure for much of the night and got in some well-aimed shots at the vice president, who at 69 is his senior by 27 years. Ryan seemed focused more on winning over moderate and independent voters who are still making up their minds, less than a month before the election.\n The night's 90-minute debate, the only one for the two vice presidential candidates, fluctuated between domestic policy and foreign policy, with ABC's Martha Raddatz, a reporter with vast foreign policy experience, asking numerous questions about events overseas.\n But the number one goal for Biden all night was obvious from the outset: push back. Hard. It was the number one thing that Democrats had said Obama should have done last week, and it foreshadowed how the president will approach next Tuesday's debate with Romney, the second of three debates for the two men running for president.\n After Ryan finished his opening statement, responding to a question about the death of the U.S. ambassador to Libya in a terrorist attack in Benghazi a month ago, Biden responded: \"That's a bunch of malarkey.\"\n \"Not a single thing he said is accurate,\" Biden said.\n At times, Biden repeatedly butted in on Ryan's answers, refusing to let Ryan finish his thought. If it were anyone other than Biden, who is treated by the press as a lovable, half-crazy uncle, he would have been labeled insufferable. Instead, he got the aggressive label.\n Republicans thought it was much more than that. Republican National Committee spokesman Tim Miller called Biden \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unhinged.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom tweeted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ryan: serious, sober, steady. Biden: smirking, mocking, immature.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Some of the more experienced Republicans tried to resist talking about Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behavior, knowing it would come across as complaining.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most people probably found the vice president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance a little -- well anyway, I think that people will judge for themselves,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Ed Gillespie, one of the top advisers to Romney and one of the most seasoned Republican operatives in politics.\n But not even Gillespie, when he was asked by a reporter where he was going before he cut himself off, could resist getting some digs at Biden.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don't know if his staff didn't brief him or not, but somebody should have told him that these debates are split-screen,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Gillespie said.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There seemed to be some frustration on his part at times, and sometimes I got the impression that he couldn't defend the facts as they were, [so] raise your voice a little louder,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Gillespie said.\n The Obama campaign, of course, relished in Republicans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 focus on Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behavior instead of the substance of his remarks.\n \"Their side is all spending their time talking about laughing and facial tics,\" said Obama campaign manager Jim Messina. \"You're going to do that when you've lost a debate. And that's what happened tonight: they lost the debate.\"\n Of course, Biden was so demonstrative, so outsized, that it was hard to talk about anything else.\n Biden did another thing Obama did not a week ago. He raised the issue of Romney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments at a fundraiser in May in which he talked disparagingly about people who receive government benefits, claiming that he could \u00e2\u20ac\u0153never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\"\n One of Ryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best one-liners came when he sought to explain these comments.\n Ryan first told a humanizing story about Romney caring for a family whose children were in a car crash, a story clearly prepared to push back against the portrait of Romney as out of touch and uncaring. And he then added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With respect to that quote, I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Although there were extended portions of the debate that focused on Libya, Syria, and Afghanistan, Biden and Ryan did engage in a lengthy back-and-forth in the middle of the debate on Medicare and tax policy.\n Ryan was, as usual, knowledgeable and in command of the facts. But Biden, as expected, attempted to plow him over with broadsides.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stop talking about how you care about people. Show me something. Show me a policy,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Biden said.\n Ryan smiled, and continued to work through a data-filled argument, mentioning the $831 billion stimulus, an 8 percent unemployment rate for 43 months, the 1.3 percent growth rate of the economy, the $90 billion for green energy programs in the stimulus, and the 12 million jobs he and Romney say their economic program would create.\n Biden didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry so much about numbers. Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s argument on Medicare was aimed at voters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 guts, much more so than minds. He acknowledged that Romney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Medicare plan would not cost seniors an extra $6,400 a year, despite the claim in a recently launched Obama campaign ad.\n The $6,400 figure is based on a study of one of Ryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier plans for Medicare, which he has since changed to make it more bipartisan.\n Biden, aware of this, told voters they should be suspicious somebody \u00e2\u20ac\u0153who would actually put in motion a plan that \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 added $6,400 a year more to the cost of Medicare?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Paul Ryan is heading to Georgetown University for a speech Thursday morning, but not before an old-fashioned, Catholic school knuckle-rapping.\n A group of nearly 90 professors and administrators connected to the Jesuit-founded school in Washington, D.C., has sent Ryan, R-Wis., a letter saying he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s misused Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing, GOP House budget.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We appreciate your willingness to talk about how Catholic social teaching can help inform effective policy in dealing with the urgent challenges facing our country,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the letter states. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, we would be remiss \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 if we did not challenge your continuing misuse of Catholic teaching to defend a budget plan that decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Ryan, since introducing the budget last month, has talked about the doctrine in several interviews including one a couple weeks ago on the Christian Broadcasting Network.\n In that interview, he invoked the Catholic teaching of \"subsidiarity,\" saying it means \"not having big government crowd out civic society, but ... having enough space in our communities so that we can interact with each other\" and take care of people.\n \"To me, the principle of subsidiarity, which is really federalism, meaning government closest to the people governs best,\" he said.\n The Georgetown University letter argues, though, that Ryan misappropriated the Catholic teaching as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rationale for gutting government programs.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The writers acknowledge that the teaching indeed calls for local-level solutions to problems but say it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not a free pass to dismantle government\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and requires higher levels of government.\n The statement also quotes from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' letters to Congress saying budgets cannot rely on disproportionate cuts in essential services to the poor.\n Ryan, a Catholic and chairman of the House Budget Committee, said last week the letters do not express the views of all U.S. bishops, a point on which the conference disagrees.\n Georgetown's Public Policy Institute, which is hosting the upcoming Ryan lecture, said Wednesday the event is still scheduled for Thursday morning.\n \"Chairman Ryan remains grateful for Georgetown's invitation to advance a thoughtful dialogue this week on his efforts to avert a looming debt crisis that would hurt the poor the first and the worst,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d a Ryan spokesman said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He looks forward to affirming our shared commitment to a preferential option for the poor, which of course does not mean a preferential option for bigger government.\"\n Ryan, who was raised on Social Security benefits after his father died, also on Fox News defended his budget against the conference, saying for instance that the concept of denying tax credits to illegal immigrants is merely \"following through on policy\" that has had bipartisan support.\n",

I accept the fact that the president is a Christian,\" Santorum said.\n \"I was talking about the radical environmentalist,\" he said. \"I was talking about energy, this idea that man is here to serve the Earth as opposed to husband its resources and be good stewards of the Earth. And I think that is a phony ideal.\n \"I don't believe that that's what we're here to do. That man is here to use the resources and use them wisely, to care for the Earth, to be a steward of the Earth, but we're not here to serve the Earth. The Earth is not the objective. Man is the objective. And I think a lot of radical environmentalists have it upside down,\" Santorum said.\n But the president's campaign, responding forcefully to the new frontrunner in the GOP race, said the remark is a personal affront.\n \"I can't help but think that those remarks are well over the line. It's wrong. It's destructive,\" said Robert Gibbs, the president's former press secretary who is now working on Obama's reelection effort.\n \"It's time to get rid of this. It's time to have a debate on our political positions, but not question each other's character and faith,\" he said.\n Obama campaign deputy press secretary Ben Labolt also issued a statement Saturday shortly after Santorum told voters that Obama's agenda is \"not about you. It's not about your quality of life. It's not about your jobs. It's about some phony ideal. Some phony theology. Not a theology based on the Bible. A different theology.\"\n The comment was \"the latest low in a Republican primary campaign that has been fueled by distortions, ugliness, and searing pessimism and negativity.\" It was \"a stark contrast with the president who is focused everyday on creating jobs and restoring economic security for the middle class,\" LaBolt said.\n Santorum, who has pulled ahead of Mitt Romney in polling for the 2012 Republican presidential primary nod, said Sunday that when he used the word \"theology\" he was referring to a \"world view that elevates the Earth above man.\"\n That world view, Santorum continued, suggests that man could harm the Earth by using the resources available even while relying on claims that \"frankly are just not scientifically proven, for example, the politicization of the whole global warming debate.\"\n \"I mean, this is just all an attempt to, you know, to centralize power and to give more power to the government,\" Santorum said.\n Santorum said he never questioned the president's faith and repeatedly said he believes Obama is a Christian.\n \"He says he is a Christian. But I am talking about his world view or his -- the way he approaches problems in this country. And I think they're different than how most people do in America,\" he said.\n But while Gibbs said it's time to get off the \"mindset that if we disagree, we have to disqualify each other\" comments like Santorum's show that the GOP primary \"has been a race to the bottom. We have seen nastiness, divisiveness, ugliness, distortions of opponents' records, of the president's record.\"\n Santorum appeared on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" Gibbs was on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n",

But I am talking about his worldview, the way he addresses problems in this country, and they're different than most people view it in America.\"\n In a speech to Tea Party conservatives on Saturday in Columbus, Ohio, Santorum had dismissed Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politics as being based in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some phony theology.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \"It's not about you. It's not about your quality of life. It's not about your jobs,\" Santorum said. \"It's about some phony ideal, some phony theology. Oh, not a theology based on the Bible. A different theology.\"\n An incredulous Bob Schieffer began his interview with Santorum Sunday by asking, \"What in the world were you talking about?\"\n \"I was talking about the radical environmentalists,\" Santorum said, suggesting that they believe man should protect the earth, rather than \"steward its resources.\" \"I think that is a phony ideal. I don't believe that's what we're here to do ... We're not here to serve the earth. That is not the objective, man is the objective.\"\n Earlier in the day on Saturday, Santorum had also said that health insurance plans shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be required to cover prenatal testing, because that testing results in more abortions, as well as contending that government-run public education was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anachronistic.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \"Free prenatal testing ends up in more abortions and therefore less care that has to be done, because we cull the ranks of the disabled in our society,\" Santorum told the Ohio Christian Alliance conference.\n Asked by Schieffer about his claims that prenatal testing leads to more abortions, Santorum insisted that this was \"a fact.\"\n \"We're talking about specifically prenatal testing, and specifically amniocentesis, which is a procedure that actually creates a risk of having a miscarriage when you have it, and is done for the purposes of identifying maladies of a child in the womb. And in many cases -- and in fact in most cases -- most physicians recommend, if there is a problem, they recommend abortion,\" Santorum said.\n Santorum had said that because of this trend, health insurance providers should not be forced to make the procedures available free of charge.\n Santorum also told Schieffer that government-provided education was not working and that the process ought to be customizable, like buying a car.\n \"I'm saying that local communities and parents should be the ones in control over public education, certainly not the federal government, and I think the state governments have not done a particularly good job in public education, either,\" Santorum said.\n Buying a car, by contrast he said, is \"designed to meet the needs of a customer. Federally or state-run education is not designed to meet the needs of the customer.\"\n Speaking earlier on ABC's \"This Week\" about Santorum's remarks, Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs called his rhetoric \"well over the line.\"\n \"I think it's time in our politics that we get rid of this mindset that if we disagree, we have to disqualify each other,\" Gibbs said.\n \"I think if you make comments like that, you make comments that are well over the line,\" he added. \"I think the GOP race has been, in many cases, a race to the bottom.\"\n",

Nothing in the emails supports theories that the talking points were changed in order to influence the 2012 election.\n In a briefing with reporters at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, senior administration officials used the 100 pages of emails to show that a number of government agencies, not just the State Department, drove many of the changes to the talking points that were ultimately used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice.\n The cache of emails paint a fuller picture than did an email leaked earlier this week, which portrayed a State Department concerned about its public image.\n Republican lawmakers have argued that the State Department and the White House were attempting to alter the talking points for political reasons and ignored suggestions and language put forward by the CIA. In particular, they pointed to the fact that references to al Qaeda and previous security warnings were removed. But senior administration officials stressed on Wednesday that such language in fact was taken out at the request of the CIA.\n Critics have said the role of State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland in revising the talking points in particular shows an administration trying to protect its reputation as being tough on terrorism. They have criticized Nuland for requesting to remove a line from the final draft noting that there had been \"at least five other attacks against foreign interests in Benghazi by unidentified assailants.\"\n Nuland said in a Sept. 14 email that she didn't want that information included because it \"could be abused by members [of Congress] to beat up the State Department for not paying attention to warnings, so why would we want to feed that either? Concerned ...\"\n But senior administration officials on Wednesday said that Michael J. Morell, then the deputy director of the CIA, also wanted that line removed, separately from Nuland. Morell believed it was irrelevant to the message of the talking points -- what happened in Benghazi -- and unprofessional to include those warnings but not allow State Department officials to include how they had responded to them.\n Separate from Wednesday's document release, the CIA recently conducted an internal review of how and why the talking points were changed -- a move that also came in response to the continuing questions from Congress. That review showed that many changes were made to the original talking points -- drafted by a senior officer -- over concerns about accuracy, an FBI investigation and other bureaucratic matters. A U.S. intelligence official told The Huffington Post the review was completed \"early this year.\"\n Senior administration officials, discussing that internal review, relayed that some CIA officials didn't like that the original draft of the talking points said the government \"know[s] that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qa'ida participated in the attack,\" because at that time it was premature to name those responsible for the attacks.\n Their concerns at other times were more mundane. For example, CIA officials also decided to change the phrase \"attacks in Benghazi ... evolved into a direct assault against the US Consulate\" to \"demonstrations in Benghazi\" because they believed \"attacks\" and \"assault\" were synonymous, making the phrase illogical.\n CIA officers also removed the reference to al Qaeda in order to avoid prejudging the outcome of a FBI investigation into the incident. A reference to another terrorist group, Ansar al-Sharia, was left in, but later removed at the request of the State Department; the CIA agreed with that decision, again so as not to hinder the FBI investigation.\n The timing of the White House's document release raises its own set of questions. Why, for example, did the administration choose to make the emails public now, after months of enduring criticism and requests for more information? If the material was too sensitive to share publicly months, weeks or days ago, what changed on Wednesday?\n While the document dump does soften some of the more critical theories that have arisen with respect to the White House's handling of the events in Benghazi, it could also embolden critics who now see an administration willing to accommodate demands for documents.\n In a response shortly after the emails were made public on Wednesday, Brendan Buck, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), said just that.\n \"The House interim report found that 'senior State Department officials requested the talking points be changed to avoid criticism for ignoring the threat environment in Benghazi' and that those changes were ultimately made,\" said Buck. \"Those findings are confirmed by the emails released today, and they contradict statements made by the White House that it and the State Department only changed one word in the talking points. The seemingly political nature of the State Department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns raises questions about the motivations behind these changes and who at the State Department was seeking them.\"\n UPDATE: 9 p.m. -- White House spokesman Eric Schultz said he hoped Wednesday's disclosure would put to rest the Benghazi issue.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite the fact that e-mails relating to the Benghazi talking points were made available to members of Congress several months ago, in recent days these e-mails have been selectively and inaccurately read out to the media. To make clear what is and is not in these e-mails, today the White House took the extraordinary step of releasing these e-mails,\" Schultz said. \"You can now see what the Congress has seen -- collectively these emails make clear that the interagency process, including the White House's interactions, were focused on providing the facts as we knew them based on the best information available at the time and protecting an ongoing investigation. After 11 hearings, 25,000 pages of documents, and now this release, we can hopefully spend our time working on what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what we can do together to ensure those serving their nation overseas are better protected than they were last September.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Jesse Jackson Jr. pleaded guilty Wednesday in federal court to charges that he spent $750,000 in campaign cash on personal items.\n The Illinois Democrat faces up to five years in prison, but guidelines recommend slightly less. Sentencing has been set for June 28.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I truly understand the consequences of my actions and of the preceding,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Jackson said through tears. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I did these things. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I used money that should have been used for my campaign.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Federal prosecutors say Jackson, who resigned from Congress in November amid the investigation and health issues, used campaign money to buy items including a $43,350 gold-plated men's Rolex watch and $9,587.64 worth of children's furniture.\n He and his wife, Sandra, had agreed to plead guilty in deals with federal prosecutors. Jackson's guilty plea was to a conspiracy charge.\n His wife later pleaded guilty Wednesday to a charge of filing false joint federal income tax returns for the years 2006 through 2011 that knowingly understated the income the couple received.\n Jackson told the judge that he had been hospitalized for psychological issues. The whole hearing lasted about 50 minutes.\n \"Not a proud day,\" he said. \"I'm sorry I let everybody down.\"\n The Jacksons were appearing separately before U.S. District Judge Robert L. Wilkins in Washington, D.C. Jackson's wife spent $5,150 on fur capes and parkas, court documents said.\n When prosecutors charged the couple last Friday, the ex-congressman said he fully accepts the responsibility for the improper decisions and mistakes he has made. Tom Kirsch, an attorney for Jackson's wife, said she has signed a plea agreement with federal prosecutors and would plead guilty to one tax count.\n The conspiracy charge against the former congressman carries a maximum statutory penalty of up to five years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, and other penalties.\n The charge against Sandra Jackson carries a maximum of three years in prison. However, one of her lawyers, Tom Kirsch, says the plea agreement \"does not contemplate a sentence of that length.\" Sandra Jackson was a Chicago alderman before she resigned last month during the federal investigation.\n In court papers filed against Jackson on Friday, prosecutors said that upon conviction he must forfeit $750,000, plus tens of thousands of dollars' worth of memorabilia items and furs. The memorabilia includes a football signed by U.S. presidents, a Michael Jackson fedora, and memorabilia of Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Jimi Hendrix and Bruce Lee -- all from a company called Antiquities of Nevada.\n As the hearing for Jackson got under way Wednesday, newly filed court papers disclosed that the judge had offered to disqualify himself from handling the cases against Jackson and his wife.\n As a Harvard Law School student, Wilkins said he had supported the presidential campaign of Jackson's father, civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, and that as an attorney in 1999, Wilkins had been a guest on a show hosted by Jackson's father.\n In the newly filed court papers, prosecutors and lawyers for both Jesse Jackson Jr. and Sandra Jackson said they were willing to proceed with the cases with Wilkins presiding. Judicial ethics require that a judge disqualify himself if his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\n",

But it did little to placate her sister.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not something to be decided by a show of hands,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mary Cheney wrote.\n And to emphasize that she was not shying away from drawing attention to her view, Mary Cheney concluded her Facebook post: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Please like and share if you agree.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In an e-mail, Mary Cheney declined to comment further on her sister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position, saying she would let her Facebook post speak for itself.\n The Cheney family dispute mirrors the broader disagreement among Republicans on same-sex marriage. Less than a decade after George W. Bush and Dick Cheney won re-election in part thanks to conservative enthusiasm over enshrining traditional marriage into law, some in the party believe they are losing voters, particularly younger ones, over an issue on which public opinion has changed rapidly. But other Republicans believe traditional marriage is a pillar of family values, and in some cases are reluctant to abandon their social conservative base on the issue.\n Liz Cheney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance underlines the degree to which full-throated support for same-sex marriage, even in a libertarian-leaning state like Wyoming, still poses a political risk in a Republican primary.\n Mr. Enzi opposes legalizing same-sex marriage.\n",

She jousted with Republican lawmakers over who deserved blame for the security problems at the compound, and choked up as she described being at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington when the bodies of the Americans killed in the assault arrived from Libya.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I put my arms around the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The continuing controversy over the attack, which resulted in the deaths of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, has cast a cloud over Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final months at the State Department. It also has enormous political implications for Mrs. Clinton, the former New York senator who is already regarded as the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination if she chooses to run. It was the first time she had faced extensive questioning about her role in the episode.\n In essence, Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach was to accept the responsibility for security lapses in Benghazi but not the blame.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel responsible for the nearly 70,000 people who work for the State Department,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mrs. Clinton told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the morning. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the specific security requests pertaining to Benghazi, you know, were handled by the security professionals in the department. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see those requests. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come to me. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t approve them. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deny them.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n When the question of her role was taken up again in the afternoon hearing by Representative Ed Royce, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that she had been briefed on a series of events that indicated that security in Benghazi was deteriorating in the months before the attack. They included the placement of a bomb at the outer wall of the compound in June and an ambush that month on the British ambassador.\n But she said she had gone along with a recommendation from subordinates that the Benghazi post be kept open and assumed that they would take the necessary steps to protect it.\n Mrs. Clinton first publicly took responsibility for the Sept. 11 attack in an Oct. 15 interview with television reporters. Since then, she has committed herself to putting in place all of the recommendations of an independent review that was led by Thomas R. Pickering, a former American ambassador, and Mike Mullen, the retired admiral who served as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n For all of the hours of testimony, the hearings did little to clarify the role of the White House in overseeing the American presence in Libya before the attack or explain why the Pentagon had few forces available on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to respond quickly to any assault on diplomatic outposts in the region.\n One of the sharpest exchanges of the day came when Mrs. Clinton responded to questions from Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, by saying there was too much focus on how the Benghazi attack had been characterized in its early hours and not enough on how to prevent a recurrence. Republicans have repeatedly charged that Obama administration officials deliberately played down the attack, focusing much of their criticism on Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations and once Mr. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s choice to succeed Mrs. Clinton.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Was it because of a protest, or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mrs. Clinton said, her voice rising. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, began his questions by saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wonderful to see you in good health and as combative as ever,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and then proceeded to complain that she had failed to answer lingering questions.\n Mr. McCain asserted that the Obama administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aversion to nation-building had precluded it from providing the kind of training and assistance that would have helped the fledgling Libyan government in Tripoli confront growing security threats from militants.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We did not give them the kind of assistance that would have been necessary to help dismantle these militias that still, to this day, remain a challenge to democracy in Libya,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n Mrs. Clinton responded that Congress had delayed aid to Libya and said she would provide a list of steps that had been taken to train and equip Libyan forces.\n A persistent line of questioning by Republican lawmakers concerned the initial comments from Ms. Rice that the attack might have resulted from a protest, over an anti-Islamic video, that spun out of control.\n Mrs. Clinton defended Ms. Rice even as she appeared to distance herself from Ms. Rice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I told the American people that heavily armed militants assaulted our compound, and I vowed to bring them to justice,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mrs. Clinton said.\n The Senate Foreign Relations Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, has been nominated to succeed Mrs. Clinton and is scheduled to appear before his committee on Thursday for a confirmation hearing. To avoid the perception of a conflict of interest, the hearing on Wednesday was led by Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, the incoming chairman, and Mr. Kerry did not attend.\n In a rare criticism of the committee by one of its members, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the ranking Republican, complained that the panel Mr. Kerry led had failed to conduct proper oversight of security and other State Department issues.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is an opportunity for this committee to finally do the work that it should have been doing for years,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Corker said.\n Mrs. Clinton sought to put the events in Benghazi in a regional context, noting the presence of a group in northern Mali affiliated with Al Qaeda.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Benghazi didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen in a vacuum,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Arab revolutions have scrambled power dynamics and shattered security forces across the region. And instability in Mali has created an expanding safe haven for terrorists who look to extend their influence and plot further attacks of the kind we saw just last week in Algeria.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are in for a struggle, but it is a necessary struggle,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We cannot permit northern Mali to become a safe haven.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

A former senior NSA official confirmed to Fox News that the program was started in 2007 by the FBI and NSA and allows them to tap into top U.S. Internet companies to pull audio, video and other data.\n While civil liberties groups cried foul over the program, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper issued a statement late Thursday decrying the leak of the materials. He called the disclosure of the program that allows the NSA to collect communications data from Internet companies \"reprehensible\" and said the phone-records monitoring leak could cause harm to the nation's intelligence gathering activities.\n At the same time, he took the rare step of moving to declassify information about the programs as he sought to defend them against criticism.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The article omits key information regarding how a classified intelligence collection program is used to prevent terrorist attacks and the numerous safeguards that protect privacy and civil liberties,\" he said of the Guardian story.\n Clapper also said the government was \"prohibited from indiscriminately sifting through the telephony metadata acquired under the program.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d All information acquired, he said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is subject to strict, court-imposed restrictions on review and handling. The court only allows the data to be queried when there is a reasonable suspicion, based on specific facts, that the particular basis for the query is associated with a foreign terrorist organization.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153\n Several hours earlier, a senior administration official also pushed back, saying the Guardian article and Washington Post article about the Internet mining refers to collection under a law that \"does not allow the targeting of any U.S. citizen or of any person located within the United States.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n It was not immediately clear how the official defined \u00e2\u20ac\u0153targeting.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The program is subject to oversight by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the Executive Branch, and Congress,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the official said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It involves extensive procedures, specifically approved by the court, to ensure that only non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. are targeted, and that minimize the acquisition, retention and dissemination of incidentally acquired information about U.S. persons.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n A former NSA official told Fox News the FBI and National Security Agency (NSA) have been tapping into leading U.S. Internet companies to pull audio, video and photographs.\n According to the official, the program began in 2007 and is in the second phase. Metadata from the companies is used to identify suspicious individuals and the secondary search goes into content. The official told Fox News that the Utah Data Center is likely a repository for this material.\n The classified program is code-named PRISM, the Washington Post reported, and has not been disclosed publicly before. Members of Congress who are aware of the program were reportedly bound by oath to keep it confidential.\n According to slides from an internal presentation intended for NSA senior analysts and obtained by the Washington Post, the program accounts for nearly one in seven intelligence reports.\n The companies that participate knowingly in the program are Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube and Apple, the Washington Post reports.\n A number of the Internet companies issued statements Thursday night saying they only complied when legally bound to do so.\n \"Even when the system works just as advertised, with no American singled out for targeting, the NSA routinely collects a great deal of American content,\" the Washington Post report said. \"That is described as \"incidental,\" and it is inherent in contact chaining, one of the basic tools of the trade.\"\n To be immune from lawsuits, companies like Yahoo and AOL are reportedly obliged to accept a directive from the attorney general and national intelligence director to open their service to the FBI's Data Intercept Technology Unit, which acts as a liaison between the companies and the NSA.\n According to the slides, there has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continued exponential growth in tasking to Facebook and Skype.\"\n \"With a few clicks and an affirmation that the subject is believed to be engaged in terrorism, espionage or nuclear proliferation, an analyst obtains full access to Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 'extensive search and surveillance capabilities against the variety of online social networking services,'\" the Washington Post reports.\n Skype can reportedly be monitored for audio when one end of a call is a conventional telephone and also can be monitored for video, chat and file transfers when users connect just by a computer. Google services that can be monitored include Gmail, voice and video chat, Google Drive files, and search terms.\n A spokesperson for Google says the company \"cares deeply\" about the security of users' data.\n \"We disclose user data to government in accordance with the law, and we review all such requests carefully,\" the spokesperson said. \"From time to time, people allege that we have created a government 'back door' into our systems, but Google does not have a 'back door' for the government to access private user data.\"\n \"Protecting the privacy of our users and their data is a top priority for Facebook,\" the company's chief security officer Joe Sullivan said in a statement. \"We do not provide any government organization with direct access to Facebook servers. When Facebook is asked for data or information about specific individuals, we carefully scrutinize any such request for compliance with all applicable laws, and provide information only to the extent required by law.\"\n A Microsoft spokesperson said that the company only provides customer data after receiving a legally binding order or subpoena.\n \"In addition we only ever comply with orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers,\" the spokesperson said. \"If the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data we don't participate in it.\"\n",

But given the difficulty of pushing new rules through a bitterly divided Congress, Mr. Obama will also promise to act on his own to reduce gun violence wherever possible.\n Actions the president could take on his own are likely to include imposing new limits on guns imported from overseas, compelling federal agencies to improve sharing of mental health records and directing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct research on gun violence, according to those briefed on the effort.\n White House aides believe Mr. Obama can also ratchet up enforcement of existing laws, including tougher prosecution of people who lie on their background checks.\n At a news conference on Monday, exactly one month after the school massacre in Newtown, Conn., Mr. Obama said a task force led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153presented me now with a list of sensible, common-sense steps that can be taken to make sure that the kinds of violence we saw at Newtown doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen again. He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My starting point is not to worry about the politics. My starting point is to focus on what makes sense, what works.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy reflects the uncertainty of gun politics in America and the desire by White House officials to address the Connecticut shooting while also confronting the broader deficiencies in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criminal justice and mental health systems.\n By proposing to use the independent power of his office, Mr. Obama is inviting political attacks by gun owners who have already expressed fear that he will abuse that authority to restrict their rights. Representative Steve Stockman, Republican of Texas, threatened Monday to file articles of impeachment if the president seeks to regulate guns with executive orders. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will seek to thwart this action by any means necessary,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Stockman said in a statement.\n White House officials and Democratic lawmakers said that there are clear limits to what the president can and cannot do, and that Mr. Obama has no plans to push beyond what he would need Congressional authority to accomplish.\n On Capitol Hill, Mr. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legislative effort will face intense opposition from gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association, and the lawmakers they support with millions of dollars at election time and who see gun rights as a defining issue in their districts. But Mr. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allies see a rare opening for tighter gun rules after Congress has shied away from the politically charged issue for years.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s putting together a pretty comprehensive list of what could be done to make a difference in this area,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Representative Mike Thompson of California, who is heading a Democratic task force in the House. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some huge, huge holes in the process that are set up to keep communities safe. We need to close those holes.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, said Vice President Biden had informed lawmakers during a two-hour briefing on Monday that there are \u00e2\u20ac\u015319 independent steps that the president can take by executive order.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ms. Speier said the executive action is part of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153most comprehensive gun safety effort in a generation.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago and Mr. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former chief of staff, joined the debate on Monday and said that the president should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clear the table\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d by doing whatever he can administratively so small issues do not get in the way of the bigger legislative fights over access to guns.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow a side issue to derail these things,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Emanuel said during a discussion about gun policy. While many gun control advocates are eager to harness what they believe is a ripe moment in American life for new and robust restrictions on the kinds of guns that were used in Newtown, there is an emerging consensus on Capitol Hill and among gun education groups that improving the system of background check legislation that currently exempts private gun sales and gun shows is the most viable legislative route to pursue.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The assault-weapons ban is a low priority relative to the other measures the Biden task force is considering,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Matt Bennett, a spokesman for Third Way, a left-leaning research group, said after hearing from Mr. Biden last week. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Political capital in the gun debate only goes so far. We think it should be spent on things that would have the greatest impact on gun violence, like universal background checks and cracking down on gun trafficking.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Any efforts to get gun legislation through Congress will require an enormous and ceaseless pressure campaign by the administration. Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden are likely to keep up the pressure on lawmakers with public events in the weeks and months ahead, according to those familiar with the White House strategy.\n Scores of senators, including many Democrats, will be wary of voting on any effort to curb access to guns or ammunition. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, is a longtime supporter of gun rights. Still, gun legislation is likely to begin in the Senate because the House is controlled by Republicans, many of whom oppose new restrictions on guns.\n With fiscal issues continuing to dominate the political calendar for the next several weeks, White House officials and lawmakers say the gun safety effort is likely to be debated in separate pieces of legislation that could be introduced over time. In coming weeks, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, will reintroduce a measure that would require every gun buyer, with limited exceptions, to undergo a background check and would force states to feed all relevant data into the background check system so those with criminal convictions and the mentally ill could be flagged.\n",

Petraeus, then the director of the C.I.A., and his deputy, Michael J. Morell, over how much to disclose in the talking points, which were used by Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations, in television appearances days after the attack.\n Mr. Morell, administration officials said, deleted a reference in the draft version of the talking points to C.I.A. warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials objected to because they feared it would reflect badly on them.\n Mr. Morell, officials said, acted on his own and not in response to pressure from the State Department. But when the final draft of the talking points was sent to Mr. Petraeus, he dismissed them, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Frankly, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d just as soon not use this,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d adding that the heavily scrubbed account would not satisfy the House Democrat who had requested it.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is certainly not what Vice Chairman Ruppersberger was hoping to get,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Petraeus wrote, referring to Representative C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which had asked Mr. Petraeus for talking points to use with reporters in discussing the attack on Benghazi.\n The White House released the e-mails to reporters after Republicans seized on snippets of the correspondence that became public on Friday to suggest that President Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national security staff had been complicit in trying to alter the talking points for political reasons.\n While the e-mails portrayed White House officials as being sensitive to the concerns of the State Department, they suggest that Mr. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aides mostly mediated a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and the C.I.A. over how much to disclose \u00e2\u20ac\u201d all under heavy time constraints because of the demands from Capitol Hill. The e-mails revealed no new details about the administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evolving account of the Sept. 11 attack, which killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In recent days, these e-mails have been selectively and inaccurately read out to the media,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said a White House spokesman, Eric Schultz. By releasing them, he said, the White House had shown that the drafting process was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153focused on providing the facts as we knew them, based on the best information available at the time and protecting an ongoing investigation.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Still, the final version of the talking points is stripped of material \u00e2\u20ac\u201d including a reference to Libya being awash with weapons and fighters that made it a dangerous environment \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which critics say would have raised questions about the State Department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security posture.\n Republicans welcomed the release of the e-mails, saying they confirmed that the administration had airbrushed its account of the attack during an election campaign. They also said the e-mails belied the White House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insistence that it had changed only one word in the talking points.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The seemingly political nature of the State Department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns raises questions about the motivations behind these changes and who at the State Department was seeking them,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner.\n In releasing the e-mails, the White House was hoping to show that intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the debate over the talking points. It drew attention to a draft of the talking points \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the only document provided by the White House that was not part of an e-mail chain \u00e2\u20ac\u201d in which Mr. Morell, in his own writing, crossed out five lines that referred to C.I.A. warnings about the threat of attacks by Al Qaeda-linked extremists in Benghazi and eastern Libya.\n But there is no other evidence in the e-mails that Mr. Morell himself objected to the inclusion of this material. In an e-mail to Mr. Petraeus accompanying the final version of the talking points, Mr. Morell referred to the State Department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deep concerns about the references.\n The release of the e-mails offers a rare glimpse inside the White House five days after the attack as it struggled to piece together intelligence to formulate a public account of what happened.\n The process began in earnest at 4:20 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 14, when Stephen W. Preston, the C.I.A. general counsel, sent an e-mail to other agency officials warning them not to disclose information that might interfere with the F.B.I.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation.\n At 6:20 p.m., the spokesman for the National Security Council at the time, Tommy Vietor, e-mailed to remind officials that Denis McDonough, then the deputy national security adviser and now the White House chief of staff, wanted to ensure that the edits were coordinated with the State Department.\n At 6:41 p.m., Shawn Turner, the spokesman for the director of national intelligence, suggested saying that on Sept. 10, the C.I.A. had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153notified\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the American embassy in Cairo, not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153warned\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d it, of social media reports calling for a demonstration and encouraging jihadists to break into the embassy. Mr. Morell later removed the entire reference.\n At 7:16 p.m., Victoria Nuland, the State Department spokeswoman, weighed in with her initial concerns about ensuring that the talking points provided to lawmakers did not go further than what the administration was telling reporters.\n Twenty-three minutes later, Ms. Nuland sent White House and intelligence officials an even more pointed e-mail, objecting that the talking points could be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153abused\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d by lawmakers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to beat the State Department for not paying attention to agency warnings so why do we want to feed that either? Concerned ... \u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n At 7:51 p.m., the F.B.I. offered only minor changes to the draft, the bureau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only suggestions during the contentious process.\n At 9:24 p.m., Ms. Nuland, reading the latest draft, complained in an e-mail, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resolve all my issues or those of my building leadership.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ten minutes later, Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, offered his first comments, saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to resolve this in a way that respects all of the relevant equities, especially the investigation.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In a report that set off the latest tempest over the talking points, ABC News reported incorrectly that Mr. Rhodes had emphasized the need to protect the State Department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interests.\n At 9:52 p.m., a C.I.A. spokesman e-mailed to other agency staff members a draft note intended for Mr. Petraeus, warning him that while the White House had quickly cleared the proposed talking points, the State Department had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153major concerns.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national security deputies reviewed the talking points at a meeting the next day, Sept. 15, Mr. Rhodes said.\n At 11:25 a.m., Mr. Rhodes changed a reference to the United States \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consulate\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d in Benghazi to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153diplomatic post.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Over the next couple of hours, aides made small final changes and e-mailed a final version to lawmakers shortly after 3 p.m.\n With time short before Ms. Rice began taping her appearances on Sunday morning news programs, the White House also supplied her aides with the final talking points.\n Asked by one of Ms. Rice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aides, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is this the final language you want to use on Benghazi,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Rhodes replied with a single word: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yup.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, conceded for the first time that the Prism program existed. But in a statement, after denouncing the leak of the data to The Guardian and The Washington Post, Mr. Clapper insisted it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not an undisclosed collection or data mining program.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Instead, he said it was a computer system to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153facilitate\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the collection of foreign intelligence that had been authorized by Congress.\n Mr. Clapper also insisted that the government \u00e2\u20ac\u0153does not unilaterally obtain information from the servers\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d of telephone and Internet providers, saying that information is turned over only under court order, when there is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153documented, foreign intelligence purpose for acquisition\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d of the data.\n He appeared to be attempting to push back against early reports that the government had direct access to the huge computer servers at Google, Microsoft, Facebook and similar companies. Those firms have denied they give the government a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153back door\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d to their systems.\n But they acknowledge handing over material when ordered to do so by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, though they have not described the mechanism for complying with those orders. It appears the companies use some kind of electronic drop box, in which they place the material, so that the government can then harvest the information.\n The national intelligence director\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rare Saturday statement was notable for what it omitted: any description of other means the government may use to intercept Internet information directly from fiber optic cables or satellite systems even before or after it reaches those Internet companies.\n A new report in The Guardian, published online on Saturday, cited another document that showed that in March 2013 there were 97 billion pieces of data collected from networks worldwide; about 14 percent of it was from Iran, much was from Pakistan and about 3 percent came from inside the United States, though some of that may have been foreign data traffic routed through American-based servers.\n Meanwhile, senior Obama administration officials, including the directors of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and of national intelligence, have held 13 classified hearings and briefings for members of Congress since 2009 to explain the broad authority they say they have to sweep up electronic records for national security purposes, a senior administration official said Saturday.\n The administration, by disclosing the briefings, sought to push back on claims by Democrats and Republicans in Congress that they were either not aware of programs to mine vast amounts of Internet data and business telephone records or were insufficiently briefed on the details.\n Lawmakers said that what they knew was vague and broad \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and that strict rules of classification prevented them from truly debating the programs or conducting proper oversight.\n In separate but identical letters sent on Oct. 19, 2011, Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich told two of Congress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most outspoken critics of the efforts, Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado, both Democrats, that in December 2009 and February 2011 the Justice Department and intelligence agencies provided a classified document to Congress describing the surveillance efforts in detail.\n The letter said the House and Senate Intelligence Committees had been briefed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on these operations multiple times and have had access to copies of the classified\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d orders and opinions of the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Members of the committee were invited to share the information with other lawmakers.\n Broader briefings were held in 2011 before the reauthorization of the Patriot Act, the post-Sept. 11 law that authorized much of the surveillance.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Against this backdrop, we do not believe the executive branch is operating pursuant to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsecret law\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsecret opinions of the Department of Justice,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Weich wrote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rather, the intelligence community is conducting court-authorized intelligence activities pursuant to a public statute, with the knowledge and oversight of Congress and the Intelligence Committees of both houses.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n On Friday, Mr. Udall and Mr. Wyden released a joint statement repeating that they had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153long been concerned about the degree to which this collection has relied on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsecret law.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Senior administration officials have stated on multiple occasions that the Patriot Act\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbusiness records\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 authority is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcanalogous to a grand jury subpoena,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\\x9d they said. They added that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153multiple senior officials have stated that U.S. intelligence agencies do not collect information or dossiers on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmillions of Americans,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\\x9d assertions that they believe have been contradicted by revelations of Internet data mining and a court order asking a Verizon subsidiary to turn over logs of telephone calls.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now that the fact of bulk collection has been declassified, we believe that more information about the scale of the collection, and specifically whether it involves the records of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmillions of Americans,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 should be declassified as well,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d they said.\n The list of briefings begins on May 12, 2009, with a classified hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee involving Gen. Keith B. Alexander, the head of the United States Cyber Command, and David S. Kris, assistant attorney general for national security.\n On Feb. 14, 2011, all senators were offered the opportunity to discuss the broad authority under the Patriot Act with the director of national intelligence, Mr. Clapper; the F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III; and General Alexander. Mr. Mueller spoke to the House Republican Conference on May 13, 2011, and to the House Democratic Caucus on May 24, 2011.\n On Feb. 8, 2011, Senators Dianne Feinstein of California, the chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee, and Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, the ranking Republican on the panel, invited every senator to a briefing with Mr. Clapper and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to discuss expiring provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.\n The provisions \u00e2\u20ac\u201d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one on roving authority for electronic surveillance and the other on the acquisition of business records that are relevant to investigations to protect against international terrorism or espionage\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d \u00e2\u20ac\u201d were added to the 1978 law by the Patriot Act.\n But Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Senate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s No. 2 Democrat, draws a distinction between the holding of such briefings and the informed consent of Congress. Very few lawmakers avail themselves of such briefings, he suggested, and only the most senior leaders are kept fully abreast of intelligence activities.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can count on two hands the number of people in Congress who really know,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said in an interview on Friday.\n",

According to the excerpts, she argued that the administration should not give Congress ammunition to \"beat up\" on her department.\n During a press conference Monday, President Obama even acknowledged that the country now knows that \"clearly (the staff in Benghazi) were not in a position where they were adequately protected.\"\n A review of now-public State Department records as well as a classified State Department cable, first reviewed and reported by Fox News, shows a steady stream of documented warnings to Washington from intelligence and State security officials on the ground in Libya that the Islamist threat was severe and growing.\n One of the most significant warnings was an August 2012 State Department classified cable, which has not been made public, that summarized an emergency meeting in Benghazi where the CIA briefed on the significant threat of terrorist activity.\n The cable, sent under Ambassador Chris Stevens' signature and marked SECRET, warned the office of Secretary of State Clinton that the CIA advised \"ten Islamist militias and AQ training camps (were) within Benghazi.\"\n The cable also warned that the 17 February Brigade, the group charged with protecting the consulate, appeared to be compromised. It said \"requests to provide a daily police presence have gone unanswered,\" adding there was also a \"lack of host nation security support to the US mission.\"\n In addition to identifying the presence of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi, the groups ultimately blamed for the assault, a key section of the cable, which remains classified, seemed to foreshadow the attack itself.\n \"RSO (Regional Security Officer) expressed concerns with the ability to defend Post in the event of a coordinated attack due to limited manpower, security measures, weapons capabilities, host nation support, and the overall size of the compound,\" it said.\n During congressional hearings in January, Clinton was asked whether she had seen the cable by Republican Rep. Michael McCaul. Clinton said she had no knowledge of the warning which former diplomatic security agents have told Fox News amounted to a \"cry for help.\"\n \"Congressman, that cable did not come to my attention,\" Clinton testified before the House Foreign Affairs committee. \"I have made it very clear that the security cable did not come to my attention or above the assistant secretary level where the ARB (Accountability Review Board) placed responsibility where, as I think, Ambassador Pickering said the rubber hit the road.\"\n In February, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham followed up on the classified cable.\n After the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed he knew about the cable which summarized the August emergency meeting in Benghazi, Graham questioned why the military was read in when Clinton apparently was not.\n Gen. Martin Dempsey responded: \"Well, I don't know that she didn't know about the cable.\"\n Graham said: \"She said she didn't. Are you stunned that she didn't?\"\n Dempsey said: \"I would call myself surprised that she didn't.\"\n In addition to attacks in Benghazi on the British ambassador -- which forced the temporary closure of the U.K. operation -- the International Red Cross and United Nations, in the summer of 2012 the group Ansar al-Sharia was so well-established it held an annual conference in Benghazi to promote Islamic law.\n Records released by the House oversight committee, including a report from the regional security officer, also documented more than 200 cases of violence in Libya in the year leading up to the attack, specifically between June 2011 and July 2012. Another security review, on June 25, 2012, reported a spike in violence with \"foreigners also increasingly targeted.\"\n While much has been made of the State Department's failure to respond to repeated security requests for extra help, a former diplomatic security agent and 20-year veteran of the department, who reviewed the publicly available documents on the condition of anonymity, told Fox News the multiple warnings present a compelling argument that State Department leadership was negligent.\n The State Department, in a document put out last week, noted that while an internal review found certain senior officials \"demonstrated a lack of proactive leadership and management ability\" in response to security concerns, there was no specific finding of misconduct.\n",

James Risch (R-Idaho) at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \"And I say that because in the unclassified ARB, it is -- I quote: 'Key questions surrounding the identity, actions and motivations of the perpetrators remain to be determined.'\"\n The question of what motivated the Benghazi attacks has often been viewed as a duality: Either it was the result of a mob angry over a recently released anti-Islamic video, or it was a terrorist attack.\n That the administration wavered over its public declarations of the cause of the assault -- repeatedly citing the video before eventually confirming that it was clearly an act of terrorism -- was widely interpreted among critics as evidence of a desire to suppress or conceal the truth.\n But from the start, the evidence on the scene in Benghazi was more complex.\n Reporters from The New York Times and Reuters who were on the ground immediately after the attacks relayed that people involved in the mob scene around the compound repeatedly cited the video as a cause of their anger.\n The Times later stood by that version of events, citing it in its fact-check of Republican attacks on Obama during the presidential campaign.\n The ARB, in its unclassified form, mentions that the attackers' motivation is the subject of an ongoing FBI investigation. But the classified version, Clinton said, detailed the possible motivations for the attack, and suggested while they were pre-coordinated and deliberate, they were also opportunistic and not planned extensively.\n In citing the classified report to rebuff congressional queries about the administration's handling of the crisis, Clinton was drawing on a powerful tool of her office, although discussing a classified document is sure to raise further questions.\n The added complexity wasn't always satisfying to the legislators who grilled her Wednesday.\n While being questioned at the House Foreign Relations Committee by Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), Clinton urged that he read the classified ARB report to find his answers.\n \"There are key questions surrounding the identity, actions and motivations of the perpetrators that remain to be determined,\" she said. \"I recommend that every member read the classified version, which goes into greater detail that I cannot speak to here today.\n To which Duncan replied: \"It was a terrorist attack. It's pretty clear what the motivation was.\"\n",

Deval Patrick on Wednesday picked a former chief of staff to fill Sen. John Kerry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open seat until a special election in June.\n The Democratic governor picked former Chief of Staff William \"Mo\" Cowan, who also served as Patrick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief legal counsel.\n Kerry, also a Democrat and the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior U.S. senator, was confirmed Tuesday as the new secretary of state, following his nomination by President Obama to replace the retiring Hillary Clinton.\n Both political parties will hold special-election primaries in mid May. But the winner of the Democratic primary will be a likely favorite to win the June 25 special general election, considering Massachusetts is among the most liberal states in the country. Patrick also announced the general election date Wednesday.\n Among the potential Democratic candidates are Reps. Stephen F. Lynch, Michael E. Capuano and Edward Markey.\n The most high-profile potential Republican candidate is former Sen. Scott Brown, who pulled off a surprise 2010 victory in the race for the open seat of Sen. Ted Kennedy. However, Brown lost his re-election bid in November to Democrat Elizabeth Warren.\n Cowan joined the Patrick administration in 2009 and reportedly quit earlier this month to join private practice. He previously practiced civil litigation at the Boston office of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo PC, where he was a partner. He also was a special assistant district attorney in the Office of the Middlesex County District Attorney.\n Cowan is a graduate of Duke University and Northeastern University School of Law. He and wife Stacy have two young sons.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am confident this is the right and best choice,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Patrick said at a late-morning press conference.\n The appointment marks the first time in Senate history that two black senators have served at the same time.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not standing here because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a person of color, but because (the governor) believes I can do the job,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Cowen, who joins South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott as the chamber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two black senators.\n Cowmen also emphasized that his assignment is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153temporary\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and that he will work together with Kerry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team.\n Patrick gave little indication who he favored during his deliberations.\n The only possible candidate he confirmed speaking with was former Democratic Rep. Barney Frank, and then only after Frank told reporters he'd spoken with Patrick.\n Michael Dukakis, the former governor and 1988 Democratic presidential nominee, and Victoria Kennedy, Sen. Kennedy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s widow, had also been mentioned as possible candidates for the interim post.\n",

The president, speaking at the White House, said he would use \"whatever weight this office holds\" to get the proposals passed.\n \"If there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try,\" Obama said. \"When it comes to protecting the most vulnerable among us, we must act now. ... Let's do the right thing.\"\n The president was joined by four children who wrote to the White House about gun violence following the Connecticut mass shooting in which 20 children were killed. Though the administration faced some criticism for involving children in the program, they were positioned off to the side while Obama spoke.\n Despite discussions earlier about addressing the pervasive violence in the entertainment and video game industries, the president's plan did not address those issues in depth. The plan, though, does call for a range of measures to improve access to mental health services and improve safety at America's schools.\n The president, immediately after making his remarks, signed nearly two-dozen executive actions -- a step that has stirred objections from lawmakers who have warned Obama not to overstep his bounds.\n Unilaterally, Obama on Wednesday directed federal agencies to share information with the federal background check system; proposed new rules to let law enforcement run full background checks before returning a seized gun; ordered the Centers for Disease Control to research causes of gun violence; required law enforcement to trace guns from criminal investigations; and took other steps. Plus Obama is nominating ATF Acting Director Todd Jones to officially lead the agency\n The most controversial elements of the president's plan, though, continue to be the proposals he wants Congress to pass.\n The call for universal background checks would extend to gun shows and private sales, with \"limited\" exemptions for \"certain transfers\" among family members and other situations. The administration plans to give private sellers guidance on how to run background checks as soon as possible.\n Plus the president wants to commit $4 billion to hiring more police officers, and to pass new gun trafficking laws to explicitly prohibit straw purchasing.\n The plan was already earning a mixed response from lawmakers.\n Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., accused Obama of trying to \"undermine Americans' constitutional right to bear arms\" without doing enough to focus on keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.\n \"Nothing the president is proposing would have stopped the massacre at Sandy Hook. President Obama is targeting the 2nd Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens instead of seriously addressing the real underlying causes of such violence,\" he said.\n Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said \"all options should be on the table.\"\n Texas Gov. Rick Perry, in a written statement, said: \"Guns require a finger to pull the trigger. The sad young man who did that in Newtown was clearly haunted by demons and no gun law could have saved the children in Sandy Hook Elementary from his terror.\"\n Gun-rights groups say the effort to impose more gun control measures is misguided, noting in particular that most killings in America are committed with handguns and not the assault weapons the administration intends to target. Some local officials have vowed to resist federal action.\n The National Rifle Association also plans to launch a major ad campaign. The group's first ad called Obama an \"elitist hypocrite\" for his daughters' security detail. Obama has been critical of the NRA's plan to install armed security in every school.\n The White House plan does address school security, urging Congress to help schools complete emergency plans; proposing an initiative to help schools hire up to 1,000 resource officers and mental health professionals; and proposing new training for teachers to recognize mental health issues among young people. Obama also plans to beef up mental health coverage via executive action.\n House Speaker John Boehner declined to weigh in on the merits of the president's proposals Wednesday.\n \"House committees of jurisdiction will review these recommendations. And if the Senate passes a bill, we will also take a look at that,\" Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said.\n",

Deval Patrick on Wednesday appointed William Cowan, a Boston lawyer who is a longtime friend and former aide, to serve as an interim United States senator until voters chose a successor to John Kerry in a special election set for June 25.\n Mr. Cowan, 43, who is known as Mo, is a former partner in the politically connected law firm of Mintz Levin and will become Massachusetts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 first black senator since Edward Brooke, a Republican, held the seat from 1966 to 1978. His appointment makes Mr. Cowan the second black member to be seated in the current Senate, after Tim Scott of South Carolina was appointed by Gov. Nikki R. Haley.\n Mr. Patrick had said he wanted to appoint someone who did not want to run for the seat later because that person would have to conduct a campaign while learning the ropes in the Senate, and would be unlikely to do either job well. At a packed news conference at the State House, Mr. Cowan said he would not seek the permanent office or use the appointment as a springboard later. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is going to be a very short political career,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he vowed.\n The clock is now ticking toward the special election. It promises to be another bruising campaign, with two Democratic congressmen likely to face off in a primary in April.\n The biggest question remaining in this drawn-out episode, which began last fall when Mr. Kerry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name surfaced as a possible successor to Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state, is whether former Senator Scott P. Brown, a Republican, will jump in.\n Mr. Brown has remained mum on the subject, and his camp has sent few signals about his intentions, but he may find the opportunity hard to resist.\n Polls show him beating Representative Edward J. Markey, the only Democrat who has officially declared his candidacy. Mr. Brown has high name recognition and money left over from his unsuccessful race last year against Elizabeth Warren.\n If he entered the race and won, Mr. Brown would be in the awkward position of becoming the junior senator to Ms. Warren, even though she has been in office only a few weeks. The Senate historian said that those who return to the Senate after leaving \u00e2\u20ac\u201d like Dan Coats of Indiana and Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, for example \u00e2\u20ac\u201d lose their seniority, although the distinction has little meaning beyond a way to refer to a state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senators in the formal oratory of the Senate floor.\n Still, it would be unusual for a state to have two senators who had run against each other, especially in a race that was particularly hard fought.\n The June 25 special election would be Mr. Brown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third statewide Senate race in three years, starting with his win in a special election in January 2010 to finish Senator Edward M. Kennedy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s term. If he won, he would presumably run in 2014 for a full six-year term \u00e2\u20ac\u201d or four statewide races in nearly five years.\n So far, the only Democrat in the race is Mr. Markey, 66, a liberal and dean of the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Congressional delegation. Several Democrats, including Mr. Kerry, have closed ranks behind him in the hopes of discouraging anyone else from getting in and avoiding a bruising primary.\n But Representative Stephen F. Lynch, a conservative Democrat from South Boston, is expected to announce Thursday that he will challenge Mr. Markey. The primary would be held on April 30.\n The rough and tumble of the coming campaign seemed far away at Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news conference, which was attended by Mr. Cowan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wife, Stacey, and their two young sons.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cool,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Lt. Gov. Timothy Murray said of Mr. Cowan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tom Brady, George Clooney, James Bond and the president have nothing on Mo.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Cowan, who usually wears a bow tie but opted not to for this occasion, is a former chief of staff and chief legal counsel to Mr. Patrick, the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first black governor. From 1997 to 2009, he practiced civil litigation as an associate and later a partner in the Boston office of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky & Popeo. He also served as a special assistant district attorney in Middlesex County. He left the Patrick administration last year to return to the private sector, but said this brief detour to Washington was a sacrifice worth making because he wanted to give something back to the state that had given him so much.\n Mr. Cowan said at the news conference that he was proud to take the post, noting that his mother, who was home in North Carolina recovering from knee surgery, was a child of the segregated South and had not attended college. The death of Mr. Cowan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s father at a young age left her to raise her children alone.\n Despite her hardships, he said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My mother told me that days like this were possible.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He seemed to be a quick study in the senatorial art of not answering questions definitively. Asked, for example, if he would vote for military cuts if they cost jobs in Massachusetts, he called for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a balanced approach,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d with some cuts and some revenue growth.\n Mr. Patrick showed similar deftness, skirting a question about why he had not picked former Representative Barney Frank, who had asserted that he would have loved the interim appointment.\n Mr. Cowan said that he would be relying on Mr. Kerry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff in Washington and in Massachusetts for guidance and that he intended to continue Mr. Kerry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be any daylight there at all,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n Mr. Patrick, who has served as a mentor to Mr. Cowan, was asked whether he saw some of himself in Mr. Cowan.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not that cool,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the governor replied.\n",

Jackson Jr., the former Democratic representative from Illinois, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to one felony fraud count in connection with his use of $750,000 in campaign money to pay for living expenses and buy items like stuffed animals, elk heads and fur capes.\n As part of a plea agreement, prosecutors recommended that Mr. Jackson receive a sentence of 46 to 57 months in prison. The federal judge overseeing the case, Robert L. Wilkins, is scheduled to sentence Mr. Jackson on June 28.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For years I lived off my campaign,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Jackson, 47, said in response to questions from the judge about the plea. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I used money I shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have used for personal purposes.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n At one point during the hearing, the judge stopped his questioning of Mr. Jackson, who was crying, so that he could be given a tissue.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Guilty, Your Honor \u00e2\u20ac\u201d I misled the American people,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Jackson said when asked whether he would accept the plea deal. Mr. Jackson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s father, the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, his mother and several brothers and sisters accompanied him to the hearing.\n Mr. Jackson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wife, Sandi, also accompanied him, and later in the day she pleaded guilty to a charge that she filed false income tax statements during the time that Mr. Jackson was dipping into his campaign treasury. Prosecutors said they would seek to have her sentenced to 18 to 24 months.\n Mr. Jackson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plea was yet another chapter in the downward spiral of his career. Elected to Congress in 1995 at the age of 30 from a district that includes part of the South Side of Chicago, Mr. Jackson was once one of the most prominent young black politicians in the country, working on issues related to health care and education for the poor.\n But as the federal authorities investigated Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois over his efforts to sell the Senate seat that President Obama vacated in 2008, they uncovered evidence that one of Mr. Jackson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s friends had offered to make a contribution to Mr. Blagojevich\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign in exchange for the seat. Since then, Mr. Jackson, who has said he had no knowledge of the offer, has been dogged by questions about his ethics.\n Last summer, Mr. Jackson took a medical leave from Congress and was later treated for bipolar disorder. After winning re-election in November, he resigned, citing his health and the federal investigation into his use of campaign money.\n After the hearing, Mr. Jackson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyer, Reid H. Weingarten, said his client had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153come to terms with his misconduct.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Weingarten said that Mr. Jackson had serious health issues that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153directly related\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d to his conduct.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not an excuse, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a fact,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Weingarten said.\n Court papers released by federal prosecutors on Wednesday provided new details about how Mr. Jackson and his wife used the $750,000 in campaign money to finance their lavish lifestyle.\n From 2007 to 2011, Mr. Jackson bought $10,977.74 worth of televisions, DVD players and DVDs at Best Buy, according to the documents. In 2008, Mr. Jackson used the money for things like a $466.30 dinner at CityZen in the Mandarin Oriental in Washington and a $5,587.75 vacation at the Martha\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vineyard Holistic Retreat, the document said.\n On at least two instances, Mr. Jackson and his wife used campaign money at Build-A-Bear Workshop, a store where patrons can create stuffed animals. From December 2007 through December 2008, the Jacksons spent $313.89 on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stuffed animals and accessories for stuffed animals\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d from Build-A-Bear, according to the documents.\n One of the more exotic items they bought was an elk head from a taxidermist in Montana. According to the documents, Mr. Jackson arranged in March 2011 to have $7,000 paid to the taxidermist, with much of the money coming from a campaign account, and it was shipped a month later to Mr. Jackson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Congressional office.\n A year later, Mr. Jackson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wife, knowing that the elk head had been bought with campaign money, had it moved from Washington to Chicago, and she asked a Congressional staff member to sell it, the documents say.\n In August 2012, the staff member sold the elk head for $5,300 to an interior designer and had the money wired to one of Mr. Jackson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accounts. What the staff member did not know was that the interior designer was actually an undercover F.B.I. employee who was investigating the Jacksons, the documents say.\n Documents released on Friday showed how Mr. Jackson used his campaign money to buy items like fur capes, celebrity memorabilia and expensive furniture.\n Among those items were a $5,000 football signed by American presidents and two hats that once belonged to Michael Jackson, including a $4,600 fedora.\n",

The Treasury Department answered some of those questions on Thursday. As of the 2013 tax year, same-sex spouses who are legally married will not be able to file federal tax returns as if either were single. Instead, they must file together as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153married filing jointly\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d or individually as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153married filing separately.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Their address or the location of their wedding does not matter, as long as the marriage is legal: a same-sex couple who marry in Albany, N.Y., and move to Alabama are treated the same as a same-sex couple who marry and live in Massachusetts.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling provides certainty and clear, coherent tax-filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This ruling also assures legally married same-sex couples that they can move freely throughout the country knowing that their federal filing status will not change.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Gay and civil rights groups praised the ruling. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under our nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s federal tax laws, regardless of what state they call home,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Chad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These families finally have access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But the Treasury decision could have ramifications for many gay couples\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tax liabilities, said Roberton Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington. Couples with similar incomes often pay the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153marriage penalty,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d with their tax liability as a couple being much higher than it would be if they were single.\n At the same time, same-sex couples will also be able to file amended returns for certain prior tax years, meaning that many couples might be eligible for refunds. Couples do not have to file amended returns if they do not want to, a senior Treasury official said, meaning that couples who might pay the marriage penalty would not owe back taxes.\n But the ruling creates complications for same-sex couples who live in any of the 37 states that do not recognize their marriages. Previously, such couples filed federal and state tax returns as individuals. Now, they will have to file their federal returns as other married couples do, but may be required to file their state returns as individuals.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a cumbersome workaround,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Nanette Lee Miller of Marcum L.L.P., a public accounting firm. She sees it as a paperwork bother more than a financial issue.\n States might also respond to the federal ruling with changes of their own. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most state income tax regimes begin with federal taxable income as the starting point,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Marvin Kirsner, a tax lawyer at Greenberg Traurig, said in an e-mail. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These state taxing authorities will have to figure out how to deal with a same-sex married couple who file a joint income tax return for federal tax purposes.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d He added,\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will need to see guidance from each nonrecognition state to see how this will be handled.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The rule change is likely to provide a small increase for federal revenue, as more same-sex couples pay the marriage penalty, Mr. Williams said, describing it as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rounding error.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d But it would be partly offset by new federal spending on benefits for same-sex spouses.\n The ruling applies to all legal marriages made in the United States or foreign countries. But it does not extend to civil unions, registered domestic partnerships or other legal relationships, the Treasury said.\n The Treasury ruling is one of many that are starting to emerge from all corners of the federal government as Washington changes regulations to conform with the Supreme Court decision.\n Separately, the Health and Human Services Department said Thursday that Medicare would extend certain key benefits to same-sex spouses, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clarifying that all beneficiaries in private Medicare plans have access to equal coverage when it comes to care in a nursing home where their spouse lives.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But federal agencies are not moving in lock step. Instead, they are creating a patchwork of regulations affecting gay and lesbian couples \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and may be raising questions about discrimination and fairness in the way that federal benefits are distributed.\n Medicare and Treasury officials have said they would use a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153place of celebration\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d standard for determining whether gay couples are eligible for benefits. That means same-sex couples would receive benefits as long as they are legally married, regardless of where they live.\n But the Social Security Administration is now using a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153place of residence\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d standard in determining spousal benefits, and a gay couple in Alabama might not receive the same benefits as a gay couple in New York until final determinations are made or Congress acts. The Obama administration has pushed federal agencies to ensure the Supreme Court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling is carried out quickly and smoothly.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would be nice if they were consistent,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ms. Miller said. Creating federal regulations is a process and could change, she said.\n",

The ruling allows homosexual couples to receive the same tax benefits that heterosexual couples do when filing jointly.\n Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement comes on the heels of a historic decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which overturned a part of the Defense of Marriage Act earlier this year.\n Questions were raised following the high court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision on how the federal government would treat same-sex couples whose home states don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recognize gay marriage.\n The rules issued Thursday said the policies would affect all legally married gay couples regardless of where they live. The rules, though, would not apply to domestic partnerships and civil unions.\n \"Today's ruling provides certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide. It provides access to benefits, responsibilities and protections under federal tax law that all Americans deserve,\" Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said in a written statement.\n Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said that, because of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under our nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s federal tax laws, regardless of what state they call home.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He added, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These families finally have access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Not everyone was on board with the decision.\n Brian Brown, president of the National Organization of Marriage, believes that giving same sex couples the right to file jointly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continues a pattern of lawlessness\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d across the country.\n \"The Obama administration is intent on forcing same-sex 'marriage' on an unwilling public,\" Brown said in a written statement. \"Congress alone has the responsibility of determining federal tax law.\"\n",

This is how we will be judged,\" Obama said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put this off any longer.\"\n The proposal, which comes at the end of a month-long review process spearheaded by Vice President Joe Biden, is broken down into four key subsections: law enforcement, the availability of dangerous firearms and ammunition, school safety and mental health.\n In an effort to touch on all four of those elements, the president recommended requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales; reinstating the assault weapons ban; restoring a 10-round limit on ammunition magazines; eliminating armor-piercing bullets; providing mental health services in schools; allocating funds to hire more police officers; and instituting a federal gun trafficking statute, among other policies. The cost of the package, senior officials estimated, would be roughly $500 million, some of which could come from already budgeted funds.\n Because these recommendations require congressional approval, the administration is supplementing its proposal with 23 executive actions that will be taken immediately. Those actions include requiring federal agencies to hand over relevant data for a background check system; providing law enforcement officials, first responders and school officials with better training for active shooting situations; directing the Centers for Disease Control to research the causes and prevention of gun violence; and many more.\n \"I intend to use whatever weight this office holds to make them a reality,\" said the president, speaking about his full set of recommendations. \"If there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try.\"\n The approach is so sweeping that what would have otherwise been a headline-grabbing announcement received second billing. The president on Wednesday will nominate Byron Todd Jones, the acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to take over the post permanently.\n In total, the proposal goes beyond what most gun control advocates were hoping for at the start of Biden's review process, during which he held 22 different meetings with 229 different organizations and 31 elected officials.\n \"This is a monumental moment. It's a long time coming and we're thrilled the president's putting the full weight of his office behind this,\" said Josh Horowitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. \"We're ready to push this thing through.\"\n But putting together ideas is the easy part. Selling them on the Hill will take a bit of legislative craft.\n Seasoned political observers have questioned whether it makes more sense to break the package into separate bills or push for one comprehensive proposal. A senior administration official said that the president's proposal shouldn't be considered finalized legislative language, but rather a series of recommendations for Congress to consider. The president would be working with lawmakers to move the process forward, the official added, and would be trying to build up public opinion as well.\n \"I will put everything I've got into this and so will Joe [Biden]. But I tell you, the only way we can change is if the American people demand it,\" said Obama. \"We are going to need voices in those areas and congressional districts where the tradition of gun ownership is strong.\"\n \"It can't just be the usual suspects,\" he continued. \"This will not happen unless the American people demand it.\"\n The gun-rights lobby has already signaled that it will try to block the administration's effort. A spokesman for the National Rifle Association did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the president's proposal. But the organization has already harshly criticized the Obama administration for overreach.\n \"It is unfortunate that this administration continues to insist on pushing failed solutions to our nation's most pressing problems,\" the NRA said after meeting with Biden last week. \"We will not allow law-abiding gun owners to be blamed for the acts of criminals and madmen.\"\n The group continued its offensive this week, launching an advertising campaign attacking Obama as an \"elitist hypocrite\" for opposing the NRA's widely-criticized proposal, made after the Newtown, Conn. shooting, to place armed guards in all of the nation's schools.\n But that attack appeared a bit premature. As part of its policy recommendations, the White House called on Congress to act on an old administration proposal to spend $4 billion to keep 15,000 cops on the streets. In addition, the president is proposing a new initiative that would incentivize police departments to hire more school resource officers and encourage schools to hire more mental health professionals. The president's plan also calls on Congress to allocate resources to help schools, other educational institutions and houses of worship develop emergency management plans.\n The White House proposals, even officials there admit, are not a cure-all for mass shootings. Among the suggested recommendations on the gun-policy front, only the ban on high-capacity magazines could have had a tangible impact on the shooting in Newtown, and it's unclear what, exactly, the effect would have been.\n Moreover, the administration is pointedly not going after those weapons and ammunition magazines that are currently and lawfully owned. The proposal would instead affect the future production and sale of military-style weapons or high-capacity magazines.\n \"We are not going to go after existing stock of weapons or magazines,\" said a senior administration official. \"We are going to limit it to the manufacturing of assault weapons and clips going forward.\"\n The White House nevertheless insists that its package of proposals has teeth. It would provide law enforcement with the mechanisms needed to go after the illegal transfer of weapons and help prevent those weapons from falling into the wrong hands. It would also stem the use of military-style weapons -- the White House says its proposal would improve on the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, which was riddled with loopholes -- and give schools and communities resources to address violence when it occurs.\n The question, in some respects, is not what's missing from the set of ideas, but what took the administration so long to get to this point.\n \"It is not as though we had this whole policy paper sitting on the shelf somewhere,\" said a senior administration official. \"[We worked] 24/7 for the past month. And we met with a lot of groups and we learned a lot of ideas that came as a result of this process. We tried to be as comprehensive as possible. We are hoping that as the process goes on and as the debate goes on, we might come up with some other ideas.\"\n",

Deval Patrick (D) on Wednesday appointed William \"Mo\" Cowan to the Senate seat vacated by newly confirmed Secretary of State John Kerry. Cowan will hold the seat in an interim capacity until an election in June.\n Patrick, Cowan and Lt. Governor Tim Murray were all smiles as they walked into a news conference to announce the appointment.\n \"He's cool,\" Murray said of Cowan. \"Tom Brady, George Clooney, James Bond, the president have nothing on Mo.\"\n \"It was a private fact, but now known publicly thanks to the lieutenant governor, that he also brought cool,\" Patrick said to laughs. He and Cowan shook hands and hugged.\n Cowan, 43, is a former chief of staff and former legal counsel to Patrick. Like Patrick, who grew up on the South Side of Chicago before attending Milton Academy, Harvard and Harvard Law, Cowan came from a poor background to Boston for education and made a career there. After growing up in poverty in rural North Carolina, Cowan went to Duke University and then Northeastern University School of Law. He never left, and became a prominent Boston lawyer.\n Cowan's appointment means that there will be two black senators serving together for the first time in American history. Neither was elected -- Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) was appointed in December after former Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) left the chamber in the middle of his term.\n Cowan's selection is a step forward for a state that has a troubled history with race relations, exploding in the South Boston busing riots in the 1970s. Patrick, the state's first African-American governor, said recently on local cable television that it was a priority for him to pick a woman or a person of color for the seat. Cowan will become the second black senator from Massachusetts, after Edward Brooke, who served from 1967 to 1979.\n Patrick on Wednesday was asked to reflect on the fact that eight years ago, the highest black official in the state was Suffolk County D.A. Ralph Martin. Patrick said it was important to have black elected officials, adding, \"the commonwealth and the country [are] changing.\"\n Cowan said Patrick offered him the job on Tuesday, and he accepted.\n He said there would be \"no daylight\" between him and Kerry on policy. When asked about the looming sequester, he said the \"best-case scenario\" was a \"balanced approach\" of spending cuts and tax increases. \"I don't think anyone believes it's in the best interest to do straight across-the-board cuts,\" he said.\n Patrick has consistently said that the pick to succeed Kerry should not run in the general election slated for June 25. Cowan embraced the temporary appointment Wednesday, repeating over and over that his stint would be short. Asked about his political future, he said, \"I am not running for office; I am not a candidate in the future.\"\n The late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) requested in a letter written before his death that the interim pick to replace him not run in the general election, a principle that Patrick honored after Kennedy died by picking Kennedy's longtime chief of staff, Paul Kirk.\n Former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) was the only person to publicly campaign for the interim appointment, announcing his desire to fill the seat on MSNBC and doing subsequent interviews about it. Frank promised that he would not run in the June election if appointed, and he endorsed Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) for Senate, though the two fought over the redistricting process that Frank blamed for his exit from the House of Representatives. Progressive groups lined up to rally support for Frank, but Patrick reportedly bristled at his public pursuit of the seat.\n Frank praised Cowan in a brief statement Wednesday. \"I know Mr. Cowan is committed to working hard and in a socially fair and economically efficient manner toward solving pending budget issues,\" he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I now look forward to working for the election of Ed Markey to continue this work, and to providing President Obama the support he deserves in carrying out the mandate he received in November.\" A Frank representative did not respond to interview requests from The Huffington Post.\n The only announced candidate for the general election is Markey, who has received a flood of endorsements from Democrats -- including Kerry -- and has a $3.1 million war chest. Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) is expected to announce his bid Thursday for the seat. Lynch holds more conservative positions than Markey; he opposes abortion rights and voted against President Barack Obama's health care law.\n Former Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) has not said what he will do, but the Associated Press reported Tuesday that he was \"leaning strongly\" towards a run and would likely announce his candidacy early next week. Brown has kept a low public profile since leaving the Senate in January, other than lashing out at his Twitter critics in a string of messages early Saturday morning.\n",

Official Invokes 5th Amendment at Hearing\n\nPUBLISHED: 2013/05/22\n\nWASHINGTON \u00e2\u20ac\u201d The Internal Revenue Service official who first disclosed that the agency had targeted conservative groups for special scrutiny, and in doing so ignited a controversy that has ensnared the White House, denied on Wednesday that she had ever provided false information to Congress. She then invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and declined to testify at a House hearing on the agency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions.\n As the official, Lois Lerner, appeared under subpoena before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, she sternly told her questioners that accusations that she had misled Congress in previous testimony were false.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have not done anything wrong. I have not broken any laws,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Ms. Lerner, who leads the I.R.S.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s division on tax-exempt organizations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have not violated any I.R.S. rules and regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other Congressional committee.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Ms. Lerner has become a person of intense interest to Congressional investigators, who insist that she made, at best, incomplete statements when she said she first learned that her subordinates had singled out Tea Party groups after reading news media reports last year. An inspector general\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report found, however, that she was briefed on their actions as early as June 2011.\n After she refused on Wednesday to say anything more to the committee, despite attempts by Representative Darrell Issa of California, the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Republican chairman, to persuade her otherwise, Mr. Issa tried to dismiss her and her lawyer. But that upset other Republicans, who said that Ms. Lerner should not be let go so quickly.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to tell your side of the story and then not be subjected to cross-examination,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She ought to stand here and answer our questions.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Issa made a second attempt to persuade her to change her mind. But when she declined, he dismissed her again. Ms. Lerner then left the hearing room with her lawyer to a whir of camera shutters.\n That exchange set the tone for a contentious hearing that veered into veiled accusations that the White House had a larger role in the controversy than previously disclosed, as well as outright attacks on President Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s character.\n Mr. Issa said he reserved the right to recall Ms. Lerner later. And he may elect to do so, given the objections of some Republicans on Wednesday after he dismissed her. They argued that by making an opening statement, she had waived her Fifth Amendment right and could be compelled to testify, a contention Ms. Lerner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyer disputed.\n The committee also heard testimony from Douglas H. Shulman, the former I.R.S. commissioner; Neal S. Wolin, the deputy secretary of the Treasury Department; and J. Russell George, the Treasury inspector general who looked into the accusations of targeting. And as the hearing continued, Republicans and Democrats pressed ahead with one point on which they agree these days: that an inept I.R.S. had committed serious misdeeds.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The power to tax is the power to destroy,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Issa said.\n Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the committee, also scolded the agency. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I believe there was gross incompetence and mismanagement,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are better than that. We are simply better than that.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But Mr. Cummings also admonished his Republican colleagues. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think we need to be very, very careful not to let partisanship undermine the integrity not only of the committee but our investigation and our work product,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n The hearing, the second this week on the I.R.S.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to target conservative groups, offered few new revelations. Mr. George did shed some light on the extent of the accusations against the I.R.S., saying that at this point in this investigation he had no reason to believe any illegal conduct occurred. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We do not deem it illegal. We do not believe that it was illegal, what they did,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n At times, committee members could hardly conceal their contempt for the I.R.S. and the Obama White House.\n Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, tried to link the I.R.S. scandal with other controversies that are dogging the Obama administration.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This administration, which told us and told the American people that the attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi was the work, was caused by a video, is now the same administration who expects us to believe that this scandal was just the result of two rogue agents in Cincinnati,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buy it.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Representative James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, said the way that applicants for tax-exempt status were buried in I.R.S. paperwork reminded him of another sore point that Republicans have with the Obama administration.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Man, that sounds like the Keystone Pipeline to me,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said, referring to the proposed cross-country oil pipeline that the president has so far declined to approve.\n One Democrat, Representative Stephen F. Lynch of Massachusetts, even raised the threat of appointing a special prosecutor if Congress continues to feel that the I.R.S. is not being straightforward.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know where that will lead. It will lead to a special prosecutor,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There will be hell to pay if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the route we choose to go down.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Later, Mr. Jordan pressed Mr. Shulman, the former I.R.S. commissioner, on whether he had visited the White House. When Mr. Shulman said he had, Mr. Jordan produced White House visitor records that he said indicated Mr. Shulman had been there at least 118 times. Was he sure, Mr. Jordan asked, that the I.R.S. targeting never came up?\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One hundred-eighteen visits and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come up in casual conversation?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Jordan said.\n In follow-up questioning by Representative Gerald E. Connolly, a Virginia Democrat, Mr. Shulman offered what he said was one of the many plausible explanations why he would have visited the White House. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Easter Egg Roll with my kids,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n",

Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) pleaded guilty in a federal courtroom Wednesday morning to using campaign funds to purchase an array of personal items including Bruce Lee memorabilia, a $43,000 Rolex watch and a mink cashmere cape.\n He pleaded guilty to conspiracy before U.S. District Judge Robert L. Wilkins. His wife, Sandra Jackson, who resigned from her position on Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s city council, is expected to plead guilty to filing false tax returns before the same judge on Wednesday afternoon.\n Jackson, dressed in a blue tie, blue shirt and a blue suit, looked back in the direction of his father and wife several times during the hearing. At one point he appeared to mouth, \"I'm sorry.\" The former representative, who co-wrote a 1999 book with his father, Rev. Jesse Jackson, titled It's About the Money!: How You Can Get Out of Debt, Build Wealth, and Achieve Your Financial Dreams, was accused of spending $750,000 in campaign funds on personal items for himself and for his wife.\n Jackson said he was clearheaded and had not been under treatment for alcohol or drug abuse, though he did have a beer last night. He said he had never been more clear in his life, and had read the documents thoroughly and had understood the consequences of his actions.\n He acknowledged he \"used money that shouldn't have been used,\" calling the government's statement accurate and saying he had \"no interest in wasting the taxpayers' time or money.\"\n The judge set the sentencing for June 28 at 2 p.m. Jackson will be free to go after he surrenders his passport, and will be restricted to living in the D.C. or Chicago area.\n The former national co-chairman of President Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2008 presidential campaign, Jackson was first elected to office in 1995 and resigned from Congress last year amid a federal investigation and his treatment for bipolar disorder.\n In a statement issued by his lawyers on Friday after court records indicated he planned a guilty plea, Jackson said he had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no excuses\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d for his conduct and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fully accept my responsibility for the improper decisions and mistakes I have made.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n UPDATE 2:52 p.m. -- Additional records disclosed Wednesday revealed that expenses charged by Jackson and his wife to his campaign included $4,272.78 on the Navigator of the Seas cruise, $2,306.08 at Walt Disney World, over $10,000 at Best Buy, over $300 at Build-A-Bear, $3,544.00 at Mariel's Boutique, and $5,687.75 on Martha's Vineyard Holistic Retreat.

It was the first time the agency acknowledged the practice.\n \"They used names like Tea Party or patriots ... and they selected cases simply because the application had those names in the title,\" she admitted.\n She said she hadn't revealed the information sooner, because she was never asked. But just two days before the ABA conference, Lerner was specifically asked about the investigation.\n Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., asked her if she could \"comment briefly on the status on the IRS investigation into these political not-for-profits.\"\n She said: \"Well there's a questionnaire that began this discussion and there's also a questionnaire out there that is seeking info from 501 c3,4,5 organizations.\"\n Crowley later called her answer evasive.\n \"The bottom line is you cannot lie to Congress, and you cannot be evasive, you cannot try to mislead Congress,\" he said.\n In the 1990's, Lerner also served as chief of enforcement at the Federal Elections Commission.\n Under her direction, the FEC undertook the largest enforcement action in its history -- suing the Christian Coalition for violating campaign laws. The Christian Coalition won, but in one deposition, FEC lawyers asked a defendant if televangelist Pat Robertson prayed for him.\n James Bopp, the Christian Coalition's lawyer, said he was \"shocked and appalled\" by that.\n \"Both political activity and religious activity are specifically protected by the First Amendment,\" he said.\n When Bopp learned years later that Lerner had been promoted to an IRS position, he became concerned.\n \"She was in effect being promoted for what she had done at the Federal Election Commission and now was going to be expected ... to replicate that at the IRS and now we know that's exactly what happened,\" he said.\n Lerner is represented by lawyer William W. Taylor, who is noted for winning a dismissal of all charges against former IMF director Dominique Strauss-Kahn in a high-profile sexual assault case.\n Lerner said at Wednesday's hearing that she had done nothing wrong.\n \"I have not done anything wrong,\" she said. \"I have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee.\"\n",

NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre in December called for armed officers to be installed in every school in the country.\n Former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, who led the NRA's review, appeared to ease off slightly on the call for armed officers in every school -- he said it's \"important\" for every school to have at least one, but acknowledged these decisions are \"locally made\" based on unique budget circumstances.\n Hutchinson, though, did call for the creation of a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers. To accompany that, his group proposed a \"model\" state law that would allow certain personnel who have undergone this training to carry weapons on school grounds.\n \"This is not talking about all teachers,\" he said. \"Teachers should teach.\"\n The 225-page report also called for states to require schools to conduct a safety assessment and for a pilot program to be created assessing mental health as a pre-indicator for violence.\n Mark Mattioli, the father of one Newtown shooting victim, also spoke after Hutchinson's announcement to applaud the review effort.\n The review comes as Congress and a number of state legislatures pursue gun control legislation. While a few have focused on school security -- South Dakota has already approved legislation allowing for teachers to be armed -- many have concentrated on enacting or expanding assault weapons bans, strengthening background checks and passing other measures to restrict access to firearms. Connecticut, the home of the Sandy Hook school shooting, is the latest to advance a sweeping gun control proposal -- lawmakers announced a deal Monday on a package that is likely to win approval.\n But LaPierre in December argued that improving school security is paramount. He argued that if banks and members of Congress can have protection, schools across America should be afforded the same security.\n \"It's now time for us to assume responsibly for our schools,\" he said. \"The only way to stop a monster from killing our kids is to be permanently involved and invested in a plan of absolute protection.\"\n He added: \"The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\"\n",

John Kerry, D-Mass., who was tapped to replace Clinton at the department.\n One issue that may come up is the department's funding. Assertions that State Department posts are left vulnerable because Congress has decided not to fully fund security requests pervaded Wednesday's hearings.\n \"Shame on the House for ... failing to adequately fund the administration's request,\" Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., said\n Clinton, in turn, affirmed their claims, saying budget issues are a \"bipartisan problem.\"\n Budget numbers, though, actually show the overall diplomatic security budget has ballooned over the past decade.\n Democrats point to modest decreases in funding in recent years, and the fact that Congress has approved less than was requested. But Congress often scales back the administration's requests, and not just for the State Department.\n And the complaints tend to overlook the fact that the overall security budget has more than doubled since fiscal 2004.\n For that year, the budget was $640 million. It steadily climbed to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2010. It dipped to $1.5 billion the following year and roughly $1.35 billion in fiscal 2012 -- still far more than it was a decade ago.\n Slightly more has been requested for fiscal 2013.\n It's difficult to tell how much was specifically allocated for Benghazi. Tripoli was the only post mentioned in the department's fiscal 2013 request -- funding for that location did slip, from $11.5 million in fiscal 2011 to $10.1 million the following year.\n Slightly more has been requested for fiscal 2013.\n Still, then-Deputy Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security Charlene Lamb testified in October that the size of the attack -- and not the money -- was the issue.\n Asked if there was any budget consideration that led her not to increase the security force, she said: \"No.\"\n She added: \"This was an unprecedented attack in size.\" Asked again about budget issues, Lamb said: \"Sir, if it's a volatile situation, we will move assets to cover that.\"\n Asked Wednesday about Lamb's testimony, Clinton noted that the review board that examined the Libya attack found budget issues have played a role.\n \"That's why you have an independent group like an (Accountability Review Board); that's why it was created to look at everything,\" Clinton said.\n But Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., said \"any suggestion that this is a budget issue is off base, or political.\"\n Other lawmakers further complained that the State Department has spent millions on lower-priority projects that could have been spent on security.\n Another pivotal issue Wednesday dealt with an Aug. 16 cable. That cable summarized an emergency meeting the day before by the U.S. Mission in Benghazi and warned the consulate could not defend against a \"coordinated attack.\"\n That cable is seen as one of the vital warnings sent out of Libya in the months leading up to the attack. But, to the dismay of lawmakers, Clinton repeatedly said she never saw it.\n \"That cable did not come to my attention. I have made it very clear that the security cables did not come to my attention or above the assistant secretary level,\" Clinton said. \"I'm not aware of anyone within my office, within the secretary's office, having seen the cable.\"\n Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said \"somebody within your office should have seen this cable.\"\n \"An emergency meeting was held and a cable sent out on Aug. 16 by the ambassador himself, warning of what could happen. And this meant this cable went unnoticed by your office. That's the bottom line,\" he said.\n Clinton said it was \"very disappointing\" that \"inadequacies\" were found in the \"responsiveness of our team here in Washington,\" and said \"it's something we're fixing and intend to put into place protocols and systems to make sure it doesn't happen again.\"\n The secretary tried to explain that \"1.43 million cables\" come through the department every year. They are addressed to her but in many cases do not go to her. Rather, they go through \"the bureaucracy.\"\n Republicans argue the Aug. 16 cable was rather high priority. As Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., put it, \"Libya has to have been one of the hottest of hot spots around the world.\" He claimed that not knowing about their security requests \"really, I think, cost these people their lives.\"\n \"Had I been president at the time, and I found that you did not read the cables from Benghazi, you did not read the cables from Ambassador Stevens, I would have relieved you of your post. I think it's inexcusable,\" Paul said.\n",

The letter from Taylor states that her testimony would \"have no purpose other than to embarrass or burden her.\"\n The Wednesday hearing would have been Lerner's first public appearance, and first under oath, since she apologized for the IRS' inappropriate targeting of conservative groups at a May 10 American Bar Association meeting. That apology was planned ahead of time by the IRS, and came in response to a planted question.\n Issa has issued a subpoena to compel Lerner to appear at the hearing.\n Lerner is a key figure in the unfolding IRS scandal. As director of the IRS exempt organizations unit, she is in charge of the division overseeing nonprofit organizations, which includes the Cincinnati office that was the source of the inappropriate targeting criteria. The criteria directed the IRS to conduct a more intensive review of applications for tax-exempt status from groups with the name \"tea party\" or \"patriot.\"\n According to the report issued by the Department of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, Lerner had to correct the criteria developed by the Cincinnati office twice because she and other top IRS officials found that they were using politically fraught terms as they sought to make sure groups were properly applying for tax exemption.\n Lerner's decision to plead the Fifth comes as the Department of Justice has initiated an investigation into whether laws were broken at the IRS, according to Taylor's letter to the committee. It also follows a request to Lerner from the committee to provide information on why she gave \"false or misleading information\" to the committee on four previous occasions in 2012.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Committee has been contacted by Ms. Lerner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyer who stated that his client intended to invoke her 5th amendment right and refuse to answer questions,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Oversight and Government Reform Committee spokesman Ali Ahmad said in a statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ms. Lerner remains under subpoena from Chairman Issa to appear at tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hearing \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the Committee has a Constitutional obligation to conduct oversight. Chairman Issa remains hopeful that she will ultimately decide to testify tomorrow about her knowledge of outrageous IRS targeting of Americans for their political beliefs.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Details Plan for Armed School Guards\n\nPUBLISHED: 2013/04/02\n\nReport Sees Guns as Path to Safety in Schools\n WASHINGTON \u00e2\u20ac\u201d With the Senate set to debate gun control this month, a National Rifle Association task force released a 225-page report on Tuesday that called for armed police officers, security guards or staff members in every American school, and urged states to loosen gun restrictions to allow trained teachers and administrators to carry weapons.\n Asa Hutchinson, a former Republican congressman from Arkansas who led the task force, unveiled the report at a packed news conference with unusually heavy security, including a bomb-sniffing yellow Labrador retriever. A dozen officers in plain clothes and uniforms stood watch as he spoke; one warned photographers to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remain stationary\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d during the event.\n Among the study\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central conclusions is that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the presence of armed security personnel adds a layer of security and diminishes response time\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d in a shooting, Mr. Hutchinson said. He cited a 1997 Mississippi case in which an assistant principal ran to his truck to retrieve a .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol and subdued a gunman who had killed two students.\n The recommendations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which also included expanding the police presence in schools \u00e2\u20ac\u201d drew immediate criticism from gun control advocates and many Democrats, who have been fighting to tighten gun restrictions after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in December.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Arming the teacher is merely a response to the last tragedy,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Representative Mike Thompson, a California Democrat who is chairman of a House task force on gun violence. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The one before that was in a shopping mall in Oregon, and the one before that was in a movie theater in Colorado. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the proper response is to arm all the projectionists in the movie theaters or all the vendors in the mall.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n After the Newtown shooting, Wayne LaPierre, the rifle association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive director, announced that it would devise a plan to put armed guards in every school. Technically, Mr. Hutchison\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s task force is independent of the rifle association, even though it paid for the study, and Mr. LaPierre was not present on Tuesday. But critics see no distinction between the two.\n Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Defense Fund, an advocacy group here, criticized the study as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nothing more than a continuation of the N.R.A.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to prey on America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fears, saturate our schools with more guns and turn them into armed fortresses.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But the report did get support from at least one Newtown parent: Mark Mattioli, whose 6-year-old son, James, was killed.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think politics needs to be set aside here, and I hope this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lead to name-calling,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Mr. Mattioli, who joined Mr. Hutchinson at the news conference. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a recommendation for solutions, real solutions that will make our kids safer. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we need.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n At least one state, Indiana, is considering the idea of armed officers at schools. On Tuesday, a proposal that would require public and charter schools to have an armed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153protection officer\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d on school property during class hours passed a State House committee.\n The task force panel called on the Departments of Homeland Security, Education and Justice to coordinate school safety efforts and provide grant money for schools to assess their ability to prevent and respond to attacks. It recommended that officers or employees who are armed take a 40- to 60-hour training course to be developed by the rifle association based on a model the task force has designed.\n The group also called on states to require schools to develop security plans.\n But how and whether the task force recommendations will be put into effect \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and the cost \u00e2\u20ac\u201d was unclear.\n The timing of Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement was not a coincidence: Congress will wrap up its spring recess after this week and is expected to consider gun legislation after lawmakers return. President Obama has called for tough new controls on gun ownership, but the prospects for such legislation are murky \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a testimony to the rifle association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prowess as a lobbying force.\n A plan to revive and revamp a ban on assault weapons, which expired in 2004, is almost certain to be defeated. Mr. Obama is pushing for a measure that would impose mandatory background checks for gun buyers, and the Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, the majority leader, has promised to present a bill that would expand background checks to the floor for a vote.\n",

Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.) on Tuesday released a 225-page report on school safety funded by the National Rifle Association. The report, commissioned in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, recommended properly trained armed employees to provide \"an important layer of security in schools.\"\n The report was prepared by a 12-person task force, called the School Shield Program, led by Hutchinson. At Tuesday's press conference, he stated that its findings were independent of the nation's largest gun lobby.\n \"Teachers should teach, but if there is personnel that has interest and is willing to go through 40 to 60 hours of [firearms] training, then schools should be willing to [arm them],\" Hutchinson said. He added that the report found that \"local school authorities are in the best position\" to determine their own school security measures, \"specifically whether an armed security guard is necessary and supported by the education and citizen community.\"\n The task force recommended that schools designate willing staff to be armed and trained, and it proposed a model training program, 40-60 hours per person, at what Hutchinson said would be a cost of about $800 to $1,000 per trained employee. Armed school personnel, called school resource officers, would also be required to undergo a \"background investigation, testing, and [have] relevant experience.\"\n The committee didn't recommend any specific kind of firearm for school security, Hutchinson said, adding, \"Everything from a sidearm, to a shotgun, to an AR-15\" would work.\n The task force also suggested that states loosen current legal restrictions on who can carry a firearm on school property. Many states currently prohibit anyone but a law enforcement officer from possessing guns in a school.\n Other recommendations included creating threat assessment teams at schools, better coordinating state and federal funding for school security, and offering an online assessment tool, so that administrators can evaluate their schools' potential security gaps.\n Hutchinson's report and his press conference were both met with scathing criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, which supports broader gun control measures and strongly opposes arming educators. In a statement, union President Randi Weingarten called the report \"a cruel hoax that will fail to keep our children and schools safe,\" adding that the findings \"are simply designed to assist gun manufacturers flood the nation and our schools with more guns.\"\n The NRA also put out a statement on the report, over which the gun lobby insists it had no influence. The NRA said it needs \"time to digest\" the findings, but it commended Hutchinson and his team for contributions that \"will go a long way to making America's schools safer.\"\n The report marks the culmination of a controversial process that began in December, when NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre held a press conference the week after the shooting in Newtown, Conn. At the time, LaPierre assailed the media and gun control advocates for their responses to the massacre, and he proposed that armed volunteers protect schools and that gun-free school zones be eliminated. The speech was widely considered a public relations disaster.\n Hutchinson said Tuesday that the idea of armed volunteers was scrapped after it was met with \"great reluctance\" from school employees. But the recommendation that states allow non-law enforcement officers, such as teachers and principals, to carry guns in schools would essentially eliminate gun-free school zones.\n Asked about the current debate in Congress over gun control legislation, Hutchinson said he had \"not dealt with the separate debate\" because he had been too busy considering school safety issues.\n He did, however, weigh in on state gun control efforts currently being debated in Connecticut, which include a ban on high-capacity magazines and a broader assault weapons ban. Hutchinson called them \"totally inadequate.\"\n \"You can address assault weapons, but it doesn't stop violence in schools. So if you're going to protect children, you have to do something about enhancing school safety,\" he said.\n Hutchinson also encouraged the NRA to continue funding pilot programs to train school employees to carry weapons.\n When he had finished introducing the report, Hutchinson called up Mark Mattioli, whose 6-year-old son, James Mattioli, was killed in December along with 19 other children at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Mattioli praised the NRA \"for coming up and spending the time and resources on putting a program like this together.\"\n",

Once DOMA was overturned in June, the question became: What about same-sex married couples who moved to a state that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recognize their marriage (a couple married in Massachusetts who moved to Arkansas, for example)?\n Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew provides a uniform policy for the IRS; the state of celebration -- where the wedding took place -- now trumps the state of residency when it comes to federal tax status for same-sex married couples.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling provides certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide. It provides access to benefits, responsibilities and protections under federal tax law that all Americans deserve,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Lew said in a statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This ruling also assures legally married same-sex couples that they can move freely throughout the country knowing that their federal filing status will not change.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The new policy, which was first shared by Lew in a conference call that included LGBT advocates, holds a bit of political significance. It was the burden of federal tax law on same-sex couples, after all, that prompted the legal challenge to DOMA in the first place.\n Edie Windsor, the plaintiff in the DOMA case, sued the government after being forced to pay estate taxes following the death of her wife, Thea Spyer. Had they been a heterosexual couple, Windsor's tax burden would have been zero. After DOMA was overturned, it was reported that the IRS owed Windsor $363,053.\n Under the new Treasury policy, all federal tax provisions where marriage is a factor, including filing status, employee benefits, IRA contributions, earned income, child tax credits, and income, gift and estate taxes, will apply to same sex couples regardless of where they live. On the flip side, gay couples also will now be subjected to the so-called marriage penalty, in which some (usually upper-middle class) joint filers incur a higher tax burden than they would if they filed as single people.\n The policy only applies to married couples, and not those in domestic partnerships or same-sex unions.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling, committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under our nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s federal tax laws, regardless of what state they call home,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These families finally have access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The Treasury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions on Thursday are just the latest in a set of LGBT policies offered by agencies within the Obama administration following the DOMA ruling. The Federal Election Commission, and Departments of Health and Human Services and Homeland Security, also extended federal benefits to gay couples in states that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recognize their marriages.\n UPDATE: Commenting on the Treasury Department's new policy, Edie Windsor hailed the decision as the precise remedy that she sought when she challenged the constitutionality of DOMA.\n",

They are not secret, in that every member of Congress has been briefed,\" he said during a speech in San Jose, Calif. \"These are programs that have been authored by large bipartisan majorities repeatedly since 2006.\"\n \"Your duly elected representatives have consistently been informed,\" he said.\n News outlets revealed this week that vast spying programs began under President George W. Bush and have continued under Obama. The Guardian reported Wednesday that the National Security Agency had obtained a court order to collect phone records from Verizon Wireless customers, while The Washington Post reported Thursday of the existence of a program launched in 2007 called PRISM, which tracks information from nine leading U.S. Internet companies: Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, AOL, YouTube, Apple, PalTalk and Skype.\n In response to a question after his speech, Obama defended the programs as essential to combating terrorist threats. \"They may identify potential leads with respect to folks who might engage in terrorism,\" he said.\n He also argued that some have overstated the impact of the programs. \"Some of the hype we've been hearing over the past day or so -- nobody has listened to the content of people's phone calls,\" he said.\n \"I welcome this debate and I think it's healthy for our democracy,\" he continued. \"I think it's a sign of maturity, because probably five years ago, six years ago, we might not have been having this debate.\"\n Obama portrayed the programs as a trade-off between security and civil liberties. \"I think it's important to recognize that you can't have 100 percent security, and also then have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience. We're going to have to make some choices as a society,\" he said.\n He also expressed his displeasure that the domestic spying programs' existence was leaked to the press. \"I don't welcome leaks,\" he said. \"There's a reason these programs are classified.\"\n The president's full-throated defense of the programs, albeit with the qualification that he welcomes debate, is unlikely to quell the outrage over the revelations. Obama ran as an antidote to Bush's policies in 2008, but the reports reveal that he has continued many of them, leading to concerns over the reach of the national security state.\n Obama went on to defend those who operated the programs as \"professionals.\" \"In the abstract, you can complain about 'Big Brother' and how this is a potential program run amok. But when you actually look at the details, then I think we've struck the right balance,\" he said.\n",

Jan Brewer (R) announced her decision to veto legislation on Wednesday that would have allowed businesses to legally refuse service to anyone on \"religious freedom\" grounds, effectively allowing them to discriminate against same-sex couples.\n Brewer said the bill had \"the potential to create more problems than it purports to solve.\"\n \"Senate Bill 1062 does not address a specific or present concern related to religious liberty in Arizona,\" she said. \"I have not heard one example where business owners' religious liberty has been violated.\"\n The state legislature passed the bill, known as SB 1062, last week. But in recent days, it has come under intense criticism from activists, lawmakers and business interests both in Arizona and nationally. The state's two Republican senators, Jeff Flake and John McCain, called on Brewer to veto it, and major corporations like Marriott, Apple and American Airlines all wrote to the governor and expressed their opposition.\n Businesses in the Phoenix area were also especially worried, with the Super Bowl set to be held in Glendale, Ariz. in 2015. On Monday, the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee came out against SB 1062, stating, \"[W]e have heard loud and clear from our various stakeholders that adoption of this legislation would not only run contrary to that goal but deal a significant blow to the state's economic growth potential. We do not support this legislation.\"\n Arizona hasn't been the only state pushing a bill that would allow open discrimination against same-sex couples; similar bills have been popping up in states including Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota and Maine.\n CORRECTION: This article originally said the Super Bowl is set to be held in Tempe, Ariz.

The issues raised by Michael Brown's death, Holder said, have simmered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beneath the surface in more communities than just Ferguson.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n On Thursday, he told reporters in Washington that the Justice Department would thoroughly investigate the case, and would \"continue to stand with Ferguson.\" He also said that \"few things have affected me as greatly as my trip to Ferguson.\"\n Before a larger meeting at St. Louis Community College\u00e2\u20ac\u201cFlorissant Valley on Wednesday, the attorney general met with several students at the local school in what he described as an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153opportunity to sit down with some wonderful young people and to hear them talk about the mistrust they have at a young age.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Dominique McCoy, who attended the smaller meeting, told The Huffington Post that Holder said change wouldn't happen overnight. \"He just let us speak, basically. He semi-voiced his opinion, but we all did the talking. He agreed somewhat to what everyone said,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d McCoy added.\n A separate attendee, Molyrik Welch, noted to another reporter that her brother had died following an encounter with Ferguson police in 2011.\n Holder told the students he understands \"the mistrust\" between some residents and the police.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am the attorney general of the United States, but I am also a black man,\" Holder said.\n Holder told others at the community college how he had been stopped on the New Jersey Turnpike and accused of speeding twice in the past, with police searching his car.\n \"I remember how humiliating that was and how angry I was and the impact it had on me,\" Holder said.\n \"The same kid who got stopped on the New Jersey freeway is now the attorney general of the United States,\" Holder added. \"This country is capable of change. But change doesn't happen by itself.\"\n After the college events, Holder headed over to Drake's Place restaurant in Ferguson to talk with other community members. Some people were told that they would be meeting with an official from the Justice Department, but not that it was Holder. The owners of the restaurant said they were informed of the event only about an hour ahead of time. The Justice Department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Community Relations Service had arranged for the gatherings.\n Holder was greeted as a star at Drake's Place, posing for selfies and group photos with residents and shaking hands. He settled into a corner booth as residents explained the problems that need to be rectified.\n Soon, Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, who has earned some praise since he took over policing of Ferguson's nightly protests, stopped by to greet the attorney general.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My man! You are the man,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Holder said as Johnson walked in.\n After the meeting, attendees said they were thankful that Holder and the federal government were paying attention to Ferguson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He told me that he was here because he was concerned about everything that was going on and he wanted us to voice our opinions and what did we want to change, and that he was going back to the White House to report so we can get some funding, so we can get a game plan on how to help our community,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Angela Whitman told HuffPost.\n Yvette Townsend-Saunders called the meeting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wonderful\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and said she was thankful that Holder had come to the town.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He said that there needs to be some changes made, things need to be looked into and investigated,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Townsend-Saunders said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you were a little boy and you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do something well at school, your mother had to jump in. When the teacher didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do something right, the principal had to jump in. I think if you do something right from the bottom, the top doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to jump in. If things were done right in the beginning, all this wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to be.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know it was Eric Holder [coming],\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Rev. John Paul Hopping of Our Lady of Guadalupe, told HuffPost. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They were really nice and they were really listening. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for solutions and they want to help.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n At the community college, Holder said that they were starting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a good dialogue\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d but that it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not enough.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need concrete action to change things in this country,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said, according to excerpts provided by the Justice Department. \"This dialogue is important. But it can't simply be that we have a conversation that begins based on what happened on August 9 and ends sometime in December, and nothing happens. As I was just telling these young people, change is possible. The same kid who got stopped on the New Jersey freeway is now the attorney general of the United States. This country is capable of change. But change doesn't happen by itself.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In addition to Ferguson community members, Holder spent Wednesday meeting with officials from the St. Louis-based U.S. attorney's office and the local FBI office investigating Brown's death. He is talking with Brown's parents and with members of the local congressional delegation.\n",

He raised just over $200,000 for his campaign, while Cantor spent more than $1 million in April and May alone to try to beat back his challenge.\n However, Brat offset the cash disadvantage with endorsements from conservative activists like radio host Laura Ingraham and with help from local Tea Party activists angry at Cantor.\n Brat cast the congressman as a Washington insider who isn't conservative enough. Last month, a feisty crowd of Brat supporters booed Cantor in front of his family at a local party convention.\n Brat received his doctorate from American University, his master's from Princeton Theological Seminary and his bachelor's from Hope College. In addition to teaching, he has served on the state Joint Advisory Board of Economists and served as the president of the Virginia Association of Economists.\n He also states on his website that he is active in his local Republican party, and has often served as commentator on economic issues for local media.\n Brat is married and has two children, an 11-year-old daughter and a 15-year-old son.\n",

Chris Christie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s re-election campaign and to the state Republican Party as part of a preliminary inquiry into accusations that aides to Mr. Christie shut down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge as political retribution, the lawyer for the campaign and the party said Thursday.\n A person briefed on the matter said the prosecutors had also issued subpoenas to some of the 20 people and entities \u00e2\u20ac\u201d including potential witnesses and people who have come under scrutiny in the inquiry \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that received subpoenas last week from a New Jersey legislative committee whose investigation largely parallels the federal one.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can confirm that the Christie for Governor re-election campaign and the New Jersey Republican State Committee received subpoenas for documents from the U.S. attorney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office, in addition to the subpoena the campaign previously received from the state legislative committee,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the lawyer, Mark D. Sheridan, said in an email.\n Mr. Sheridan is representing the campaign along with Robert D. Luskin; both men are partners at Patton Boggs.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The campaign and the state party intend to cooperate with the U.S. attorney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office and the state legislative committee and will respond to the subpoenas accordingly,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Sheridan said.\n According to the person briefed on the matter, the subpoenas, issued by prosecutors in the office of the United States attorney for New Jersey, Paul J. Fishman, seek a broad range of records relating to the lane closings: emails, text messages, other correspondence and memorandums, calendar entries, spreadsheets, voice mail messages.\n They also specifically seek records relating to three close aides to Mr. Christie who resigned or were fired when their roles in the lane closings were revealed. They were the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, and Bill Baroni and David Wildstein, two senior officials and allies of Mr. Christie at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the bridge.\n Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and prosecutors from Mr. Fishman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office have also undertaken what appears to be an unrelated inquiry. On Saturday, the mayor of Hoboken, Dawn Zimmer, said Mr. Christie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lieutenant governor and another senior administration official had threatened in May to withhold federal recovery aid for Hurricane Sandy unless she supported a development favored by the Christie administration. On Sunday, Ms. Zimmer issued a statement saying prosecutors in Mr. Fishman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office had interviewed her about her accusation.\n The lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, emphatically denied the allegations on Monday. Ms. Zimmer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s account, however, was supported in some measure by two of the mayor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aides, who were interviewed by F.B.I. agents and told them that Ms. Zimmer had recounted the threat to them around the time she said it occurred, two people briefed on the matter have said. A Hoboken city councilman, David Mello, also said that Ms. Zimmer told him several months later about the encounter with Ms. Guadagno.\n The bridge inquiry being conducted by Mr. Fishman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office was confirmed this month. The office said at the time that it would seek to determine whether any federal laws had been broken. The subpoenas issued this week show that prosecutors have begun taking the necessary steps to answer that question.\n A spokeswoman for Mr. Fishman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office, Rebekah Carmichael, said Thursday afternoon that she could neither confirm nor deny whether any specific investigative steps had been taken. She has declined to comment on Ms. Zimmer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allegation.\n Despite the inquiries, Mr. Christie seemed to be trying to conduct business as usual. The Republican Governors Association announced on Thursday that he would make fund-raising trips to Illinois, Texas, Massachusetts, Georgia, Connecticut and Utah in the coming months.\n",

McCarthy, 49, began gathering commitments from other House Republicans on Wednesday, the day after then-Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) suffered a stunning loss in the primary for his seat.\n In his current role as whip, McCarthy's job is to round up votes from other Republicans. The election is Thursday -- leaving little time for Labrador to build momentum and peel off votes from McCarthy.\n The former immigration attorney stepped forward to run after a number of other conservative House Republicans declined to.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was stunned when Eric Cantor lost his primary election earlier this week. Eric is a good friend and I have tremendous respect for him. But the message from Tuesday is clear -- Americans are looking for a change in the status quo,\" Labrador said in a statement.\n He also said that he would run for majority leader in hopes of creating \"a leadership team that can bring the Republican conference together.\" It's a reference to the fact that Labrador is generally respected by both the House leadership and back-bench tea party legislators.\n Since the 2010 midterm tea party wave election, the House GOP has contained a bloc of members who have opposed the establishment leadership time and time again. The tea party group has pulled other legislators to the right on a host of issues, including many related to government spending and debt.\n When Cantor lost his seat in a shock result Tuesday, conservatives in the House were not prepared to unite behind a standard-bearer, much less wage an organized effort to whip up votes in support of a candidate for majority leader. Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) was considered a front-runner to challenge McCarthy. But Hensarling pondered his options for a full day Wednesday, while McCarthy moved quickly to generate support.\n On Friday, the Washington Post reported that Hensarling does not plan to run, according to three people familiar with his plans.\n Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) was the other conservative alternate to McCarthy, though he is almost as much an establishment character as anyone else in leadership. He too declined to run, sensing McCarthy's near inevitability. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) also demurred.\n The situation left House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and the rest of the Republican leadership in the House with a problem: The 40 or so hardline tea party members of the House GOP do not want the response to Cantor's loss -- which was driven by grassroots discontent with the establishment -- to simply be more establishment leadership. This discontent may be satisfied if Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) wins his race against Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) for House majority whip, taking McCarthy's spot.\n Members of the tea party caucus also want to vote for a majority leader candidate that they believe in, even if he loses. House GOP leadership understands that desire, as does Labrador. A Labrador bid helps all parties regardless of the outcome -- including Labrador himself, since a run will elevate him as a leader inside the House GOP.\n There is always a chance that grassroots fervor in support of Labrador could gain a level of intensity that Boehner and McCarthy did not anticipate. However, there's not a lot of time for that to happen before next Thursday's election, and leadership elections generally are dominated by inside baseball politics and arcane political interests. In addition, a few of the most hardline House Republicans, such as Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) and Rep. Michelle Bachmann (R-Minn.) said Thursday that Labrador was not conservative enough on immigration reform.\n Labrador is an ambitious, sometimes savvy politician. He is in Idaho this weekend chairing the state GOP convention. He also appeared Friday at an event with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who offered his support for Labrador's candidacy.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There really is a question what is the message that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sent when the voters replace someone in leadership. They want someone different. I think Raul brings that,\" Paul told reporters, according to the Spokesman-Review.\n",

But as the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Grassley could assume the chairmanship if his party takes control of the Senate this year. Mr. Braley, speaking at a January fund-raiser in Corpus Christi, Tex., was explaining why he should go to the Senate instead of his Republican opponent.\n America Rising, a conservative political action committee that has vowed to use videos and opposition research to attack Democratic candidates, posted the footage on YouTube on Tuesday.

Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.), wrote that the two teenagers should \"try showing a little class,\" \"dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar,\" and, most of all, \"don't make faces\" at Very Serious public events.\n Read the full rant via Gawker:\n Dear Sasha and Malia, I get you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re both in those awful teen years, but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a part of the First Family, try showing a little class. At least respect the part you play. Then again your mother and father don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t respect their positions very much, or the nation for that matter, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m guessing you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re coming up a little short in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood role model\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 department. Nevertheless, stretch yourself. Rise to the occasion. Act like being in the White House matters to you. Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar. And certainly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make faces during televised public events.\n The First Daughters join President Obama at the ceremony every year, where they can hardly contain their disdain for the lame dad jokes that predictably follow. Before approaching Mac and Cheese, the two turkeys, the president remarked that it was \"puzzling that I do this every year.\" Malia even declined her father's offer to pet one of the pardoned turkeys with a nonchalant, \"Nah.\"\n Lauten later apologized for rushing to judgment on Facebook.\n \"I reacted to an article and quickly judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager,\" she said. \"After many hours of prayer, talking to my parents and re-reading my words online, I can see more clearly how hurtful my words were. Please know that these judgmental feelings truly have no place in my heart. Furthermore, I'd like to apologize to all of those who I have hurt and offended with my words, and pledge to learn and grow (and I assure you I have) from this experience.\"\n",

Although he's expressed openness to legal status previously, his comments could be a hint at what's to come in the House GOP's plan to soon release its own principles for immigration reform.\n \"The principles aren't combined, written out yet, but in my personal belief I think it'll go with legal status that will allow you to work and pay your taxes,\" McCarthy told KBFX Eyewitnesses News. \"But if you want to become a citizen, you'll have to go through the path. There won't be amnesty inside it.\"\n He added later, \"That's a decision that every Republican will have to make in laying out the principles, but that's my personal position.\"\n McCarthy has previously been more open to immigration reform than many of his House Republican colleagues, and, as TPM notes, his district is 35 percent Latino.

Aide Quits After Ridiculing Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daughters, Sasha and Malia\n\nPUBLISHED: 2014/12/01\n\nWASHINGTON \u00e2\u20ac\u201d A young Republican congressional aide resigned Monday after her Facebook post berating President Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daughters for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon became a sensation on the Internet.\n On Friday, the aide, Elizabeth Lauten, 31, who has more than 14,000 followers on Twitter as @DCGopGirl and at the time was a spokeswoman for a little-known congressman from Tennessee, wrote an open letter to Sasha and Malia Obama on her Facebook page, saying they should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153try showing a little class\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n By Monday, Ms. Lauten had resigned as communications director to Representative Stephen Fincher, a farmer and gospel singer perhaps best known for his whimsically named hometown, Frog Jump. Ms. Lauten, now a footnote in Mr. Fincher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s career, is the latest cautionary tale about the dangers of social media sniping directed at the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most famous offspring.\n It started Wednesday with the most innocuous of events: the annual naming of the National Thanksgiving Turkey, when Mr. Obama officially liberated Cheese, a large white bird with impressive plumage, from the Thursday dinner table.\n Per tradition, the first daughters were in attendance, this time wearing mostly cheerless expressions and short outfits. Malia, 16, was dressed in a plaid miniskirt, sweater, dark tights and black hiking-style boots. Sasha, 13, wore a maroon dress, a cardigan sweater, a pair of white midcalf-high socks and black ankle boots.\n At times, the girls gazed glumly at the floor and threw an occasional eye roll at their father as he compared pardoning Cheese to granting amnesty to unauthorized immigrants. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You want to pet him?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Obama asked his daughters.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nah,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Malia said quickly.\n Their teenage disdain drew its fair share of media attention, including a BuzzFeed article titled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Obama Girls Could Not Be More Bored by Their Dad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jokes.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Enter Ms. Lauten \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a former Republican National Committee new media aide who describes herself on Twitter as loving God, cats, the Daughters of the American Revolution \u00e2\u20ac\u0153& all things pink, green and pearls!\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d \u00e2\u20ac\u201d whose commentary had a sharper edge.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I get you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re both in those awful teen years, but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a part of the First Family, try showing a little class,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she wrote above a picture of the unenthused Obama daughters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At least respect the part you play.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n She went on to say that Malia and Sasha were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coming up a little short in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgood role model\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 department\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d because their parents \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t respect their positions very much, or the nation for that matter.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Ms. Lauten wrote what she thought the daughters should have done: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rise to the occasion. Act like being in the White House matters to you. Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Her views were widely circulated and eventually posted on Twitter by a reporter for The Root, a news, opinion and culture site aimed at African-American audiences. A flood of angry responses quickly followed.\n Ms. Lauten, who did not respond to repeated requests for further comment, later posted an apology for her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hurtful\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d words, saying she had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Monday that he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taken aback that there was some political operative on Capitol Hill who did use the occasion of a Thanksgiving-themed event to criticize members of the first family.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Patti Davis, the daughter of Ronald Reagan, could relate. In a letter to Sasha and Malia posted on her website, Ms. Davis recalled being criticized by a reporter decades ago for the outfit she wore to a cocktail reception her parents held for Queen Elizabeth II when Mr. Reagan was president.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As First Daughters, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t win,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ms. Davis wrote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And while there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything normal about the life you are living right now, you still can be.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

There won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be amnesty inside it.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n McCarthy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s district is roughly 35 percent Latino.\n The House Republican immigration principles reportedly will cover how the U.S. border should be protected, how immigration laws should be enforced inside the United States, and how many of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants can embark on a path to legalize their status, according to various media stories.\n The path to legalization\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inclusion in the plan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which House Republican leaders discussed as recently as Wednesday -- is particularly significant given that it is one of the pivotal reasons that plans last year to pass a comprehensive immigration reform law broke down in the House of Representatives after it passed in the Senate in June.\n Conservative members of the Republicans in the House, where they hold a majority, had been adamant about not signing off on any measure that called for granting a pathway to legalization for people who are living in the country illegally. They maintain that that giving those immigrants any kind of break would amount to amnesty, or rewarding law-breakers.\n That created a fight among Republicans in Congress, with some \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including conservatives such as Sen. Marco Rubio, a Tea Party lawmaker from Florida \u00e2\u20ac\u201c arguing that deporting all 11 million undocumented immigrants was not a realistic option, and that not doing anything to bring them onto the radar amounted to an amnesty.\n Proponents of a pathway to legal status argued that the opportunity would be given only to those undocumented immigrants who earned it by meeting a strict set of criteria including paying fines, learning English, having a clean police record and paying taxes.\n Politico, a news site that covers politics, reported that House Speaker John Boehner, who is from Ohio, wants the plan, also referred to as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153principles,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d completed and made public before President Barack Obama delivers his State of the Union address on Jan. 28.\n The plan commits itself to the idea \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is heavily favored by many Republicans \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that immigration reform will be handled in a piecemeal fashion, instead of comprehensively, as the Senate did.\n Obama told Senate Democrats this week that he believes that Boehner will make sure immigration reform is passed this year, according to The Hill, a a political publication in Washington, D.C.\n The president reportedly told the Democrats in a meeting that Republicans need to take action on immigration in order to keep the volatile issue from hurting their chances with Latino voters, as it appears to have done in 2012, when GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney did extremely poorly with the increasingly important voting bloc.\n Obama obtained three quarters of Latino votes cast in 2012, while Romney racked up 27 percent.\n Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, was quoted in The Hill as saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think our Republican colleagues realize that to be blocking immigration reform is not good for them.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Labrador Enters The Race For House Majority Leadership\n\nPUBLISHED: 2014/06/13\n\nIn one of the highest-profile showdowns between establishment Republicans and Tea Party conservatives so far this year, Rep. Raul Labrador said Friday that he is challenging Rep. Kevin McCarthy for the House majority leader position that became open this week.\n Labrador, of Idaho, would be the Tea Party alternative to McCarthy, who is the whip and is favored by establishment Republicans. Only in Congress since 2010, Labrador would represent several firsts: the first Latino, first Mormon and first Idaho lawmaker to be House majority leader.\n Labrador\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foray into the race for majority leader is yet another dramatic turn of events for Republicans, who were stunned by the defeat in Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s primary in Virginia of Rep. Eric Cantor to a Tea Party candidate who cast the congressman as someone who embraces the status quo of Beltway GOP politics and did not truly represent his constituents.\n Americans don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe their leaders in Washington are listening and now is the time to change that.\n And it upends the June 19 voting by the House Republicans for majority leader. On Friday morning, McCarthy, 49, appeared to be headed toward running unopposed after some rivals dropped out.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was stunned when Eric Cantor lost his primary election earlier this week,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Labrador, who is 46, said in his announcement about running for majority leader. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Eric is a good friend and I have tremendous respect for him. But the message from Tuesday is clear \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Americans are looking for a change in the status quo.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Some conservatives in the House were pushing for a postponement of the June 19 election for majority leader, saying they wanted more time to put someone with more right-wing views in the running for the position.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I want a\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6leadership team that can bring the Republican conference together,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Labrador said in his statement, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A leadership team that can help unite and grow our party. Americans don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe their leaders in Washington are listening and now is the time to change that.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Some lawmakers pressed Labrador to run, according to several published reports that quoted unnamed sources.\n Economics professor Dave Brat, the Tea Party candidate who defeated Cantor, attacked the congressman as soft on border security and on people who come here illegally.\n Cantor, who had once been more moderate on immigration issues \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly on the bitterly divisive aspect of whether to give undocumented immigrants already in the U.S. a chance to legalize their status \u00e2\u20ac\u201c shifted sharply to a hard line position, saying he would block any effort in the House to consider proposals to give such immigrants a break.\n But some observers said Cantor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tough stance toward the end of the primary \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d seemed confident he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d easily win \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was too little too late.\n Others say it was Cantor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lack of popularity in general in his district, and his lackluster campaign, that doomed him.\n Nonetheless, many see the next majority leader as potentially influencing the House handling of immigration reform, which stalled as conservative members said they would not support a comprehensive measure for an overhaul of the system, and especially not one that, in their view, would grant amnesty to lawbreakers.\n The Senate last year passed a sweeping bipartisan immigration reform bill that both tightened border security and provided a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants who meet a strict set of criteria.\n McCarthy, whose district is 35 percent Latino, has expressed support for providing a path to legal status, but only after those applying for it earn it by learning English and paying fines and taxes, among other things.\n Labrador, who worked as an immigration attorney before serving in Congress, was part of a bipartisan group in the House that was working on a reform bill. But Labrador famously quit the group because of a disagreement with its other members over whether to entitle undocumented immigrants to some form of healthcare.\n Labrador has not been shy about criticizing House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, saying that he should step down if he allows a vote on an immigration bill this year. The Idaho congressman, echoing other conservatives, has said that Congress should wait until at least 2015 to take up the issue again because President Obama must make a clear attempt to take steps to secure the borders and step up interior enforcement of immigration laws.\n He has said he will not back a version of the Senate reform bill, and prefers to deal with the subject in a piecemeal fashion. Labrador supports a path to legal status, but only after evidence that enforcement has been improved, he has said. He also supports expanding foreign worker visa programs.\n Labrador says this about himself on his website: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Born to a single mother in Puerto Rico, Ra\u00c3\u00bal Labrador moved with his mother to the mainland U.S. at age 13.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153His mother worked many different jobs to make ends meet,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d it says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Though times were tough, Ra\u00c3\u00bal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother often reminded him that if he studied, worked hard, and played by the rules, he could achieve the American Dream. This encouraged Ra\u00c3\u00bal to never give up on his professional aspirations and personal dreams.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n One of the conservative members in the House who wanted to postpone the June 19 vote for majority leader quickly indicated that for him, Labrador would not do.\n Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), tweeted on Friday \"#Labrador is pro amnesty. If not this year, he has strongly advocated for amnesty next year. No fair trying to redefine amnesty.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Primary Upset\n\nPUBLISHED: 2014/06/12\n\nWASHINGTON \u00e2\u20ac\u201d In one of the most stunning primary election upsets in congressional history, the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, was soundly defeated on Tuesday by a Tea Party-backed economics professor who had hammered him for being insufficiently conservative.\n The result delivered a major jolt to the Republican Party \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Mr. Cantor had widely been considered the top candidate to succeed Speaker John A. Boehner \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and it has the potential to change both the debate in Washington on immigration and, possibly, the midterm elections.\n With just over $200,000, David Brat, a professor at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Va., toppled Mr. Cantor, repeatedly criticizing him for being soft on immigration and contending that he supported what critics call amnesty for immigrants in the country illegally.\n During a short concession speech late Tuesday, Mr. Cantor did not try to analyze his defeat or cast blame, saying only that he knew he had disappointed his supporters.\n In victory, Mr. Brat said that his candidacy had resonated with voters who believed that politics had been dumbed down by partisan infighting.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The American people want to pay attention to serious ideas again,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Brat said, speaking on Fox News. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our founding was built by people who were political philosophers, and we need to get back to that, away from this kind of cheap political rhetoric of right and left.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d He will face Jack Trammell, a Democrat who is also a professor at Randolph-Macon, this fall in the heavily Republican district.\n Republicans were so sure that Mr. Cantor would win that most party leaders had been watching for how broad his victory would be. His defeat will reverberate in the capital and could have major implications for any chance of an immigration overhaul.\n Mr. Cantor, 51, who is in his seventh term, had sought to counter Mr. Brat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accusations that he was too willing to compromise on immigration. The majority leader, who had raised $5.4 million for the campaign, blanketed Virginia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Seventh Congressional District with fliers and television advertisements in which he emphasized that he opposed an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153amnesty\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d policy.\n But with significant help from conservative talk radio hosts like Laura Ingraham, Mr. Brat was able to galvanize opposition to Mr. Cantor in one of Virginia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most conservative congressional districts.\n Ms. Ingraham, one of the few high-profile conservatives to put her muscle behind Mr. Brat, said on Fox News on Tuesday night that the primary results were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an absolute repudiation of establishment politics\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and that Republican leaders should take note.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He really just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have very much money, but what he did have was a lot of heart,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she said of Mr. Brat. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think there will be a lot of people out there saying this could be the beginning of something really big for the Republican Party.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Cantor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loss recalled the defeat of former Speaker Thomas S. Foley, a Democrat who lost to a little-known Republican, George Nethercutt, in the 1994 general elections that delivered control of Congress to the Republicans. It is much rarer for a member of the congressional leadership to lose a primary.\n Mr. Brat had little help from national groups that have funded other Tea Party challengers. Instead, he relied mostly on state and local activists.\n Larry Nordvig, executive director of the Richmond Tea Party, said the national groups were not aware of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153how much activity was going on underneath the surface down here and how large the ABC \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Anybody But Cantor \u00e2\u20ac\u201d mentality was.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In a February interview, Mr. Brat spoke of the difficulty he had in rounding up conservative support despite meeting with powerful groups and donors to try to convince them that he was worth the investment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I met with all of them,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tough. Everybody just wants to see the polls, how much money you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve raised. But they do not know what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on on the ground.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Cantor had won primaries in his district, which stretches from Richmond to the Washington suburbs, with as much as 79 percent of the vote, and he won the general election race for a seventh term in 2012 with 58 percent.\n Within the Republican Party, he was seen as a star, with the ability to tap into the energy of the House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more conservative members while at the same time not alienating the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s establishment wing.\n In the House, his relationship with Mr. Boehner reflected some of the larger tensions within the party. Mr. Cantor was strongly opposed, for instance, to the so-called grand bargain negotiations on the budget between the speaker and President Obama.\n Mr. Boehner said Tuesday that he and Mr. Cantor had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153been through a lot together,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d making \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tough choices that come with governing.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Cantor received what amounted to a warning shot from local Republicans at a district convention last month in Henrico County, his political home base, when conservatives ousted one of his loyalists as Republican chairman while he looked on.\n Yet he seemed to recognize the seriousness of the threat only in the final weeks of the campaign, when he suddenly shifted his advertising and began sending aides from Washington to his district. At that point, it was too late to stave off defeat.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are some very angry people upset with the status quo, and Eric became part of that,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said former Representative Thomas M. Davis III, a Virginia Republican. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He was the only conduit they have to express their anger right now. And when Eric Cantor, a conservative and member of the leadership, is too moderate, it sends a chilling effect to other Republicans and makes it that much harder to cross over and work together.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n As for the prospects of an immigration overhaul now, Mr. Davis said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How do you get that or anything done now? Eric is too liberal? This was the guy holding Boehner back.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Many voters also perceived Mr. Cantor as ignoring district concerns as he sought to raise his national profile. He kept a home in suburban Richmond and sent his children to school there, but he spent much of his time in recent years traveling across the country to raise money and campaign for Republican candidates.\n It was all part of his ambition to become speaker of the House, having begun his career as the driver to his predecessor, Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr. Reaching that pinnacle had, of late, seemed as close as ever, with Washington full of speculation that Mr. Boehner would soon retire.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in shock,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Representative Patrick T. McHenry, Republican of North Carolina.\n Congressional Democrats were ecstatic, and so stunned by Mr. Cantor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loss that many admitted they did not even know who the Democratic challenger was.\n An informal dinner party at the Georgetown apartment of Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, turned into a celebration.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I never thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d see the day that Eric Cantor would be losing his primary,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Representative Louise M. Slaughter of New York, the senior Democrat on the House Rules Committee.\n Ms. Pelosi said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I still can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even believe it.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Chris Christie's campaign and a state Republican Party committee, escalating their probe into allegations that his aides created traffic jams as political payback.\n Mark Sheridan, the attorney representing Christie's campaign, confirmed to Fox News that the campaign and the Republican State Committee received subpoenas relating to the closure of traffic lanes near the George Washington Bridge last year.\n \"We can confirm that the Christie for Governor re-election campaign and the New Jersey Republican State Committee received subpoenas for documents from the U.S. Attorney's office, in addition to the subpoena the campaign previously received from the state legislative committee,\" he said. \"All three subpoenas focus on the closure of lanes on the George Washington Bridge. The campaign and the state party intend to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney's office and the state legislative committee and will respond to the subpoenas accordingly.\"\n The subpoenas were disclosed Thursday, the same day the Republican governor's campaign announced it had hired the Washington, D.C., law firm Patton Boggs in the case. Sheridan works for the firm and is general counsel for the state Republican committee.\n A state legislative committee investigating the traffic jams has also issued subpoenas to the two organizations.\n The federal subpoenas are due Feb. 5. The state committee subpoenas must be returned Feb. 3.\n Earlier this month, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said only that his office was reviewing the matter \"to determine whether a federal law was implicated.\"\n The traffic lanes were closed for four days in September, creating traffic gridlock in Fort Lee, the town at the base of the bridge on the New Jersey side. Emails and text messages turned over to legislators suggest it may have been a message to the town's Democratic mayor for not endorsing Christie.\n",

Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine who capitalized on his straight-arrow image to win a seat in Congress, was expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges after a lengthy corruption investigation, people with knowledge of the case said on Friday.\n The charges against Mr. Grimm, 44, a Republican who was first elected in 2010 and represents Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, were expected to include mail fraud and wire fraud, and to focus largely on his conduct in connection with a health food restaurant he owned on the Upper East Side of Manhattan after he left the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2006, two of the people said. He was also expected to be charged with obstruction of justice, for allegedly lying under oath in a federal lawsuit.\n The investigation of the second-term congressman, by the F.B.I. and the United States attorney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office in Brooklyn, began more than two years ago with an examination of Mr. Grimm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fund-raising for his 2010 race and expanded. Two of his fund-raisers have already been charged. One, Diana Durand of Houston, was charged with illegally funneling more than $10,000 into his campaign. The other, Ofer Biton, pleaded guilty to visa fraud charges.\n But on Friday, it did not appear that the indictment would include any campaign finance charges or accusations that the congressman had misused his office, although several of the people noted that the investigation was continuing. They all spoke on the condition of anonymity as the charges had not been formally announced and they were not authorized to discuss the case.\n A lawyer for Mr. Grimm, William McGinley of Patton Boggs, confirmed in a statement that prosecutors intended to file criminal charges against his client and said that Mr. Grimm \u00e2\u20ac\u0153asserts his innocence\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and that the investigation was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a politically driven vendetta.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After more than two years of investigation plagued by malicious leaks, violations of grand jury secrecy and strong-arm tactics, the U.S. attorney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office has disclosed its intent to file criminal charges against Congressman Grimm,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. McGinley said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When the dust settles, he will be vindicated. Until then, he will continue to serve his constituents with the same dedication and tenacity that has characterized his lifetime of public service as a member of Congress, Marine Corps combat veteran and decorated F.B.I. special agent.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Spokesmen for the office of the United States attorney in Brooklyn, Loretta E. Lynch, and for the New York F.B.I. office declined to comment.\n Mr. Grimm, the only Republican member of New York City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s congressional delegation, is up for re-election in November and faces a potentially formidable challenger in former City Councilman Domenic M. Recchia Jr., a Democrat who headed the Council\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Finance Committee and was Christine C. Quinn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief lieutenant when she was Council speaker. Healthalicious, the restaurant that the people said was a focus of the indictment, was on Second Avenue near 83rd Street. The company Mr. Grimm formed to operate it was called Granny Sayz, L.L.C., and was affiliated with a company connected to Mr. Biton, the fund-raiser.\n In January 2012, the New York State Workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Compensation Board ordered Healthalicious to pay $88,000 for not carrying workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 compensation insurance. About a year earlier, two former deliverymen hired a lawyer who contacted Mr. Grimm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s congressional office to complain that the restaurant had paid them less than minimum wage, did not pay for work beyond 40 hours per week and paid them in cash to evade scrutiny. Shortly afterward, Mr. Grimm filed papers with the state to dissolve Granny Sayz. The lawyer eventually sued Granny Sayz in federal court.\n Mr. Grimm over time developed something of a reputation for being hot-tempered, which did not set him apart from many others in Congress. But this year, during an encounter with a television reporter, he set a new standard for on-air congressional misbehavior and delivered a bizarre threat.\n After President Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s State of the Union address, NY1\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Washington reporter, Michael Scotto, interviewed the congressman about the speech. When he asked about the federal campaign financing investigation, Mr. Grimm stormed off camera but returned and threatened to throw Mr. Scotto off the balcony. Then, the congressman, speaking in a barely audible whisper as he stood close to the reporter, said Mr. Scotto was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not man enough\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll break you in half. Like a boy.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

But the lawsuit from Nebraska and Oklahoma, where marijuana is still outlawed, argues that Colorado has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153created a dangerous gap\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d in the federal drug-control system.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Marijuana flows from this gap into neighboring states,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the suit says, undermining their marijuana bans, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153draining their treasuries, and placing stress on their criminal justice systems.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n For months, some sheriffs and police officers in rural counties bordering Colorado have complained that they have seen more marijuana entering their towns and being transported down their highways since recreational sales began in January. Oklahoma and Nebraska said the influx had led to more arrests, more impounded vehicles and higher jail and court costs. They say it has also forced law-enforcement agencies to spend more time and dedicate more resources to handling marijuana-related arrests.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing a lot of marijuana coming over from Colorado,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Sheriff Adam Hayward of Deuel County, Neb., who said that he was gratified that the two states were challenging Colorado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s marijuana laws. He has complained that marijuana arrests have strained his jail budget. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the longest time we were saying, this is becoming a problem for us.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Colorado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorney general, John Suthers, a Republican, said in a statement that the challenge from Nebraska and Oklahoma was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153without merit.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Like many elected officials in Colorado, Mr. Suthers had opposed Amendment 64, which legalized marijuana. But on Thursday, he said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we will vigorously defend\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d against the lawsuit attempting to undo it.\n Nebraska and Oklahoma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s challenge is aimed more at the commercial side of marijuana legalization, which created new systems of regulations and taxes as well as recreational stores, dispensaries and production facilities that are monitored and licensed by state officials. The suit does not specifically seek to overturn the portion of Amendment 64 that made marijuana legal for personal use and possession, meaning that portions of legalization could survive even if Nebraska and Oklahoma prevail.\n But marijuana advocates said that the challenge \u00e2\u20ac\u201d if it succeeds at shutting down marijuana retailers \u00e2\u20ac\u201d could boost the black market.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If Nebraska and Oklahoma succeed, they will put the violent criminal organizations back in charge,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Michael Elliott, the executive director of the Marijuana Industry Group, a Colorado-based trade group, said in a statement.\n The lawsuit, which was brought by Nebraska\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorney general, Jon Bruning, and Oklahoma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorney general, Scott Pruitt, accused Colorado officials of participating in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scheme\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d that cultivates, packages and distributes marijuana in direct violation of controlled-substances laws while \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ignoring every objective embodied in the federal drug control regulation.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d It was filed directly with the Supreme Court because it involves a dispute among states.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Constitution and the federal antidrug laws do not permit the development of a patchwork of state and local pro-drug policies and licensed distribution schemes throughout the country,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the lawsuit says.\n Nebraska and Oklahoma accused Colorado of leaving huge holes in marijuana rules that allowed the plant to flow out of state.\n While it is against the law to take legally purchased marijuana across state lines, Nebraska and Oklahoma said that Colorado does not require consumers to smoke or eat their marijuana where they buy it, and said that despite purchasing and possession limits, anyone can easily visit several dispensaries and stock up. Some sheriffs in bordering states say they have pulled over drivers and found edibles and marijuana from multiple Colorado retail outlets.\n They also criticized Colorado for not tracking marijuana once it is sold, and for not requiring marijuana buyers to undergo criminal background checks (under Colorado law, anyone 21 or older can legally purchase recreational marijuana). Colorado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rules have no way to prevent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels from acquiring marijuana inventory directly from retail marijuana stores,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the lawsuit says.\n Nebraska and Oklahoma complained about a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant influx of Colorado-sourced marijuana,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d but the suit did not mention specific statistics about Colorado-related marijuana arrests or drug seizures. In earlier interviews, some local law-enforcement officers along Colorado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borders said that they had not seen an increase in marijuana coming from Colorado.\n",

Jan Brewer, a Republican, faced pressure from many corners to veto the measure, which has cast unwanted national attention on Arizona.\n Elected officials, civic leaders and business groups spoke out publicly against the measure, which passed both houses of the Legislature on Thursday.\n On Twitter, Arizona\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s United States senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, also Republicans, had nearly identical posts, with both of them saying they hoped Ms. Brewer would veto the bill. An executive from Apple Inc., which plans to build a big manufacturing plant in Mesa, called Ms. Brewer to urge her to reject it, and W. Douglas Parker, chairman and chief executive of American Airlines, sent her a letter citing the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic comeback\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is genuine concern throughout the business community that this bill, if signed into law, would jeopardize all that has been accomplished so far.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Their calls were echoed by three Republican state senators \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Adam Driggs, Steve Pierce and Bob Worsley, all members of the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conservative camp \u00e2\u20ac\u201d who had helped pass the legislation in the first place. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While our sincere intent in voting for this bill was to create a shield for all citizens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 religious liberties, the bill has instead been mischaracterized by its opponents as a sword of religious intolerance,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the senators said in a letter to Ms. Brewer, adding that the matter was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153causing our state immeasurable harm.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The bill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remaining supporters took to the airwaves and the Internet to defend it. Cathi Herrod, president of the Center for Arizona Policy, an architect of the bill, issued a news release calling attacks on the legislation \u00e2\u20ac\u0153politics at its absolute worse,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Instead of having an honest discussion about the true meaning of religious liberty, opponents of the bill have hijacked this discussion through lies, personal attacks, and irresponsible reporting.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Ms. Brewer was in Washington on Monday but was scheduled to return Tuesday to Phoenix, where she will have until the end of the week to act on the bill. Her spokesman, Andrew Wilder, suggested that she would not take that long, but he would not say what she was inclined to do.\n The religion bill comes as Arizona prepares to host the Super Bowl next year and struggles to regain its economic vitality. From Washington on Monday, Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, a Democrat, told Ronan Farrow of MSNBC that if Ms. Brewer signs the measure, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the N.F.L. may be looking, or maybe should be looking, to move the Super Bowl out of the state.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n And Barry Broome, president and chief executive of the Greater Phoenix Economic Council, said that leaders of four companies looking to relocate to Arizona had put his organization on notice, saying they might reconsider if the bill became law. The state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s image is still scarred by a divisive immigration law passed in 2010, which gave police officers the ability to stop people whom they suspected of being in the country illegally, and triggered widespread boycotts.\n Among the Republicans vying to succeed Ms. Brewer, who cannot run for re-election because of term limits, there was broad consensus against the measure, which would expand the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definition of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exercise of religion\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d to protect businesses and citizens from lawsuits after denying services on religious grounds.\n One candidate, Scott Smith, the mayor of Mesa, who is a Mormon, said that the bill \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gives carte blanche for anybody to discriminate under the guise of religion.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Another candidate, Doug Ducey, the state treasurer, qualified his view, saying that he would veto the bill but then \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bring together all the interested parties before this legislative session adjourns to forge consensus on acceptable language protecting religious liberty.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Wilder, the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman, said Ms. Brewer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office had received more than 10,000 calls and emails on the matter as of Monday morning.\n",

Michael Grimm's attorney confirmed late Friday that federal prosecutors plan to file criminal charges against the congressman.\n The decision follows a two-year FBI investigation into various aspects of Grimm's business and campaign history.\n \"We are disappointed by the government's decision, but hardly surprised,\" said the statement from Grimm's attorney, William McGinley. \"From the beginning, the government has pursued a politically driven vendetta against Congressman Grimm and not an independent search for the truth.\"\n The statement said Grimm \"asserts his innocence of any wrongdoing\" and \"will be vindicated.\"\n \"Until then, he will continue to serve his constituents with the same dedication and tenacity that has characterized his lifetime of public service as a Member of Congress, Marine Corps combat veteran, and decorated FBI Special Agent,\" the statement said.\n The House Ethics Committee announced in November that Grimm was under investigation for possible campaign finance violations. That committee said it would defer its inquiry because of a separate Department of Justice investigation.\n A spokesman for the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn said he could not confirm, deny or comment on the case.\n Grimm made headlines in January after confronting a New York City cable news station reporter who tried to question him about a long-running FBI investigation into campaign finance on a balcony in the Capitol.\n After reporter Michael Scotto finished his report, Grimm stormed back, leaned into him and said, \"Let me be clear to you. If you ever do that to me again, I'll throw you off this (expletive) balcony.\"\n Scotto, who was asking about fundraising during Grimm's first campaign, protested, saying he was asking \"a valid question.\"\n During that race, Grimm has acknowledged receiving $250,000 to $300,000 in contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto. Some members of Pinto's congregation subsequently said they made tens of thousands of dollars in illegal contributions, including gifts passed through straw donors.\n Grimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties, and the FBI hasn't accused him of any wrongdoing. The Israeli businessman who had served as Grimm's liaison to Pinto's followers, Ofer Biton, pleaded guilty in August to an immigration fraud charge.\n Three days after that guilty plea, the FBI filed a sealed criminal complaint accusing a Houston woman who had been romantically involved with Grimm of using straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions.\n In that case, made public this month, the woman was accused of funneling at least $10,000 to Grimm's campaign by passing them through friends who agreed to have the donations listed under their names.\n A spokesman in Grimm's Washington office, Nick Iacono, did not immediately return emails or a telephone message seeking comment Friday.\n",

Boehner of Ohio and other Republican leaders are expected to release a one-page statement of immigration principles this week at their annual retreat in Cambridge, Md., according to aides with knowledge of the plan. The document is expected to call for border security and enforcement measures, as well as providing a path to legal status \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but not citizenship \u00e2\u20ac\u201d for many of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, the aides said.\n The Republican effort comes as Mr. Obama is expected to push once again for an overhaul of the immigration system in his State of the Union address Tuesday, and as lawmakers from both parties describe immigration as one of the few potential areas for bipartisan compromise before the end of the current Congress.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The principles they lay out I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t satisfy everybody,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Michael R. Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City, said at an immigration forum on Friday. But, he added, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if we can make some compromises here for the good of the country, I think we have a very good chance for the first time in a long time of changing something that is really damaging all of us.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The Senate, led by Democrats, passed a broad bipartisan measure in June to overhaul immigration that included a 13-year path to citizenship. But the legislation stalled in the Republican-controlled House, where some of the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more conservative members oppose any form of legal status as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153amnesty.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But heading into the three-day Republican retreat, even some of the most ardent conservatives say consensus is forming around an immigration package that would include several separate bills on border security; a clampdown against the hiring of undocumented workers; expanded guest-worker programs; a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants brought to the country as children; and a path to legal status for undocumented workers with family ties to citizens or employer sponsors.\n The White House has said it wants a path to citizenship for both children and adults in any new immigration legislation.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pathway to citizenship is a stumbling block,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Representative Andy Harris, a conservative Republican who represents the Maryland district that will host the retreat. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But legalization with no path to citizenship can gain some votes.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Representative Peter T. King, a Republican of New York and a longtime critic of proposals to change the immigration system, said it was significant that both the third-ranking Republican in the House, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, and the Judiciary Committee chairman, Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, had voiced support in recent days for legal status for some immigrants living in the country illegally \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and have taken very little heat for their remarks on either side of the aisle.\n But the divisions that have slowed progress in the House have not been entirely mended. Representative Ra\u00c3\u00bal R. Labrador, a Republican of Idaho and once a leading immigration negotiator in the House, said it would be a mistake to push forward.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The president has shown he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not willing to work with us on immigration,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Labrador said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not worth having a party divided when we have so many issues we can come together on.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n On Thursday, aides to House conservatives who oppose the leadership\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan gathered in the office of Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and a fierce opponent of the immigration push, to plot a strategy to torpedo it.\n Critics worry that House Republican leaders and Senate Democrats are essentially negotiating a final deal, bypassing formal House-Senate negotiations, where conservatives had hoped to derail the process. Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, one of the Democratic architects of the Senate bill, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One thing is certain, just as with the budget, at some point both the House and the Senate will have to sit down and resolve all the contentious issues.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

The Obama administration intended the trip to underscore its commitment to civil rights in general and the Ferguson case in particular.\n \"I understand that mistrust,\" Holder said. \"I am the attorney general of the United States. But I am also a black man.\" The attorney general then described how he was stopped twice on the New Jersey Turnpike and accused of speeding. Police searched his car, going through the trunk and looking under the seats.\n \"I remember how humiliating that was and how angry I was and the impact it had on me,\" Holder said.\n Holder also described how once, while living in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, he was running to catch a movie with his cousin when a squad car rolled up and flashed its lights at the pair. The officer yelled, \"Where are you going? Hold it!\" Holder recalled.\n His cousin \"started mouthing off,\" and Holder urged him to be quiet.\n \"We negotiate the whole thing, and we walk to our movie. At the time that he stopped me, I was a federal prosecutor. I wasn't a kid,\" he said.\n While in Ferguson, Holder met with federal officials investigating the case, as well as Brown's parents. He also met with Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who has been in charge of security in Ferguson for nearly a week. The National Guard is also helping to keep the peace.\n On Wednesday night, a diminished number of protesters marched around a single block in Ferguson as a thunderstorm filled the sky with lighting and dumped rain. Police still stood guard, but many wore regular uniforms rather than riot gear.\n Johnson said there were six arrests Wednesday, compared to 47 the previous night. He called it \"a very good night,\" and said Holder's visit had let people know their voices had been heard.\n In nearby Clayton, a grand jury began hearing evidence to determine whether Wilson should be charged in Brown's death. A spokesman for St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch said there was no timeline for the process, but it could take weeks.\n Outside the St. Louis County Justice Center, where the grand jury convened, two dozen protesters gathered in a circle for a prayer, chanted and held signs urging McCulloch to step aside.\n McCulloch's deep family connections to police have been cited by some black leaders who question his ability to be impartial in the case. McCulloch's father, mother, brother, uncle and cousin all worked for the St. Louis Police Department, and his father was killed while responding to a call involving a black suspect.\n The prosecutor, who is white, has insisted his background will have no bearing on the handling of the Brown case, which has touched off days of nighttime protests during which authorities used tear gas and rubber bullets to clear the streets.\n On Wednesday, police said an officer had been suspended for pointing a semi-automatic assault rifle at demonstrators, then cursing and threatening to kill one of them. A protester captured the exchange on video Tuesday and posted it to YouTube and other websites.\n",

Labrador, a Republican of Idaho who has barely served two terms in Congress, jumped into the race for House majority leader on Friday, offering himself as the more conservative alternative who could pull the House rightward in the wake of Representative Eric Cantor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loss in a primary.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The message from Tuesday is clear \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Americans are looking for a change in the status quo,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Labrador, a former immigration lawyer elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010, said in a statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153President Obama and the Democrats have had their chance and they have failed. Republicans must be willing to take these challenges head on with new leadership, fresh ideas and a different approach.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n While some of those conservative lawmakers elected in 2010 were hoping that the House leadership elections on Thursday would offer them the chance to reclaim their influence on Capitol Hill, few of them give Mr. Labrador much of a chance against the current House majority whip, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California. Though Tea Party activists provided the energy and votes for Mr. Cantor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ouster, the elections might be more of a plea for a place at the leadership table.\n Supporters of Mr. McCarthy, who confidently traveled home to his district in Bakersfield for the weekend, said Friday that the Californian had all but sewed up the votes he needs.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have got to have an alternative,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Representative Louie Gohmert, Republican of Texas, said on Glenn Beck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conservative radio show. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I mean, for us as a party in Congress to send the message that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t learn a blessed thing from this amazing election result, we aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t paying attention.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n House conservatives \u00e2\u20ac\u201d lacking a rationale to fight Mr. McCarthy, a well-liked member of leadership who has raised millions of dollars for Republican incumbents \u00e2\u20ac\u201d have begun protesting that his voting record is actually to the left of Mr. Cantor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.\n FreedomWorks, which has provided financial support for Tea Party candidates, immediately began trying to generate support for Mr. Labrador through its websites and email lists. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now that grass-roots conservatives FIRED Eric Cantor, we need a new majority leader in the House of Representatives,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d FreedomWorks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 website said Friday.\n Matt Kibbe, the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president and chief executive, said that he did not have great qualms with Mr. McCarthy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ideology, but that he was more about politics than ideas. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Republican penchant for just choosing the next guy in line hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t proven to be a great strategy, and it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t picked good leadership,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Kibbe said.\n But Mr. Labrador\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s path to victory is steep, especially in the few days before House Republicans gather to elect Mr. Cantor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacement. Mr. McCarthy has been preparing for months to move up from No. 3 in the Republican leadership to No. 2 in the event that Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio would retire after the November elections.\n Conservative Republicans in the House pleaded Friday for a delay in the voting. Some grumbled that the campaign by the college professor David Brat to unseat Mr. Cantor had ousted the one member of House Republican leadership willing to listen to the House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most conservative members. Instead, the House will end up elevating a leader with a less conservative record and less patience for the far-right flank.\n For his part, Mr. Boehner has remained firm that he wanted to get it done quickly and minimize disruption.\n Mr. McCarthy spent much of the day calling members and shoring up support, said a Republican aide close to the majority whip. McCarthy supporters predicted that Mr. Labrador would muster no more than a few dozen votes.\n Some lawmakers questioned whether his run was really a quest to win the majority leader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post or merely to raise his own profile. His decision to jump in was widely seen as proof that more experienced conservative members, like Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio or Tom Price of Georgia, had rebuffed overtures to run from other conservatives.\n Tea Party groups off Capitol Hill may believe Mr. Labrador can win, and they will pressure House conservatives to join the campaign. But ultimately, supporting him could hurt more conservative members with the House leadership.\n Mr. Labrador tried on Friday to at least engage the Republican conference in a debate over ideas. He said the party needed to address issues like upward income mobility among the poor and middle-class economic insecurity. Born the son of a single mother in Puerto Rico, he has seen himself as an ambassador to young and minority voters out of reach to traditional Republicans.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am running for majority leader because I want to help create a vision of growth and opportunity for everyone and start getting to work for the American people,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, rushed to champion Mr. Labrador\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s candidacy. Mr. Amash, after all, voted last year to make him speaker of the House.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t respond to a stunning loss by giving a pat on the back and promotion to the same team,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Amash said of Mr. Cantor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defeat. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for someone new, someone conservative, someone who will put forward a fresh agenda, and someone we know is a proven and talented spokesman.

In a statement, he said he intends to defend the state's marijuana laws.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Because neighboring states have expressed concern about Colorado-grown marijuana coming into their states, we are not entirely surprised by this action,\" Suthers said. \"However, it appears the plaintiffs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 primary grievance stems from non-enforcement of federal laws regarding marijuana, as opposed to choices made by the voters of Colorado. We believe this suit is without merit and we will vigorously defend against it in the U.S. Supreme Court.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Bruning, along with Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, argue that under the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause, Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional because marijuana remains illegal under federal law. The clause states that in general, federal law takes precedence over state law.\n \"The illegal products being distributed in Colorado are being trafficked across state lines thereby injuring neighboring states like Oklahoma and Nebraska,\" Pruitt said in a statement.\n The regulation of recreational marijuana -- as seen in programs currently in place in Colorado and Washington state, as well as those that will soon go into effect in Oregon and Alaska -- remains illegal under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act. The states that have legalized marijuana or softened penalties for possession have only been able to do so because of federal guidance urging federal prosecutors to refrain from targeting state-legal marijuana operations.\n Colorado voters approved Amendment 64, legalizing recreational marijuana in the state, in 2012. The first retail marijuana shops opened their doors on New Years Day 2014. To date, 23 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medical purposes. Four states have legalized recreational marijuana, along with voters in D.C. -- though the D.C. measure is the subject of a congressional Republican effort to block its implementation.\n With a majority of Americans now supporting marijuana legalization, and with states continuing to pass legalization laws, it seems unlikely that the federal government would push back against the legalizations. But it's not impossible. If the Supreme Court were to rule in favor of Nebraska and Oklahoma, all state marijuana laws, in any form, could be in jeopardy of being unraveled.\n Harvard economist Jeff Miron, a vocal supporter of marijuana policy reform, highlighted the precarious nature of state marijuana laws in a November op-ed for CNN, saying that Congress needs to act now on federal marijuana policy.\n \"Despite the compelling case for legalization, and progress toward legalization at the state level, ultimate success is not assured,\" Miron wrote. \"Federal law still prohibits marijuana, and existing jurisprudence (Gonzales v. Raich 2005) holds that federal law trumps state law when it comes to marijuana prohibition. So far, the federal government has mostly taken a hands-off approach to state medicalizations and legalizations, but in January 2017, the country will have a new president. That person could order the attorney general to enforce federal prohibition regardless of state law.\"\n Kevin Sabet, president of anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, applauded the action by Nebraska and Oklahoma.\n \"We support this action by the attorneys general of Oklahoma and Nebraska because Colorado's decisions regarding marijuana are not without consequences to neighboring states, and indeed all Americans,\" Sabet said. \"The legalization of marijuana is clearly in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act and is not implemented in a vacuum.\"\n Mason Tvert, communications director for Marijuana Policy Project, told The Huffington Post that MPP agrees with Suthers' opinion that the suit is \"without merit.\"\n \"Nebraska officials are acting like bullies, and they have no business trying to dictate Colorado's marijuana laws,\" Tvert said to HuffPost. \"They are wasting their taxpayers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dollars by filing this suit and forcing Coloradans to pick up the bill for defending our state against it. Colorado's top law enforcement officials have better things to do and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d think Nebraska\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s would, as well. These guys are on the wrong side of history.\"\n Marijuana Industry Group's Mike Elliott echoed Tvert's sentiments, adding that despite the multi-decade federal war on drugs, marijuana remains \"universally available\" -- including in Nebraska and Oklahoma.\n \"If Nebraska and Oklahoma succeed, they will put the violent criminal organizations back in charge,\" Elliott said.\n Rep.

The complaint says the measure runs afoul of federal law and therefore violates the Constitution's supremacy clause, which says federal laws trump state laws.\n Colorado Attorney General John Suthers said the lawsuit was without merit.\n \"Because neighboring states have expressed concern about Colorado-grown marijuana coming into their states, we are not entirely surprised by this action,\" he said. \"However, it appears the plaintiffs' primary grievance stems from non-enforcement of federal laws regarding marijuana, as opposed to choices made by the voters of Colorado.\"\n The lawsuit says Colorado marijuana flows into neighboring states undermining their efforts to enforce their anti-marijuana laws.\n \"This contraband has been heavily trafficked into our state,\" Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning said at a news conference in Lincoln. \"While Colorado reaps millions from the sale of pot, Nebraska taxpayers have to bear the cost.\"\n Colorado has raised more than $60 million in taxes, licenses and fees from medical and recreational marijuana, which has been sold in stores since January.\n The lawsuit says the sales have strained Nebraska and Oklahoma's finances and legal systems. Police are spending more time and money making arrests, housing inmates, impounding vehicles, seizing drugs and handling other problems related to Colorado pot.\n Bruning, a Republican, blamed U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder for failing to enforce the federal law's ban on drugs in Colorado.\n In a policy statement last year, the U.S. Justice Department noted it doesn't have the resources to police all violations of federal marijuana law. It laid out eight federal law enforcement priorities that states need to protect if they want to authorize \"marijuana-related conduct.\" They include keeping marijuana in-state \u00e2\u20ac\u201d something Oklahoma and Nebraska says Colorado has failed to do. The suit doesn't contain statistics to support the claim.\n Law enforcement agencies have long said anecdotally that they are feeling the impacts of Colorado's legal weed, making more marijuana arrests and seizing more of the drug.\n But there's no way to know exactly how much legal pot is leaving Colorado.\n The Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area wrote in a recent report that the amount of Colorado pot seized on highways increased from an annual average of 2,763 pounds between 2005 and 2008 to a yearly average of 3,690 pounds from 2009 to 2013. The weed was headed for at least 40 different states.\n Scotts Bluff County Sheriff Mark Overman, in western Nebraska, said Colorado marijuana is extra potent, making it worth more in his region and giving sellers a greater financial incentive to do business there.\n \"I think this is overdue, and I think other states should jump on board,\" Overman said of the lawsuit. \"I'm very frustrated. I take an oath of office, as does every other police officer in this country. I don't just get to pick and choose which laws I enforce.\"\n Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper told The Denver Post he spoke with Nebraska and Oklahoma officials about their concerns.\n \"I'm not sure filing a lawsuit is the most constructive way to find a solution to whatever issues they are,\" he said.\n Legal scholars say it's too early to know how the Supreme Court might handle the case or if it will even accept it.\n \"Right now, these regulations exist in legal no-man's-land,\" said Sam Kamin, a University of Denver law professor. \"It's incredibly unusual for a state to be suing another state. (The lawsuit) certainly was a surprise to me given the movement at the federal level, which seems to be in favor of allowing states to experiment.\"\n It was unclear if other neighboring states would take similar action. Attorneys general in Utah and New Mexico said they had no immediate plans to join the suit.\n Brian Vicente, a Colorado attorney and legalization advocate who wrote Amendment 64, said the challenge is \"political grandstanding\" without merit. He said 23 states have enacted medical marijuana laws, and none have been overturned because of federal law.\n \"I think it shows they are on the wrong side of history,\" Vicente said. \"Colorado voters passed this measure, and more and more states are passing these laws. If the attorney general has a problem with how federal laws are being enforced he should bring that up with the U.S. attorney.\"\n",

Jan Brewer to veto bill allowing denial of service to gays\n\nPUBLISHED: 2014/02/26\n\nProminent Republicans are calling for Ariz. Gov. Jan Brewer to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service over religious beliefs.\n The Republican governor returned home Tuesday afternoon to a political climate that is much different from just a week ago when she left for Washington the last five days for a governor's conference.\n The Arizona Legislature passed a bill last week allowing businesses whose owners cite sincerely held religious beliefs to deny service to gays. It allows any business, church or person to cite the law as a defense in any action brought by the government or individual claiming discrimination.\n The legislation has caused a national uproar. The chorus of opposition has grown each day, with the business community, the state's Super Bowl Committee and both Republican U.S. senators calling for a veto. Former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney was the latest prominent voice to weigh in and urge Brewer to veto the bill.\n Brewer will likely spend the next day or more pondering Senate Bill 1062 before deciding whether to sign or veto the legislation.\n There is widespread speculation that Brewer will veto the bill, but she has not said how she'll act, as is her longtime practice with pending legislation.\n Political observers in Arizona cautioned that the governor is deliberate and not prone to act hastily, despite the growing calls from business, politicians of all stripes, and civil rights groups for a veto.\n \"She's no rookie to these high-profile deals \u00e2\u20ac\u201d she gives both sides their due,\" said Doug Cole, a political consultant whose firm has run all of Brewer's campaigns for decades.\n \"She's going to get a very detailed briefing from her legal team, and give the proponents their best shot, and the opponents their best shot,\" he said. \"Everybody's going to get their say, and they've giving it.\"\n Some Republican senators who pushed the bill through the Legislature are now calling for a veto as well, but they cite \"inaccurate\" information about the measure for igniting a firestorm. They argue the bill is designed only to protect business owners with strong religious beliefs from discrimination lawsuits that have happened in other states. Some blame the media for blowing the law out of proportion.\n Democrats say that argument doesn't wash and call SB1062 \"toxic\" legislation that allows discrimination. They said they warned Republicans who voted for the bill that it was destined for trouble.\n \"We brought this to their attention five weeks ago,\" said Sen. Steve Gallardo, D-Phoenix. \"We said this is exactly what is going to happen. You have a bill here that's so toxic it's going to divide this Legislature. It's going to be polarizing the entire state. And that's exactly what happened.\"\n The bill was pushed by the Center for Arizona Policy, a social conservative group that opposes abortion and gay marriage. The group says the proposal simply clarifies existing state law and is needed to protect against increasingly activist federal courts.\n The center's president, Cathi Herrod, has been deriding what she called \"fear-mongering\" from the measure's opponents.\n \"What's happened is our opponents have employed a new political tactic, and it's working,\" she said. \"Throw out the threat of a boycott to attempt to defeat a bill, and you might just be able to be successful.\n Herrod added she was surprised and disappointed that \"in America today, false attacks and irresponsible characterizations about a piece of legislation can so intimidate and persuade people to change their opinion about religious liberty.\"\n",

After many hours of prayer, talking to my parents, and re-reading my words online I can see more clearly just how hurtful my words were. ... I pledge to learn and grow (and I assure you I have) from this experience.\"\n The Washington Post reported that Lauten had confirmed that she had made both Facebook postings attributed to her.

Holder Jr. arrived in St. Louis on Wednesday, meeting with community leaders and federal investigators even as local law enforcement officials said they were hopeful that they had turned a corner in calming the restive community of Ferguson after 12 days of protests and unrest.\n Mr. Holder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first stop was at a community college, where he met with people who told him about their own personal experiences with the local police, some of which they said helped fuel the rage that was ultimately ignited by the shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer on Aug. 9.\n There were more protests planned throughout the day and into the evening, but Capt. Ronald S. Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol said he believed they had reached \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a turning point.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Captain Johnson, whose agency is overseeing security here, said there were only sporadic problems on Tuesday night, and none of the wide-scale looting and confrontations that had erupted on other nights. Still, the police did make 47 arrests overnight.\n As the tension on the street seemed to ease, the focus turned to the investigation into the shooting death of Michael Brown.\n A grand jury has been convened and was scheduled to meet Wednesday to begin hearing evidence, said Edward Magee, a spokesman for Robert P. McCulloch, the prosecuting attorney for St. Louis County.\n Protesters gathered outside Mr. McCulloch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office on Wednesday, calling for him to step aside. They argued that he could not be impartial because his father, a police officer, was shot and killed by a black man while on duty when Mr. McCulloch was a child.\n Mr. McCulloch, speaking to a local radio station, categorically rejected that notion.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I know the pain the Brown family is going through right now,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n He said he has only one interest: conducting a fair and thorough investigation. But he acknowledged that Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri has the power to appoint a new prosecutor.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anyone who wants me off the case needs to call up the governor and express their opinion to him,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. McCulloch told KTRS radio.\n By failing to act, Mr. McCulloch said, the governor \u00e2\u20ac\u0153undermines everything except the cover he has pulled over his head.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d He told him to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153man up\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and make a decision so that the case will not be further delayed.\n Mr. Magee cautioned that it could take weeks for the grand jury to consider all of the evidence. He said that Officer Darren Wilson, who shot Mr. Brown, had been interviewed by police investigators and would be given the opportunity to testify.\n The Justice Department, meanwhile, has started a separate inquiry. More than 40 F.B.I. agents have been dispatched to Ferguson, and Mr. Holder said they are not only investigating the shooting but also looking for any broad patterns of civil rights violations.\n In an open letter to the people of Ferguson, Mr. Holder said he understood the desire of residents for an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153independent\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d inquiry.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is my pledge to the people of Ferguson: Our investigation into this matter will be full, it will be fair, and it will be independent,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Holder wrote in The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And beyond the investigation itself, we will work with the police, civil rights leaders, and members of the public to ensure that this tragedy can give rise to new understanding \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and robust action \u00e2\u20ac\u201d aimed at bridging persistent gaps between law enforcement officials and the communities we serve.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The frustrations in the community have been fueled in part by the slow pace with which the authorities have released information.\n In a sign of just how deep the distrust runs, there were three separate autopsies performed on Mr. Brown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body: one by the county medical examiner, one by a private pathologist hired by the family, and one by federal authorities.\n In addition to the many lingering questions about the shooting, the local authorities have also come under criticism for how they have handled the protests.\n Norm Stamper, the former Seattle police chief who was in charge during the protests that rocked that city in 1999, said that the wrong tone was set from the first day in Ferguson.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The basic perspective that I have over this whole thing, dating back to the shooting incident itself, what we had were largely peaceful vigils and protests that were met with police tactics that were highly aggressive and militaristic,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That response ignited what we have seen all week.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He reserved his harshest criticism for the use of tear gas by the police \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a mistake he said he made in Seattle and one he regrets to this day.\n Since the first day of protests in Ferguson, the authorities shifted their response almost daily, adding to the sense that the situation was out of control.\n On one day, protesters were told to gather in one place. Another day, they were told to keep moving. Then a curfew was imposed. The next night, there was no curfew. The local police were in control; then another unit took over. The National Guard was finally brought in to try to temper the unrest, but its role was not exactly clear.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You get governors and police chiefs and everyone gnashing their teeth,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Stamper said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even the protesters are commenting on that: what are they doing?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n On Tuesday night, however, it seemed that some of that energy had gone from the streets. And the police also seemed more restrained, refraining from using tear gas.\n The evening began in a familiar fashion: Demonstrators marched along the street and chanted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hands up! Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shoot!\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and other slogans that have become common here since Mr. Brown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death.\n The authorities made at least 47 arrests after demonstrators tossed bottles toward police officers, some of whom used pepper spray to subdue some protesters. In some instances, teams of officers abruptly entered the crowd, detained a single person whom they had apparently focused on, and returned to West Florissant Avenue, where many of the recent confrontations have occurred.\n Although law enforcement officers in riot gear eyed the protesters while a police helicopter occasionally circled the city, there were no signs of trouble for long stretches of the evening.\n When a demonstration ended shortly before midnight, many of the demonstrators prayed.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what I call a good protest,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Jonathan Smith, 45, said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ending in a prayer, no gas in the air.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Chris Christie (R) and the New Jersey Republican State Committee, as part of its investigation into the \"Bridgegate\" scandal.\n In a statement issued Thursday, Mark Sheridan, a partner with Patton Boggs, said his law firm had been retained to represent both the campaign and the committee in connection with the investigation.\n \"We can confirm that the Christie for Governor re-election campaign and the New Jersey Republican State Committee received subpoenas for documents from the U.S. Attorney's office, in addition to the subpoena the campaign previously received from the state legislative committee,\" said Sheridan. \"All three subpoenas focus on the closure of lanes on the George Washington Bridge. The campaign and the state party intend to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney's office and the state legislative committee and will respond to the subpoenas accordingly.\"\n The Christie administration closed down two of the three George Washington Bridge access lanes in Fort Lee, N.J., in September, in what appeared to be a political retribution scheme aimed at the borough's Democratic mayor. The closures, which lasted for four days, caused massive traffic jams. They were orchestrated by a Christie ally at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, David Wildstein, along with one of Christie's deputy chiefs of staff, Bridget Kelly, and his then-campaign manager and top political adviser, Bill Stepien.\n Christie has maintained that he had no involvement in, or knowledge of, the plan.\n The New Jersey state legislature is also investigating the lane closures. The FBI and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, meanwhile, are looking into separate controversies over whether the Christie administration misused Hurricane Sandy relief dollars.\n",

John McCain (R-Ariz.) suggested Thursday that Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exclusive use of personal email while serving as secretary of state was hypocritical.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is the same individual that just excoriated the Bush administration for supposedly hiding communications within the administration,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d McCain said on MSNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Andrea Mitchell Reports.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n While serving as a senator from New York in 2007, Clinton criticized the Bush administration for its \"secrecy,\" according to The Hill. \"We know about the secret wiretaps, we know about the secret military tribunals, the secret White House email accounts,\" she said. \"It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a stunning record of secrecy and corruption, of cronyism run amok.\"\n Clinton, who is often described as the Democratic presidential frontrunner for 2016, has faced scrutiny since Monday when The New York Times reported that she may have violated federal records law by using a personal email account for all of her work messages as secretary of state. She served in that position from 2009 to 2013.\n Democrats came to her defense, and other media outlets soon pointed out that the rules against using personal email were not relayed to government officials until 2014. But likely GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush suggested that the use of personal email demonstrated a lack of transparency.\n Clinton responded to the controversy on Wednesday, tweeting that she had asked the State Department to make her private emails publicly available.\n While on Mitchell's show, McCain also raised the concern that there's no way of knowing if all of Clinton's emails have been saved, since they were not originally retained by the government.\n \"The question that I think's gonna rise over time is, how can we be confident that once she carries out what she tweeted -- that she wants all the emails known -- how are we gonna know that? How are we gonna have verification of that?\" McCain said. \"So I think this is serious. And I'm willing to give her or anyone who defends her the benefit of defending it or explaining it, but on its face, it seems to be rather serious.\"\n",

Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning government-funded travel to Indiana.\n The statements are the latest boycott threats to emerge over claims that the law has the potential to discriminate against gays and others.\n Murray, a Democrat who is openly gay, issued his ban via executive order over the weekend, and Inslee issued his Monday afternoon.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I find Indiana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new law disturbing, particularly at a time when more and more states and people in America are embracing civil rights for everyone,\" Inslee said in a statement. \"Washington will join other states and cities in opposing this law and I will impose an administration-wide ban on state-funded travel to Indiana.\"\n Murray says the law doesn't reflect Seattle residents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 values. He also has told all city departments to review their contracts to see whether Seattle is doing business with any company whose headquarters is in Indiana.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Seattleites know that discrimination has no place in our city,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said in a statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just equality 101.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The primary concern is that the law might allow a business to discriminate against gay residents, such as a baker being allowed refuse an order from a gay couple for a wedding cake.\n But state lawmakers and Republican Gov. Mike Pence have been defending and trying to explain the Religious Freedom Restoration Act ever since the governor signed it into law on Thursday. They note that then-President Bill Clinton in 1993 signed similar federal legislation into law, and 19 other states also have similar policies.\n However, the Indiana law differs in several ways, primarily in that it allows a business to assert a right to \"the free exercise of religion.\"\n On Monday, state Senate President Pro Tem David Long and House Speaker Brian Bosma, both Republicans, held a press conference to further explain the law. They said they will swiftly try to \"clarify\" its language.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The new law does not discriminate,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Long said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And it will not be allowed. To the extent that we need to clarify through legislative action, we plan to do just that.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Aside from Indiana, 15 other states have introduced legislation in 2015 to craft or alter their religious freedom laws. Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas have introduced legislation to amend their laws. Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, North Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming are looking to put a similar law on their books.\n Bosma acknowledged a major concern is whether businesses will now be legally permitted to deny services to some people, as a result of the law, and that even he is unclear.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that will be the effect,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are looking at options to clarify that that's the case.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Long and Bosma also conceded they called the press conference because Pence failed to clearly explain the law during an appearance Sunday on ABC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This Week.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Pence said the legislation prohibits Indiana laws that \"substantially burden\" a person's ability to follow his or her religious beliefs, with the definition of \"person\" including religious institutions, businesses and associations.\n However, he did not answer directly when asked six times whether, under the law, it would be legal for a merchant to refuse to serve gay customers.\n Long on Monday also denied that a clarification of the law would be needed before this weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s NCAA Final Four basketball championships, in Indianapolis.\n A record-breaking 158,682 people attended the games last year in Texas. And any boycott would have the potential to cut much anticipated revenue for Indianapolis-area hotels, restaurants and other businesses.\n The NCAA, whose headquarters is in Indianapolis, also has expressed concern about the law, as figures in corporate America and Hollywood voice their opposition.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are especially concerned about how this legislation could affect our student-athletes and employees,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said NCAA President Mark Emmert. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We intend to closely examine the implications of this bill and how it might affect future events as well as our workforce.\"\n Angie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s List, the business-rating website, this weekend put on hold plans to expand its Indianapolis headquarters.\n Actor George Takei is calling for a boycott. And actor Ashton Kutcher recently tweeted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Indiana are you also going to allow Christian establishments to ban Jews from coming in? Or Vice Versa? Religious freedom??? #OUTRAGE.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the committee chairman, said the committee is not interested in emails relating to personal or private matters, and instead will focus solely on those pertaining to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Libya and Benghazi during the relevant time periods.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Toward that end and because of the Secretary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unique arrangement with herself as it relates to public records during and after her tenure as Secretary of State, this Committee is left with no alternative but to request Secretary Clinton appear before this Committee for a transcribed interview to better understand decisions the Secretary made relevant to the creation, maintenance, retention, and ultimately deletion of public records,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Gowdy stated in the letter.\n Gowdy set a May 1 deadline for the interview.\n An interview, Gowdy argued, would provide protection for the likely 2016 presidential candidate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s privacy and security for sensitive information.\n The request comes after reports revealed Clinton used a private email address and a server located in her New York home during her time as secretary of state. Last week, Gowdy said Clinton did not respond to any of the subpoenas requesting documents in the case, and her lawyer had informed the committee that the server used for emails during her tenure had been wiped clean.\n Gowdy said once Clinton is interviewed and all documents related to the 2012 Benghazi attack are shared, the committee will schedule a time for Clinton to testify publicly in a hearing.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We share the Secretary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desire these two conversations take place as quickly and efficiently as possible, and are willing to expedite both working with your office, the Secretary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s schedule and our Democrat colleagues on the Committee,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Gowdy said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What the Committee cannot do is conclude its work without assurances the Committee has all relevant information necessary for us to discharge the duties required of us.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Gowdy went on to call Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s email situation \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly unusual, if not unprecedented,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and said it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exacerbates\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d lawmakers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 needs to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153understand what the Secretary did.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Earlier this month, Clinton said she had a private email account because she \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n She admitted that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153looking back,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d it would have been better to carry the second phone.\n Clinton is not the only government official to use a private email for work.

Rice, President Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national security adviser, sharply criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Tuesday over his plans to address a joint meeting of Congress next week, saying his actions had hurt his nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with the United States.\n Mr. Netanyahu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to travel to Washington to deliver the speech two weeks before the Israeli elections has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153injected a degree of partisanship, which is not only unfortunate, I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s destructive of the fabric of the relationship,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ms. Rice said in an interview on the PBS television program \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Charlie Rose.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Her comments marked the strongest public rebuke to date by the Obama administration since Mr. Netanyahu accepted an invitation from Speaker John A. Boehner to make his case to Congress against a nuclear deal with Iran, which is a priority of Mr. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. It is also the frankest acknowledgment yet by a top American official of the degree to which the controversy has damaged United States-Israeli relations.\n The speech, scheduled for March 3, was arranged by Mr. Boehner and the Israeli ambassador without consulting the White House \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a move that Mr. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team has called a breach of protocol.\n The president has said he will not meet with Mr. Netanyahu during his visit to avoid any appearance that he is trying to influence the Israeli elections that are scheduled for mid-March.\n The episode is a low point in the tense relationship between Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu and has touched off weeks of mostly anonymous sniping and finger-pointing.\n Top administration officials have hinted more openly of their displeasure in recent days.\n The White House on Wednesday said that Mr. Obama agreed with Ms. Rice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment, saying he had raised the same concerns several times.\n Her comments, said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153entirely consistent with what the president has already said.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Allowing this relationship to be subjected to party politics does weaken the relationship,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Earnest said.\n Mr. Earnest said he did not know whether Mr. Obama and Ms. Rice had talked in advance of the interview about what she would say about Mr. Netanyahu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit.\n Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who as president of the Senate would be expected to attend, has said he will be traveling abroad. Secretary of State John Kerry said Tuesday that he would be in Switzerland negotiating with the Iranians. The White House has also not committed to sending a representative next week to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conference, where Mr. Netanyahu is also scheduled to appear.\n The Israeli prime minister himself has turned down a request by Democratic senators for a private meeting, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said Tuesday.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We offered the prime minister an opportunity to balance the politically divisive invitation from Speaker Boehner with a private meeting with Democrats who are committed to keeping the bipartisan support of Israel strong,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Durbin said in a statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153His refusal to meet is disappointing to those of us who have stood by Israel for decades.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In a letter released by Mr. Durbin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office, Mr. Netanyahu said such a meeting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could compound the misperception of partisanship regarding my upcoming visit.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Netanyahu said Tuesday that he was making the trip because it was his obligation to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do everything I can to prevent\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d a nuclear agreement with Iran.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Therefore, I will go to Washington to address the American Congress, because the American Congress is likely to be the final brake before the agreement between the major powers and Iran,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said as he toured a military base in southern Israel.\n Ms. Rice demurred when asked whether she believed Mr. Netanyahu was making the speech to gain political favor.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to ascribe motives to the prime minister,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she told Mr. Rose. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The point is, we want the relationship between the United States and Israel to be unquestionably strong, immutable, regardless of political seasons in either country, regardless of which party may be in charge in either country.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve worked very hard to have that,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and we will work very hard to maintain that.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) set forth a foreign policy vision Wednesday that invoked President John F. Kennedy in an assertive call to project American power abroad.\n In comments delivered at the Council on Foreign Relations, the conservative senator vying for the GOP presidential nomination said the world would be safer if the U.S. military had a bigger budget and America asserted itself more aggressively across the globe.\n While the threats facing the United States have changed in the 21st century, America's global influence remains a benevolent force, Rubio said.\n \"President Kennedy, like most presidents before and since, understood what I believe our current president does not: that American strength is a means of preventing war, not promoting it,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Rubio said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And that weakness, on the other hand, is the friend of danger and the enemy of peace.\"\n \"Sadly, I believe President Obama often disagrees with that simple truth,\" Rubio added. \"He entered office believing America was too hard on our adversaries, too engaged in too many places, and that if we just took a step back and did some more 'nation building at home' -- ceding leadership to other countries -- America would be better liked and the world better off.\"\n In laying out what his campaign calls the \"Rubio Doctrine,\" the presidential hopeful said he was guided by three principles: \"American strength,\" \"the protection of the American economy in a globalized world\" and \"moral clarity regarding America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core values.\"\n From his seat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Rubio has already played a key role in U.S. foreign policy debates, often staking out positions that directly counter President Barack Obama's administration.\n The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has challenged Obama's efforts to normalize diplomatic relations with the island, saying that closer ties would only help the communist Castro government keep power. Rubio has also opposed the Obama administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, pressed for more support of rebels in Syria and advocated to increase aid to the government of Ukraine to counter Russia's influence in the east of the country.\n In Wednesday's speech the senator also took a swipe at Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, calling her tenure as secretary of state \"ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst.\"\n Journalist Charlie Rose asked Rubio after the speech whether invoking Kennedy and the Cold War might make him appear backward-looking at a time that Rubio's campaign portrays other U.S. leaders as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trapped in the past.\" Rubio responded that the Kennedy statements represented \"timeless\" truths.\n Rubio also told Rose he would not have authorized the 2003 invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam Hussein's regine if he knew Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not only would I have not been in favor of it, but President [George W.] Bush wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been in favor of it,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Rubio said.\n Bush\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brother Jeb, who has all but formally announced his bid for the Republican presidential nomination, raised eyebrows Monday after telling Fox News he supported the invasion even now that he knows Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction. Jeb Bush later said he had misunderstood the question.\n",

The visit, though, has further challenged the strained relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu.\n \"It's destructive to the fabric of the relationship,\" Rice said Tuesday on PBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Charlie Rose\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d show. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always been bipartisan.

To date, administration officials had maintained a more low-key stance, voicing concerns about the visit while saying Obama would not meet with his Israeli counterpart strictly out of a desire not to influence Israel's tight elections.\n But tensions are rising on all sides.\n Rice's comments came as Netanyahu turned down an invitation to meet privately with leading Senate Democrats during his trip to Washington, saying such a session could \"compound the misperception of partisanship\" surrounding his visit.\n Netanyahu told Sens. Dick Durbin, of Illinois, and Dianne Feinstein, of California, that he regrets the invitation has been perceived by some to be political or partisan.\n \"I can assure you that my sole intention in accepting it was to voice Israel's grave concerns about a potential nuclear agreement with Iran that could threaten the survival of my country,\" he told the senators in a letter.\n U.S. officials suggest Netanyahu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trip is aimed primarily at derailing a nuclear deal with Iran, a signature Obama foreign policy objective.\n While Netanyahu has long been skeptical of the negotiations, his opposition has increased over what he sees as Obama's willingness to make concessions that would leave Iran on the brink of being able to build a nuclear weapon. U.S. and Iranian officials reported progress in negotiations this week on a deal that would clamp down on Tehran's nuclear activities for at least 10 years but then slowly ease restrictions. Israeli officials warned this week that such a deal would allow Iran to become a nuclear threshold state.\n Vice President Biden won't attend the Netanyahu speech. And more than a half-dozen House and Senate Democrats also have said they will skip the event, calling it an affront to Obama and the administration as they negotiate with Iran over its nuclear program.\n But Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absence \u00e2\u20ac\u0153appalling and unacceptable.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \"I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where Joe Biden will be or what he will be doing, but I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more important than being in the chamber and listening to our best ally in the region -- Israel -- about the biggest threat to mankind, a nuclear-armed Iran. ... It shows complete disrespect, it shows they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re more worried about the politics in Israel than receiving information about a common threat,\" Graham, R-S.C., said Tuesday night on Fox News' \"On the Record with Greta Van Susteren.\"\n Durbin said he regretted that Netanyahu could not meet with the Democrats.\n \"We offered the prime minister an opportunity to balance the politically divisive invitation from Speaker Boehner.\" Durbin said. \"His refusal to meet is disappointing to those of us who have stood by Israel for decades.\"\n",

Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday urged state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill sent to his desk a day earlier, in the face of criticism that it could allow businesses and others to discriminate based on sexual orientation.\n Hutchinson had initially said he planned to sign the bill but backed off as his state, overnight, became the new focal point of a nationwide backlash over such legislation. Indiana for days has faced similar criticism for a related religious freedom bill.\n During a press conference in the state capital of Little Rock, Hutchinson said he wants to strike the \"right balance.\" The governor, amid calls by critics to veto the bill, made clear he still supports the intent of the legislation -- which prohibits state and local governments from infringing upon someone's religious beliefs without a compelling interest. But he said he wants changes made so it more closely mirrors a 1993 federal law.\n \"I asked that changes be made in the legislation,\" Hutchinson said, urging state lawmakers to \"recall\" the bill -- or pass additional legislation -- to \"remedy\" the issue.\n The announcement reflects the intense debate in state capitals across the country where such legislation is being considered. Backers say the intent was to simply replicate the 1993 federal law and similar laws in place in 19 other states. But when Indiana passed a slightly more expansive version which critics said could allow discrimination by businesses, Indiana lawmakers and Gov. Mike Pence later vowed to \"clarify\" the language in response to complaints.\n Hutchinson, too, said the country is clearly split on how to balance religious traditions with non-discrimination.\n At its heart, he said, \"this bill is not really complicated.\" But he cited a \"generational gap.\" As evidence, the governor said even his own son had signed a petition urging him to veto the bill.\n Hutchinson's chief complaint was that some provisions do not \"precisely mirror\" the federal law, and he wants that addressed. He said he's also working on an executive order to address the issue of tolerance.\n Echoing the reaction to Indiana's law, Hutchinson has faced pressure from the state's top employers, including retail giant Wal-Mart, which complained that the measure was discriminatory and would stifle economic development. Little Rock's mayor, the city's Chamber of Commerce and Arkansas-based data services company Acxiom all urged the governor to reject the measure in recent days.\n The Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights group, has run ads in Silicon Valley targeting technology firms Hutchinson hopes to attract to the state.\n Prior to the passage Tuesday of the Arkansas bill, the White House repeated its opposition to the Indiana law.\n \"This kind of public outcry ... is indicative of how this piece of legislation flies in the face of values that people all across America strongly support,\" said White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. \"Governor Pence falsely tried to suggest the law is the same as the 1993 law. That is not true.\"\n Earnest also said the Indiana law was a \"significant expansion\" of current law.\n",

Mike Huckabee announced Tuesday he is running for president, delivering an economy- and security-centered message that he hopes will appeal to everyday Americans and distinguish him from the already-crowded Republican field.\n Huckabee, who is embarking on his second presidential run, made the announcement in his hometown of Hope, Ark. In a 30-minute speech that focused on his humble beginnings, Huckabee vowed to end \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stagnant wages,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d protect Medicare and defeat radical Islamic terrorism.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Folks cannot seem to get ahead or even stay even,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n Huckabee, a former Baptist minister, ran for president in 2008, winning eight states including the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses before running out of money and exiting the race.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Folks, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a long way from a little brick rented house on Second Street in Hope, Arkansas, to the White House,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \"But here in this small town called Hope, I was raised to believe where a person started didn't mean that is where he had to stop. I always believed that kid could go from hope to higher ground.\"\n The 59-year-old Huckabee has a strong following among the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evangelical Christian base but this time will face stiff competition for that vote from such primary candidates as Dr. Ben Carson and Sen. Ted Cruz, of Texas.\n He frequently repeated the phrase, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hope to higher ground,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d which appears to be a slogan of sorts for his 2016 campaign.\n He also took a swipe at President Obama for declining to recognize the Islamic State group as radical Islamic terrorists and vowed to stop them.\n \"I wonder if he can watch a Western from the '50s and be able to figure out who the good guy and the bad guys really are,\" Huckabee said. \"As president, I promise you, we will no longer try to contain Jihadism. We will conquer it.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He also vowed to protect Medicare and give states more of a say in government and education.\n Huckabee, who left his job as a Fox News host earlier this year in preparation for a potential 2016 run, was Arkansas governor from 1996 to 2007, serving after Bill Clinton, who also is from Hope. And he was the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lieutenant governor from 1993 to 1996.\n Even before the speech, Huckabee was trying to position himself as the GOP candidate best equipped to defeat Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner.\n In a recent campaign video, Huckabee argued that in his more than 10 years as governor, he took on Democrats in \"Bill Clinton's Arkansas\" after then-candidate Bill Clinton won election to the White House in 1992.\n \"Every day in my life in politics was a fight,\" Huckabee says in the video, released as a preview of his Tuesday announcement. \"But any drunken redneck can walk into a bar and start a fight. A leader only starts a fight he's prepared to finish.\"\n The field of confirmed and potential GOP presidential candidates includes more than a dozen people.\n A new NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll of GOP primary voters shows 23 percent picked former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush as their first choice.\n Bush is followed in the poll by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio with 18 percent, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker with 14 percent, Cruz and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul with 11 percent, Carson with 7 percent, Huckabee and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at 5 percent, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry at 2 percent and former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina at 1 percent.\n Huckabee is the third Republican this week to announce a 2016 White House bid, following Fiorina and Carson, a retired neurosurgeon They join Cruz, Paul and Rubio.\n Campaign aides say Huckabee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s path to winning the party nomination this time will be to appeal to working-class cultural conservatives, pitching their candidate as an economic populist and foreign affairs hawk who holds deeply conservative views on social issues such as abortion and gay marriage.\n Huckabee advocates a national consumption tax, which is similar to a sales tax, to replace the existing federal taxes on personal income and payrolls. He rejects calls for a minimum wage hike, saying his proposals will yield a \"maximum wage\" for workers.\n On immigration, he insists on a secure border and bemoans the presence of millions of people who are living in the country illegally, though he favors a creating a path to citizenship for children of immigrant parents who brought them to the U.S. illegally.\n Like other Republican White House hopefuls, Huckabee is sharply critical of Obama's foreign policy. He has called for \"bombing the daylights\" out of Islamic State targets in the Middle East, though he says American troops should be deployed to the region only as part of an international coalition that includes nations such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan.\n But whatever the issue, Huckabee, also an author, wraps his appeal as a pitch to everyday Americans who he says \"don't feel like anybody understands or knows who they are, much less cares what's happening to them.\"\n Evangelical Christian voters helped Huckabee win the Iowa caucuses in 2008 and finish a strong second in South Carolina, the largest of the early-voting states.\n He would need to replicate that early success to create an opening to build a wider coalition and compete deep into the primary schedule.\n",

We want it that way. I think Israel wants it that way. The American people want it that way. When it becomes injected or infused with politics, that's a problem.\"\n Obama has said he will not meet with Netanyahu ahead of his speech in March, saying it would be \"inappropriate\" to meet with the leader two weeks before the Israeli elections. Netanyahu was invited to speak in front of a joint session of Congress by House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), who did not seek approval from the White House before sending the invitation.\n Several lawmakers have spoken out against the speech, saying it could cause additional strain on international talks over Iran's nuclear plans. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) called Netanyahu's speech \"a tawdry and high-handed stunt\" in a statement earlier this month.\n",

Asa Hutchinson (R) signed a revised version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act on Thursday, one day after refusing to sign an earlier version of the bill over concerns about discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals.\n Earlier Thursday, the Republican-controlled state legislature passed a new version of the bill at the governor's request, amending provisions that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers. The amended legislation mirrors the federal RFRA.\n Meanwhile, legislators in Indiana have made changes to the controversial RFRA signed into law by Gov. Mike Pence (R) last week. On Thursday, the state's general assembly passed new language explicitly stating that the law does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The changes came amid immense national backlash, with dozens of politicians, business leaders and celebrities speaking out against the bill.\n In a Wednesday press conference announcing his opposition to the initial version of the bill, Hutchinson said his son had asked him to veto the legislation.\n \"My son Seth signed the petition asking me, Dad, the governor, to veto this bill,\" he said. \"And he gave me permission to make that reference, and it shows that families -- and there's a generational difference of opinion on these issues.\"\n Hutchinson also faced pressure from Walmart, which is headquartered in the state.

I want to invite all those organizations, and anyone interested in a state that promotes equality and opportunity, to come visit Washington. We are open for business, and open to all people.\"\n Earlier Monday, Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy (D) took a similar stand against the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed into law by Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) at a private ceremony last week. The measure has sparked national backlash, with critics warning that the law provides legal justification for discrimination against LGBT individuals.\n In addition to Connecticut and Washington, San Francisco and Seattle have also imposed bans on city-funded travel to the state. The mayors of Minnesota's Twin Cities, Minneapolis and St. Paul, have also condemned the measure.\n The cities and states are joined by a number of business leaders speaking out against the law. Apple chief Tim Cook called the law \"dangerous\" in a Washington Post op-ed, while Salesforce's Marc Benioff canceled the company's planned events in the state. And on Monday, the executives of nine Indiana-based companies, including Angie's List and Anthem, sent a letter to Pence outlining their concerns.\n \"Regardless of the original intention of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, we are deeply concerned about the impact it is having on our employees and on the reputation of our state,\" reads the letter.\n Pence has defended his decision to sign the bill, claiming that the measure has been \"grossly misconstrued as a 'license to discriminate.'\"\n \"I abhor discrimination. I believe in the Golden Rule that you should 'do unto others as you would have them do unto you,'\" Pence wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. \"If I saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat there anymore. As governor of Indiana, if I were presented a bill that legalized discrimination against any person or group, I would veto it. Indiana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new law contains no reference to sexual orientation. It simply mirrors federal law that President Bill Clinton signed in 1993.\"\n However, the governor and legislative leaders say they will seek to clarify that the law does not protect discrimination.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is not the intent of the law to discriminate against anyone, and it will not be allowed to discriminate against anyone,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d state Senate President Pro Tem David Long (R) said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We hope to have a fix very soon.\"\n",

Marco Rubio said if elected, he would prioritize a strong military, take aggressive steps to fight nations that undermine global commerce and ensure that U.S. is a world moral leader.\n The Florida Republican, who delivered his speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in Manhattan on Wednesday, said that the United States was losing its place as a world military and moral power because of what he depicted as the Obama administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overly cautious responses to crises overseas.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since the end of the Cold War, the threats facing America have changed, but the need for American strength has not,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Rubio said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has only grown more pressing as the world has grown more interconnected.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It takes forethought to design and many years to build the capabilities we may need at a moment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s notice,\" the 43-year-old said. \"So to restore American strength, my first priority will be to adequately fund our military. This would be a priority even in times of peace and stability, though the world today is neither peaceful nor stable.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Rubio repeated his characterization of Obama as a president so concerned with softening any perception other nations has of the United States as a bully that he erred in acting in the other extreme, eager to acquiesce to foreign governments that have thumbed their noses at the U.S. and international laws.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[Obama] demonstrated a disregard for our moral purpose that at times flirted with disdain,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He criticized America for having \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcarrogance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and the audacity to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdictate our terms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to other nations. From his reset with Russia, to his open hand to Iran, to his unreciprocated opening to Cuba, he has embraced regimes that systematically oppose every principle our nation has long championed.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Rubio also said that the United States must move decisively when aggressive nations such as China and Iran attempt to undermine the economic interests of the United States as well as other nations.\n \"Russia, China, Iran or any other nation that attempts to block global commerce will know to expect a response from my administration.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The Democratic National Committee issued a brief statement shortly after Rubio's speech:\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Okay. So here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rubio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnew\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 foreign policy. Troops in the Middle East permanently. A Cuba policy that is stuck in the Cold War. Unwillingness to even start a discussion of a two state solution. Keeping Guantanamo Bay open. No plan forward on Iran.\"\n And it ended with: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Neoconservative meets Cold War: that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Rubio doctrine.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Rubio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign policy agenda \u00e2\u20ac\u201c often hawkish in approach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has been a hallmark of his service in the Senate, and now in his campaign. He says that as a member of Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the Senate Committee on Intelligence, he is privy to information that form the basis of his decision on how the United States must approach foreign policy.\n Rubio said Obama \"wasted no time stripping parts from the engine of American strength,\" and cast former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as his loyal deputy.\n \"[Clinton] was the chief architect of a foreign policy that was a disaster,\" he said during an interview with Charlie Rose following the speech.\n \"We simply cannot afford to elect as our next president one of the leading agents of this administration's foreign policy \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a leader from yesterday whose tenure as secretary of state was ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst,\" Rubio said, according to the prepared text of remarks he was to deliver at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.\n He even has taken tougher stances on foreign policy than some of his Republican colleagues, who have softened their views on diplomatic relations with Cuba \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to which Rubio objects \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and how to handle the nuclear talks with Iran.\n Some in the GOP have called for spending cuts in military spending, with which he disagrees.\n As he often has in Senate hearings, Rubio assailed Obama for stressing dialogues and diplomacy over ironclad dealings with heads of foreign governments that have been openly hostile to the United States, and which continue to exercise oppression against political dissidents.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The world is at its safest when America is at its strongest,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Rubio said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When America has the mightiest Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and intelligence community in the world, the result is more peace, not more conflict.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Rubio said, after his speech, in a question-and-answer session with TV host Charlie Rose, that \"Obama has embraced regimes that systematically opposed our principles.\"\n Rose asked Rubio what he though of Pope Francis's embrace of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba.\n Rubio said his priorities and those of the pope's are by necessity different.\n He defended keeping the embargo.\n He said having anything to do with Cuba is to avail oneself of properties stolen from Cubans by the Cuban government during the revolution.\n Rubio said the embargo is not to blame for Cuba's failed economy.\n He said the rest of the world does not have an embargo against Cuba. So why, he asked, does Cuba not have Toyotas or modern goods from other nations?\n As for Iran, Rubio said it cannot be trusted.\n \"Iran has always had a secret component to its nuclear program,\" he said. \"They know once international sanctions are lifted, they can never be reimposed.\"\n",

She declined to take sides on the Friday vote itself but instead allied herself with Democratic critics of the deal \u00e2\u20ac\u201d without actually opposing it.\n She argued that the House vote gave Mr. Obama \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this amazing opportunity\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d to seek concessions from Pacific trading partners to salvage the deal.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The president should listen to and work with his allies in Congress, starting with Nancy Pelosi, who have expressed their concerns about the impact that a weak agreement would have on our workers to make sure we get the best, strongest deal possible,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mrs. Clinton said at a rally here.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And if we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it, there should be no deal,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she added.\n Mrs. Clinton indicated that if she were president, she would not abandon the 12-nation Pacific trade deal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as some Democrats want \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but would use the opposition in Congress as negotiating leverage.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am willing to try now to see whether you can push to get rid of the objectionable parts, to drive a harder bargain on some of the other parts,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mrs. Clinton said at the rally, her first here as a candidate for the 2016 presidential nomination.\n Mrs. Clinton has been criticized by Republicans and some Democrats for saying little about the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal in recent weeks, especially since she had made favorable comments about it as secretary of state. She is facing many Democratic primary voters who have deep misgivings about trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, that President Bill Clinton signed, and she faces rivals for the 2016 nomination like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont who flatly oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n A few hours before Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks, Mr. Sanders repeated his challenge to her to oppose the trade agreement.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would hope that the secretary joins Elizabeth Warren, Sherrod Brown and the vast majority of Democrats in the Congress in saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNo, we have got to defeat this piece of legislation,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Sanders said on CBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Face the Nation,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d referring to fellow senators.\n Without naming names, Mrs. Clinton sought to distinguish herself from Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, as well as from fervent supporters of the deal like some of the Republicans running for president.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No president would be a tougher negotiator on behalf of American workers with either our trading partners or Republicans on Capitol Hill than I would be,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mrs. Clinton said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are the voices that are for the deal no matter what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in it, and there are voices that are against the deal no matter what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in it. I kind of fall in the group that says, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s find out what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in it, and let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s make it as good as it can be before we make the decision.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mrs. Clinton invoked Ms. Pelosi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name twice during her remarks and appeared to agree with Ms. Pelosi that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there are some specifics in there that could and should be changed.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d She said she supported trade adjustment authority to protect American jobs, but otherwise did not delve into details.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take the lemons and turn it into lemonade,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she said.\n Later on Sunday, at a house party with Democrats in Burlington, Iowa, Mrs. Clinton was more explicit in challenging Mr. Obama by setting expectations for him to work with congressional Democrats on the trade deal. Mrs. Clinton called Ms. Pelosi \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as strong a supporter\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d as Mr. Obama has, and said she hoped Mr. Obama would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seize\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the chance to work with Democrats to improve the trade pact.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My view is the White House should call Nancy and a few other of the Democrats to say, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhat would it take to get an agreement that would be better and not worse for American workers?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mrs. Clinton said, aligning herself with a potential future ally (Ms. Pelosi) over a lame-duck president.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have held my peace because I thought it was important for the Congress to have a full debate without thrusting presidential politics and candidates into it,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mrs. Clinton added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But now I think the president and his team could have a chance to drive a harder bargain, because they are now in the position of saying to all of these other countries \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwe need to maximize the number of winners.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Chris Christie declared an uphill candidacy for president on Tuesday with New Jersey-style swagger, unconcealed disgust for Washington and a high regard for his own candor, vowing that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there is one thing you will know for sure: I say what I mean and I mean what I say.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Relying on his biggest, and perhaps his last, remaining advantage in a field of better-financed and better-liked rivals \u00e2\u20ac\u201d his personality \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Mr. Christie portrayed himself as the only candidate in the Republican field who is forthright and forceful enough to run the country.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need strength and decision-making and authority back in the Oval Office,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n Pacing the stage without a prepared text and raising his voice to a shout at times, he vowed to campaign and govern as a colorful teller of difficult truths, even if \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it makes you cringe every once in a while.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am not running for president of the United States as surrogate for being elected prom king of America,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Christie said inside the gymnasium at the high school where he was president of his class all three years.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am not going to be the most popular guy who looks into your eye every day and says what you want to hear,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he continued.\n Trying to claw his way back to the top of the Republican field, Mr. Christie took a pointed swipe at his rivals who are in the United States Senate, like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, who have never run a state government.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unlike some people who offer themselves for president in 2016, you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wonder whether I can do it or not,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said, invoking the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic calamity\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said he inherited in 2010 and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unprecedented natural disaster,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Hurricane Sandy, that he weathered as governor.\n But he reserved his deepest disdain for Congress and for the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stewardship of foreign affairs, and extended that critique to President Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former secretary of state.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After seven years of a weak and feckless foreign policy run by Barack Obama, we better not turn it over to his second mate, Hillary Clinton,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Christie said.\n Still, he blamed both parties for dysfunction and gridlock in Washington. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If Washington and Adams and Jefferson believed that compromise was a dirty word, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d still be under the crown of England,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n Mr. Christie, whose dazzling rise as a national Republican in his first term was matched only by his spectacular loss of stature at home in his second, entered the presidential race bearing little resemblance to the candidate he once expected to be.\n The economic recovery he promised has turned into a cascade of ugly credit downgrades and anemic job growth. The state pension system he vowed to fix has descended into a morass of missed payments and lawsuits. The administration he pledged would be a paragon of ethics has instead conspired to mire an entire town in traffic and the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office in scandal.\n Three and a half years ago, Mr. Christie seemed such an antidote to all that ailed the Republican brand that senior figures in the party pleaded with him to run for president as a substitute for the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney.\n But now, a staggering 55 percent of Republican primary voters say that they cannot envision voting for Mr. Christie, according to an NBC-Wall Street Journal Poll. The only candidate less palatable: Donald J. Trump, the bombastic developer turned reality television star.\n With two pillars of his presidential run \u00e2\u20ac\u201d his record and his judgment \u00e2\u20ac\u201d looking wobbly, Mr. Christie must now build a campaign around his most raw and prodigious asset: his personality, a magnetic mix of quick-witted charm, insult-trading banter, vulnerability, empathy and effrontery.\n It was on vivid display Tuesday before hundreds of supporters, including many of Mr. Christie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest friends and most loyal aides. He joked about the need for a new and refined tax code that would finally put his father, a certified public account standing nearby, out of business. He described the decision to enter politics as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coin toss\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d between him and his wife, Mary Pat, herself a nimble political mind. And he put an unusual twist on the dilemma facing the financially stretched Social Security system.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The lying and stealing has already happened, the horse is out of the barn, we need to get it back in, and the only way to do it is by force,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n Mr. Christie, 52, honed his political technique, and developed a YouTube following, during a remarkable run of 137 town-hall-style meetings across New Jersey. Not surprisingly, he plans to put the town hall meeting at the center of his candidacy \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and to put his hopes in a state, New Hampshire, that is famed for its own town hall meetings. He is forgoing the customary tour of early-voting states that usually follows a formal announcement, aides said. Instead, Mr. Christie will plant himself in New Hampshire for a week, holding one town hall after another.\n Such single-mindedness belies the serious and stubborn vulnerabilities of his campaign.\n As a centrist candidate from the Northeast, he would have a difficult path to the Republican presidential nomination under the best circumstances. And circumstances are anything but optimal for him: He faces a wide field of candidates, including several who are better financed and beloved by mainstream donors (Jeb Bush), hold greater appeal to conservative voters who dominate the primary process (Scott Walker), are agile public speakers with persuasive biographies (Mr. Rubio), or are better liked by Republican voters (all of the above).\n At his announcement, Mr. Christie sought political rebirth, as he has before, by relying on his powers as a narrator, and mythologizer, of his own story.\n Running for president is a new and bigger stage, though, and both Mr. Christie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stagecraft and his oratory showed room for improvement. The first speaker who preceded him to the stage had no microphone, causing a delay; later on, she was booed when she disclosed that she was a Democrat.\n Without a text, Mr. Christie frequently descended into clich\u00c3\u00a9s. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The truth will set us free,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said at one point. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One person can make a difference,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said at another.\n But he also spoke with emotional power, as when he recalled his father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early job in an ice cream factory in Newark.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Think about how amazing this country is,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Christie said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That one generation removed from that guy who was working on the floor of the Breyers ice cream plant, his son is the two-term governor of the state that he was born and raised in.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The question for Mr. Christie, after a bruising year of watching his story rewritten by others, may be whether Republican voters, who can choose from among a long and intriguing list of fresher faces, will give him a fighting chance to sell himself anew.\n",

Chris Christie (R) announced he's running for president in 2016.\n Christie told supporters of his plans in a phone call Tuesday morning, according to NBC and the AP.\n Christie made a public announcement Tuesday afternoon at Livingston High School, his alma mater, in Livingston, New Jersey.\n \"I am now ready to fight for the people of the United States of America,\" Christie said at the public announcement.\n He praised his home state during his speech, sharing how working as governor inspired him to run for president. Christie also took hits at lawmakers in Washington, including President Barack Obama, claiming a lack of productivity from Congress is giving Americans anxiety.\n \"Both parties have failed our country... both parties have led us to believe that America, a country that was built on compromise -- that compromise is somehow a dirty word,\" Christie said.\n \"We need to have the courage to choose, we need to have the courage to stand up and say 'enough,'\" Christie added.\n Christie, a tough-talking former federal prosecutor whose reputation for political bullying was reinforced by a George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal last year, has served as New Jersey governor since January 2010, winning election twice in a state where Democrats greatly outnumber Republicans.\n He notably led the state during catastrophic damage from Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Christie's favorability rating among voters skyrocketed after he made himself visible through interviews, press conferences and tours of storm damage during the disaster.\n Christie focused on his state rather than the presidential election that took place days after New Jersey's shore was ravaged by the storm. HuffPost reported in November 2012 Christie turned down an invitation to appear at an event with Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney days ahead of the election. Instead, Christie was seen that October praising President Barack Obama for responsiveness and \"leadership\" in the storm's aftermath.\n In an October 2012 interview with Fox News, Christie said he didn't \"give a damn about presidential politics\" in the wake of the storm.\n \"I have got a job to do here in New Jersey that is much bigger than presidential politics. And I could care less about any of that stuff,\" Christie said.\n Christie was elected chairman of the Republican Governors Association in November 2013. He worked within that role to raise money and contribute to the campaigns of Republican governors across the U.S., many of whom won in the 2014 midterm elections.\n While serving as chair of the governors association, Christie held prep sessions on foreign policy with officials, business leaders and academics in an attempt to ready himself for a White House run, according The Associated Press.\n Known for his blunt speaking style, Christie has acknowledged that he can come off brash and confrontational.\n \"I'm not everybody's cup of tea, but I'm not in this business to get elected to prom king. My job is to lead, and that's what I try to do,\" Christie said in 2014, according to the AP.\n His image suffered a major blow in 2014, when it was revealed members of his administration, including his deputy chief of staff, were involved in a plot to cause traffic jams near the George Washington Bridge to retaliate against a mayor who hadn't supported Christie's 2013 re-election. Dubbed \"Bridgegate,\" the controversy caused Christie, who had enjoyed high favorability ratings, to see his negatives rise sharply.\n Christie has also faced criticism for reversinghis position recently on Common Core education standards. Christie initially supported the standards but said recently that he no longer supports them because of how they've played out in his state.\n According to HuffPost Pollster, Christie is in the middle of the pack of GOP presidential candidates.\n",

The department said late Monday that it had received 55,000 pages of Clinton's emails as part of a request made to previous secretaries of state to turn over any official documents they may have had in their possession.\n It is not clear how many total emails from that period were in Clinton's personal account, nor is it clear how Clinton's advisers decided which emails to hand over to the State Department.\n Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, said the former secretary of state expected that emails to State Department officials -- which she sent to department accounts -- would be preserved. \"When the Department asked former Secretaries last year for help ensuring their emails were in fact retained, we immediately said yes,\" he said. \"Both the letter and spirit of the rules permitted State Department officials to use non-government email, as long as appropriate records were preserved.\"\n The fate of emails to foreign leaders, private citizens, and non-State Department officials is unclear.\n \"The State Department has long had access to a wide array of Secretary Clinton's records -- including emails between her and Department officials with state.gov accounts,\" State Department Deputy Spokesperson Marie Harf told Fox News late Monday. Harf added that the department turned over about 300 emails to the Benghazi select committee, and noted that Clinton's successor as secretary of state, John Kerry, \"is the first ... to rely primarily on a state.gov email account.\"\n According to the Times, however, while past secretaries of state often used personal email, updated regulations required such emails to be preserved.\n Clinton and her aides reportedly did not follow that requirement at the time -- until her office turned over documents.\n Republicans seized on the developments on Tuesday. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., former chairman of the House oversight committee, said in a statement that Clinton \"failed\" to follow records law.\n \"The use of a personal e-mail address to skirt public records laws, aside from failing to meet the security standards one would expect of the nation's top diplomat, enabled Clinton to shield her official communications from scrutiny by the media and the American public,\" he said.\n White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was peppered with questions at Tuesday's briefing.\n He said the administration policy is that employees \"should use their official email accounts when they're conducting official government business.\" He said personal emails also should be preserved and said Clinton's team responded to the request by the department seeking them.\n Earnest would not say whether the White House believes Clinton broke the law.\n Records officials interviewed by The Times expressed grave concern over Clinton's practice, saying it represents a severe ethical breach and noting that personal email accounts are far less secure than official ones.\n Jason Baron, a former director of litigation at the National Archives, told the paper he found it \"very difficult to conceive of a scenario \u00e2\u20ac\u201d short of nuclear winter \u00e2\u20ac\u201d where an agency would be justified in allowing its cabinet-level head officer to solely use a private email communications channel for the conduct of government business.\" Baron added that the use of private e-mail accounts is meant to be reserved only for emergencies, such as when a department's server is not working or compromised.\n However, The Times reports that the imposition of penalties for not complying with federal record-keeping requirements are rare because the National Archives has so few enforcement mechanisms.\n The report has drawn heavy criticism from Republicans, including at least one potential challenger in the 2016 presidential race. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who released 250,000 emails from his gubernatorial tenure this past December, tweeted about the contrast between his disclosures and Clinton's secrecy.\n Clinton is widely believed to be the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in 2016. The Wall Street Journal reported late Sunday that she was expected to formally launch her candidacy next month.\n",

They also donated $15 million to charity, and paid an additional $13.6 million in state taxes.\n The Clintons' effective federal tax rate for 2014 was 35.7 percent, while the effective tax rate for federal, state and local taxes was 45.8 percent.\n Meanwhile, the statement on her health, from Dr. Lisa Bardack, an internist and chairman of the Department of Medicine at the Mount Kisco Medical Group in Mount Kisco, New York, said the former secretary of state has seasonal pollen allergies and listed \"deep vein thrombosis,\" an elbow fracture and her 2012 concussion in her recent medical history. Following the concussion, a subsequent blood clot developed in her brain.\n As a result, Clinton experienced double vision and wore glasses with a Fresnel prism for two months. During Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s follow-up evaluations, she was found to have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transverse sinus venous thrombosis\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and started \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anticoagulation therapy\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d to dissolve the clot.\n In 2013, she tested \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negative\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d for all clotting disorders, though continues a daily anticoagulation as a precaution, Bardack said.\n Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current medications also include Armour Thyroid, which is used to treat underactive thyroids, antihistamines and Vitamin B12.\n She doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t smoke, drinks occasionally and eats a diet rich in protein. She also exercises regularly, practices yoga, swims, walks and weight trains, her doctor said.\n At her most recent physical on March 21, her blood pressure was 100/65 and her heart rate was 72. Her cholesterol came back at 195, with an LDL of 118, HDL of 64 and triglycerides of 69.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153(Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) cancer screening evaluations are all negative,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Bardack added.. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She is in excellent physical condition and fit to serve as president of the United States.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s camp is touting the fact she is the first 2016 candidate to release any kind of health information, though she only officially released a one-and-a-half-page letter from her doctor.\n Both these releases come as the State Department releases thousands of pages of emails from her time running the department. It was the third major release of Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s email records.\n The State Department has made available several hundred pages of documents in prior releases related to the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and other issues.\n",

Obama spent the weekend lobbying members of his party to switch their votes next week.\n At a rally in Iowa, Clinton said that if the president can't come to terms with Pelosi, there should be no deal. \"Here's what I think should happen now,\" Clinton said. \"The president should listen to and work with his allies in Congress, starting with Nancy Pelosi, who have expressed their concerns about the impact that a weak agreement would have on our workers, to make sure we get the best, strongest deal possible and if we don't get it, there should be no deal.\"\n Clinton said she wants to \"find out what's in it and make it as good as it can be,\" and pushed for more transparency \"so the American people can actually see what will be in a finalized deal.\"\n House Democrats rejected Obama's trade agenda Friday by blocking a measure that would have granted him the power to fast-track sweeping, secretive international agreements through Congress.\n Clinton refrained from mentioning trade in her official campaign kickoff speech that took place at New York City's Roosevelt Island on Saturday. Ahead of her remarks in Iowa on Sunday, her campaign said she would not be taking a position on trade until details of a deal were finalized.\n However, Clinton appeared to suggest she would seek to negotiate the trade agreement as president.\n \"No president would be a tougher negotiator on behalf of American workers, either with our trading partners or Republicans on Capitol Hill, than I would be,\" she said.\n",

He also criticized the Supreme Court for potentially overturning bans on same-sex marriage. He also said that he favored term limits for individuals in all branches of the federal government -- including the judiciary.\n \"The Supreme Court is not the supreme being,\" he said.\n Huckabee, 59, quit his job hosting his own Fox News show, \"Huckabee,\" in January. Last month, he began plotting campaign strategy and hiring staff.\n Huckabee ran for president in 2008. He joins an already crowded 2016 Republican field, and will likely enlist support from the party's far right wing, where he faces competition from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who has positioned himself as a tea party favorite. Huckabee said on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" last month that he's confident he can broaden his appeal beyond evangelical Christians and social conservatives to reach working-class Republicans concerned about the economy.\n \"There's a real sense in the Republican Party that there's no one speaking, not only to them, but speaking for them,\" Huckabee said then. \"And if someone can capture both the blue-collar, working-class Republicans, the conservatives, many of them even union members, as well as evangelicals, there's a real pathway to the nomination.\"\n Huckabee, an ordained Southern Baptist minister, is a celebrated figure among evangelical Christians. He was the longest-serving Arkansas governor, from 1996 to 2007. He made national headlines for losing more than 110 pounds from 2003 to 2006, and he publicly addressed his struggles with weight. His book, \"Quit Digging Your Grave with a Knife and Fork,\" became a bestseller and he made obesity a major policy initiative as governor.\n He ran for the GOP presidential nomination in 2008, capturing strong support from evangelical Christians and winning the Iowa caucuses. But Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), won most of the subsequent primaries, and Huckabee withdrew from the race that March. His supporters expected him to run again in 2012, but he declined. Since then, he has continued to influence the conservative movement as a charismatic public speaker and radio and television host.\n Huckabee's religion has played a prominent role in his political career and shaped him as a staunch social conservative. He wrote in his memoir, \"From Hope to Higher Ground,\" that his work as a pastor helps him understand how politics and policy affect people.\n \"My experience dealing every day with real people who were genuinely affected by policies created by government gave me a deep understanding of the fragility of the human spirit and vulnerability of so many families who struggled from week to week,\" he wrote. \"I was in the ICU at 2 a.m. with families faced with the decision to disconnect a respirator on their loved one; I counseled fifteen-year-old pregnant girls who were afraid to tell their parents about their condition; I spent hours hearing the grief of women who had been physically and emotionally clobbered by an abusive husband.\"\n As governor, Huckabee signed a ban on gay marriage (which was overturned by a federal judge last year), and he has been outspoken in his opposition against states legalizing marriage equality. Last year, he argued that he's on \"the right side of the Bible.\"\n \"You've got to understand, this for me is not about the right side or the wrong side of history, this is the right side of the Bible, and unless God rewrites it, edits it, sends it down with his signature on it, it's not my book to change. Folks, that's why I stand where I stand,\" he said.\n According to HuffPost Pollster, Huckabee falls behind a few other GOP 2016 candidates, trailing Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.) and Ted Cruz (Texas), and Marco Rubio (Fla.), but slightly edging out former neurosurgeon Ben Carson.\n",

Mike Pence of Indiana, moving to address a growing political firestorm over a religious freedom law enacted last week, said over the weekend that he would seek legislation to clarify the intent of the law, and rejected assertions that it sanctioned discrimination against gays and lesbians.\n The governor, a Republican, told The Indianapolis Star on Saturday that he was taken aback by negative reactions to the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which he signed into law on Thursday. He told the newspaper that he expected legislation clarifying the law to be introduced in the General Assembly this week, but offered no details.\n The law aims to protect individuals or companies from being forced to take actions that impose a substantial burden on their religious beliefs. Proponents say the law should allow Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples without fear of legal reprisals.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I support religious liberty, and I support this law,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the governor said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we are in discussions with legislative leaders this weekend to see if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a way to clarify the intent of the law.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Pence appeared on ABC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This Week\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d on Sunday, and the host, George Stephanopoulos, asked him whether signing the law was a mistake.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Absolutely not,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Pence said, adding later: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I signed the bill. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to continue to explain it to people who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand it, and if possible, we will find a way to amplify what this bill really is in the legislative process.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But his answers to other questions were less clear. Mr. Pence did not directly answer whether the law might protect, for example, a Christian florist who denied service to a gay couple. Asserting that the legislation was not about discrimination, he said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The issue here is, you know, is tolerance a two-way street or not?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n On Saturday, thousands of protesters gathered at the Statehouse as businesses and other governments announced a halt to business with the state and the capital, Indianapolis, over the law.\n Marc Benioff, the chief executive officer of Salesforce.com, said on Thursday that his company would halt all corporate travel to Indiana. On Saturday, Mayor Ed Murray of Seattle announced a ban on city employees traveling to Indiana for work using city funds.\n The same day, Bill Oesterle, the chief executive officer of Angie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s List, said his company would abandon a deal with Indiana and Indianapolis to expand its headquarters. His opposition was seen as an indication of dissatisfaction with the law beyond the liberal political left; he was the campaign director for Mitch Daniels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successful Republican bid for governor in 2004.\n The debate cast a shadow over preparations in Indianapolis for the N.C.A.A. men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s basketball tournament, which will take place in Indianapolis on Saturday and next Monday. In a statement on Thursday, the N.C.A.A. president, Mark Emmert, said the organization was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply concerned\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d about the legislation.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We intend to closely examine the implications of this bill and how it might affect future events as well as our work force,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n The backlash has been an unexpected political headache for Mr. Pence, who is juggling whether to run for re-election or for president in 2016.\n Defending the law in the interviews with The Star and Mr. Stephanopoulos, the governor pointed to its origins in federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton and adopted by about 19 other states. Indiana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bill was drafted from a version that President Obama voted for when he was a state senator in Illinois, Mr. Pence said. Critics, however, say the Indiana law includes different wording that could open the door to wider discrimination.\n Critics also note that in many of the states with similar laws, including Illinois, sexual orientation is protected under civil rights law. In Indiana, gays and lesbians are not a protected class.\n When asked if he would seek those protections, the governor said that he would not. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not on my agenda,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This Week.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

But they noticed that among the 15,000 documents they examined, there were no emails to or from an official departmental account for Mrs. Clinton.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This all raised the question to us: What else are we missing, and what do we need to comply\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d with the request, said one official briefed on the matter.\n Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman and the State Department have cast her decision to hand over her emails as motivated by efforts to update the department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record management system. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When the department asked former secretaries last year for help ensuring their emails were in fact retained, we immediately said yes,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Nick Merrill, the Clinton spokesman, said on Sunday.\n But it was the review of Benghazi-related documents last summer that, within the State Department, set off the chain of events leading to the public disclosure this week of Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s use of a private email account, according to the current and former department officials.\n The decision to ask Mrs. Clinton for her emails went all the way to Secretary of State John Kerry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief of staff, who, along with officials working on the response to the Benghazi requests, signed off on it.\n Beginning in August, senior State Department officials held negotiations with Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyers and advisers to gain access to her personal email records. At one point, her advisers met face-to-face with department officials in Washington.\n In October, the State Department sent a letter to Mrs. Clinton and all former secretaries of state back to Madeleine K. Albright, seeking emails and other documents in their possession that related to their government work.\n Finally, in December, dozens of boxes filled with 50,000 pages of printed emails from Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal account were delivered to the State Department. Those documents were then examined by department lawyers, who found roughly 900 pages pertaining to the Benghazi attacks.\n Three weeks ago, the State Department handed over the Benghazi emails to the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which is led by Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina.\n Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman, Mr. Merrill, did not respond to an email seeking comment. A senior State Department official said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would be oversimplified and inaccurate to draw the conclusion that the preservation of her records was done for one purpose.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Late Wednesday night, two days after The New York Times first reported that she had exclusively used a personal email account as secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton announced that she had asked the State Department to release those communications.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I want the public to see my email,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mrs. Clinton wrote in a Twitter post shortly before midnight, addressing the issue publicly for the first time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision leaves it to the State Department to determine whether parts of her correspondence should be redacted if they contain information that could be damaging to national security, or for other reasons.\n That process could take several months, officials said, because different parts of the State Department must weigh in on whether information should be redacted. Other government agencies, like the C.I.A. and the Defense Department, may also need to be consulted on any information related to them.\n While the State Department has said there does not appear to be any classified material in Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emails, officials said on Thursday that they needed to go through the trove again to determine whether it contained any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sensitive\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d information.\n Sensitive information is different from classified information. It can be personal data, like Social Security numbers, or information on matters that other countries consider classified or important to their national security.\n One State Department official said that if many lawyers were dedicated to the project, it could be completed in several weeks.\n Since the disclosure that Mrs. Clinton used the private account, a spokeswoman for the State Department has described the request from Mrs. Clinton as part of the department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s larger efforts to improve its record-keeping. The spokeswoman, Marie Harf, was asked on Tuesday whether there was any connection between the requests from Congress and the decision to ask the former secretaries of state for emails from their personal accounts.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The letter actually went before we got the request from the select committee,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ms. Harf said of the request to the former secretaries. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It went in October of 2014 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that was before we had gotten a request from the committee \u00e2\u20ac\u201d as part of our records-maintenance upgrading and the process we go through.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Ms. Harf said that Mrs. Clinton was the only secretary of state who had sent back copies of emails.\n",

He added that Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disclosure last week that all of the emails from the personal account had been deleted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153only exacerbates our need to better understand what the secretary did, when she did it and why she did it.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The emails were on a server at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y. Mr. Gowdy had asked Mrs. Clinton to turn over that server to a neutral third party, like the State Department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inspector general, to determine which emails were personal and which were government records.\n But in a letter to Mr. Gowdy on Friday, a lawyer for Mrs. Clinton said there was no need to turn over the server because an examination of it showed that it had no copies of emails she sent during her time as secretary of state.\n In October, the State Department asked former secretaries of state dating back to Madeleine Albright to provide it with any government records \u00e2\u20ac\u201d like emails \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they might have in their possession. The lawyer for Mrs. Clinton, David Kendall, said that in response to that request, Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s representatives had determined which of her roughly 60,000 emails were personal and private. Then, he said, a setting on the email account was changed to retain only messages sent in the previous two months.\n Since the report by The New York Times on March 2 that Mrs. Clinton used only a personal email account and did not even have a government account, she seems to have provided two answers about whether she still has copies of her emails.\n At a news conference at the United Nations a little more than a week after The Times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report, Mrs. Clinton first said she \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chose not to keep\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d her private personal emails. But she then said that the server, which contained personal communications of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will remain private.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Gowdy said the committee believed that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a transcribed interview would best protect Secretary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s privacy, the security of the information queried and the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest in ensuring this committee has all information needed to accomplish the task set before it.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But Mrs. Clinton indicated on Tuesday that she wanted to give her testimony in a public setting. In a written statement, a spokesman for her said she had told the committee months ago that she was prepared to testify at a public hearing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is by their choice that hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happened,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said the spokesman, Nick Merrill. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To be clear, she remains ready to appear at a hearing open to the American public.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ranking member, Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, said the panel should hold a public hearing instead of a private interview. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rather than drag out this political charade into 2016 and selectively leak portions of a closed-door interview, the committee should schedule the public hearing, make her records public and refocus its efforts on the attacks in Benghazi,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n Mr. Gowdy has sought to prevent his inquiry into the attacks in 2012 on an American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and its burgeoning examination of Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s email practices \u00e2\u20ac\u201d from being dismissed as a strictly partisan effort to embarrass a likely Democratic nominee for president. But the time frame in which he is asking Mrs. Clinton to submit to questioning \u00e2\u20ac\u201d at any time before May 1 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d coincides with the period in which she is widely expected to make her candidacy official.\n Some Republicans on Capitol Hill \u00e2\u20ac\u201d including Mr. Gowdy \u00e2\u20ac\u201d are growing frustrated with Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, who they contend is politicizing the email issue. On Monday, Mr. Priebus said in an appearance on Fox News that Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to delete her emails \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is criminal in nature.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I mean, you cannot just destroy documents when an agency is telling you to turn them over,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Priebus said on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fox and Friends.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even Nixon didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t destroy the tapes,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Priebus said, referring to the Watergate scandal that ultimately led to President Richard M. Nixon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are thousands and thousands of emails that are missing.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In an interview Tuesday, Mr. Gowdy said Mr. Priebus had overstepped his expertise.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As far as I know, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not an expert in federal record-keeping law,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Gowdy said of Mr. Priebus. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m 100 percent positive he is not a member of the executive branch, which is charged with investigating and prosecuting under the law.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know enough facts, so why speculate?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Gowdy added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We should keep our conclusions and speculation to a minimum and follow the facts.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Asa Hutchinson, Republican of Arkansas, spoke on Wednesday about the future of what proponents call the religious freedom bill pending in his state, he disclosed that the proposal had drawn resistance from a particularly noteworthy critic: his son, Seth Hutchinson.\n But to people familiar with the Hutchinsons, long one of the most influential families in Arkansas, the news was hardly a bombshell.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would be surprising to me if he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do that,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Shawn Standefer, a childhood friend of the younger Mr. Hutchinson who captained their national championship-winning Quiz Bowl team in high school. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always been concerned with justice, however he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thought of it.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n And so it was on Saturday, with lawmakers nearing a vote on the legislation that critics said would legalize discrimination against gay people, that the younger Mr. Hutchinson wrote to his father and warned that the proposal could damage Arkansas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation and economy. It was only the latest chapter in a politically complicated relationship between Asa Hutchinson, a former congressman, and Seth Hutchinson, 31, an organizer for the Texas State Employees Union.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I love my dad, and we have a good, close relationship,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Seth Hutchinson said on Wednesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we disagree a lot on political issues. This is just another one, but a lot of families disagree politically. But we stay close.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Hutchinson has not always been what he described as the family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political \u00e2\u20ac\u0153black sheep.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I kind of grew up on the campaign trail,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Having a political opinion just came naturally to me. At first, I pretty much followed the values that my family and my parents laid out for me.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But, starting when he was about 15 and working as a dishwasher at a diner, Mr. Hutchinson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views began to change as he shuffled through other jobs, including stints at Chuck E. Cheese\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Sears. He grew frustrated when he saw older workers enduring financial hardships in low-paying jobs.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It just showed me that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something wrong,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said, adding that he became interested in gay rights at about the same time, when friends began discussing their sexual orientations and after the arrest of an art teacher, who was gay.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He was not out,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Hutchinson said of the teacher. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And he was arrested in a park \u00e2\u20ac\u201d I think the official charge was attempting to loiter \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and it was obvious he was there because he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be out and keep his job.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Hutchinson had robust political discussions with his father even as a high school student, long before their views diverged so vastly.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He would defend his views,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Standefer said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And as they changed, he tried to stand by his new views.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Hutchinson spent a year at Georgetown University before enrolling at the University of Central Arkansas, where he joined groups like the Young Democratic Socialists, and rallied for gay rights during the tenure of another Republican, Gov. Mike Huckabee. He would contact a cousin, Tim C. Hutchinson, who sat in the State House of Representatives, to register his views.\n Seth Hutchinson later moved to Texas and became a labor activist, which the governor mentions to left-leaning audiences.\n Father and son communicate regularly, Seth Hutchinson said, and the family gathers at least once or twice a year.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always a lively and engaging conversation,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Hutchinson said.\n On Wednesday, the governor said he would ask lawmakers to either recall or rewrite portions of the bill. Seth Hutchinson, though, refused to take credit.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I did not sway my dad,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think my dad is rethinking this because of the pressure that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coming at him from all sides.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

She also released a list of paid speeches showing that she had earned nearly $10 million in speaking fees in 2013, the year she left the State Department.\n The spate of voluntary disclosures on Friday, intended to highlight Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts at transparency, came after a week of renewed attention to her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Recent polls suggest that the focus on Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s email practices has affected the number of voters who see her as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153honest\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trustworthy.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In a statement, Mrs. Clinton highlighted the millions of dollars she said she and her husband had paid in taxes and given to charity, while lamenting what she called a lopsided tax code that favors wealthy people like them.\n The Clintons have grown immensely better off in the 15 years since they left the White House, primarily through book deals, paid speeches and other business ventures involving Mr. Clinton.\n Mrs. Clinton has devoted a fair amount of time since April, when she began her second presidential campaign, to showing she understands the needs of working-class Americans, who have not seen their wages grow in years, and those struggling in the post-recession job market.\n That effort was made particularly urgent after Mrs. Clinton said last year that she and her husband were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dead broke\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d when they left the White House. The remark was widely seized upon by Republicans who argued she was out of touch.\n The Clintons have previously released their tax returns for the period from 1977, when they entered public life, through 2006.\n The new ones show that from 2007 through 2014 the couple paid $43,885,310 in federal taxes, for an effective tax rate of 31.55 percent. They gave nearly $15 million to charity, or an average of 10.8 percent of their earnings. Their charitable deductions ranged from $550,000 in 2008 to more than $3 million in 2007, 2013 and 2014.\n All but $190,450 of their personal charitable giving passed through their philanthropic entity, the Clinton Family Foundation, the returns show. The beneficiaries of that foundation, which files a separate tax return, include their larger foundation ($1.865 million in 2014), as well as the Museum for African Art in New York, the Preventive Medicine Research Institute in California and the American Ireland Fund, based in New York.\n Among Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disclosures Friday was that she was paid $9.68 million in 2013 for 41 speeches, all in the United States except for two in Toronto. She topped out at $400,000 for a speech to the Jewish United Fund/Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Chicago. Her standard rate was $225,000.\n She gave three speeches to Goldman Sachs in 2013 and was paid a total of $675,000 for them; her husband was paid $200,000 by Goldman Sachs for a speech in New York, two days after Mrs. Clinton spoke to the bank in South Carolina, according to an accompanying list of his 2013 speaking fees.\n In all, Mr. Clinton earned $13.17 million in 2013, also for 41 speeches, the most lucrative of these, at $750,000, for addressing Handelsbanken Capital Markets in Stockholm that May; Mr. Clinton listed a second payment of $100,000 from the same company the same day. Fifteen of his speeches were abroad.\n Besides the royalties from his books and his speaking fees, Mr. Clinton earned nearly $20 million between 2011 and 2014 for advising or consulting companies.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come a long way from my days going door to door for the Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Defense Fund and earning $16,450 as a young law professor in Arkansas \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and we owe it to the opportunities America provides,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mrs. Clinton said in her statement.\n Her aides hope to set up a favorable contrast for her with former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, a leading Republican contender, who has argued he is more transparent than she is.\n A month ago, when Mr. Bush released his own tax returns, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One fun fact I learned in this process: I have paid a higher tax rate than the Clintons even though I earned less income.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Bush said his average federal tax rate was 36 percent, and contrasted that with what he said was the Clintons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 2014 tax rate: 30 percent. It was unclear where Mr. Bush got the figure.\n Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax return showed that her 2014 federal tax rate was 35.72, and, with city and state income taxes, was a combined rate of 45.8 percent. Florida has no state income tax.\n",

Here are his stances on important issues.\n Mr. Huckabee warns that radical Islam is a grave threat to the United States and says President Obama too frequently defends Islam. He supports forceful military action against the Islamic State.\n A strong defender of Israel, he has been sharply critical of Mr. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treatment of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and said a proposed nuclear deal with Iran is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrible\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d because Iran cannot be trusted. Mr. Huckabee has talked of the possibility of using military force against Iran.\n As governor of Arkansas in 2002, he called for lifting the economic embargo of Cuba, which would have helped rice farmers in his state. But he now opposes Mr. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warming of relations with Havana, calling Cuba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government tyrannical.\n In 2007 Mr. Huckabee was quoted as saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Climate change is here, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s real.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d But more recently he has minimized it as a threat, and said he opposes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cap and trade\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d legislation meant to curtail carbon emissions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This kind of mandatory energy policy would have a horrible impact on this nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job market,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n Mr. Huckabee opposes same-sex marriage, suggesting as recently as February that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice akin to drinking or swearing.\n Mr. Huckabee said Mr. Obama exceeded his authority by issuing executive actions shielding millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation. But Mr. Huckabee said the immigrant children whose parents brought them into the country illegally should not be deported because \u00e2\u20ac\u0153you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t punish a child for something his parents did.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Huckabee has focused his economic message on what he calls wage stagnation under Mr. Obama. But the former governor has opposed calls for a higher minimum wage, calling it government intrusion, and he has suggested that policies that encourage a dependency on federal benefits have helped hold wages down.\n Unlike other Republican candidates, Mr. Huckabee is a strong defender of entitlement programs, opposing plans to raise the retirement age for collecting Social Security and criticizing plans to curtail Medicare. Republicans who back such changes, he said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153are embracing a government that lied to its people \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that took money from its people under one pretense and then took it away at the time when they started wanting to actually get what they have paid for all these years.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

According to the returns, the Clintons earned $140,937,785 over the eight year span, primarily from book sales and speaking fees. The couple paid $43,885,310 in federal taxes and $13,625,777 in state and local taxes, and made $14,959,450 in charitable contributions during that time.\n Last year, the Clintons paid an effective federal tax rate of 35.7 percent and donated over 10 percent of their income to charity.\n \"We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come a long way from my days going door to door for the Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Defense Fund and earning $16,450 as a young law professor in Arkansas\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand we owe it to the opportunities America provides,\" Clinton said in a statement accompanying the returns. \"I want more Americans to have the chance to work hard and get ahead, just like we did.

Bush paid an effective tax rate of roughly 36 percent over those three decades.\n In May, Hillary Clinton filed a disclosure with the Federal Elections Commission showing the couple had earned approximately $30 million from book sales and speeches in 2014 and the first four months of 2015.\n",

The measure also allows Congress to approve or reject such deals, but not amend them.\n Courting Iowa voters, Clinton sought to address Democratic opponents of the trade legislation, including liberals and labor unions, who have said the Obama-backed plan will cost U.S. jobs. The agreement has not been finalized or submitted to Congress.\n \"The president should listen to and work with his allies in Congress, starting with Nancy Pelosi, who had expressed their concerns about the impact that a weak agreement would have on our workers to make sure we get the best strongest deal possible,\" Clinton said. \"And if we don't get it, there should be no deal.\"\n The White House and Republican leaders in Congress now face long odds in trying to revive the trade legislation after congressional Democrats helped defeat a job retraining program to jeopardize Obama's attempt to secure the fast-track authority.\n Clinton appeared to be seeking a middle ground, saying while some support the deal and others vehemently oppose it, \"I kind of fall in the group that says \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhat's in it?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 And \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclet's make it as good as it can be, and then let's make a decision.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n She said Obama had an \"amazing opportunity\" to negotiate better terms and reiterated the criteria of worker protections, wages and national security provisions she would seek in a final deal.\n Clinton said any deal should include the scuttled Trade Adjustment Assistance program to help retrain workers.\n Trade has emerged as an early divider within the Democratic primary.\n Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was campaigning in Iowa on Sunday, has opposed the trade deal and questioned Clinton's refusal to say where she stood.\n \"It is a failed trade policy, and I would hope that the Secretary joins Elizabeth Warren, and vast majority of Democrats in the Congress in saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNo, we've got to defeat this piece of legislation,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Sanders said on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley has also opposed the deal. In a sign of its resonance within the party, his campaign noted in an email to supporters Saturday that Clinton's speech in New York didn't \"weigh in on the secretive TPP deal that could depress American wages and cost American jobs.\"\n The Obama administration has said it remains confident there are ways to get the trade provisions through Congress.\n Republican leaders generally support Obama's trade proposal and have suggested they may try to revive the bill as early as this week.\n \"Republicans delivered,\" Wisconsin GOP Rep. Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"The question is: Are the Democrats going to do this to their president?\"\n While Clinton called the pact the \"gold standard\" of trade agreements while serving as secretary of state, she has refused to take a position on the deal since announcing her candidacy.\n That brought criticism from Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short on Sunday.\n \"By waffling on a trade deal she helped negotiate and once called a \"gold standard,\" Hillary Clinton continues to show why voters overwhelmingly see her as dishonest and untrustworthy,\" Short said in a statement.\n Clinton was spending most of the weekend in Iowa after formally launching her campaign in New York City, seeking to build an organizational edge in the state that tripped up her first presidential campaign against Obama.\n Sanders was campaigning across the state and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, who is exploring a potential Democratic bid, also was holding events in Iowa on Sunday. O'Malley held a day's events in the state last week.\n Earlier in the day, top Clinton advisers, including senior spokeswoman Karen Finney, said that Clinton is waiting to see the final deal and that she has explained her position in recent weeks.\n \"We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see where this process goes,\" Finney told Fox News. \"This is someone who has voted for trade agreements when they have been good for the country and against trade agreements when she thought they were bad for the country.\"\n Campaign Chairman John Podesta told NBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Meet the Press\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d that Clinton \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has a clear standard that (the deal) has got to be good for American workers or she thinks the United States should walk away from it.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., made the request in a letter sent Tuesday to Clinton's lawyer. Gowdy asked that Clinton agree to a \"transcribed\" interview -- and repeated a March 16 request for her to surrender her server so it can be examined by the State Department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inspector general.\n Gowdy said Friday that Clinton, the presumptive Democratic front-runner in the 2016 presidential race, has yet to adequately respond to the subpoena request for the server. He said the committee learned she had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unilaterally decided\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d to wipe it clean and permanently delete all emails.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This committee is left with no alternative but to request Secretary Clinton appear before this committee for a transcribed interview to better understand decisions the secretary made relevant to the creation, maintenance, retention, and ultimately deletion of public records,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Gowdy wrote to Clinton attorney David Kendall on Tuesday.\n Earlier this month, Clinton acknowledged that she sent or received roughly 60,000 related emails, turning over roughly half to the State Department and deleting about the same number of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d ones.\n The South Carolina Republican set a deadline of May 1 for the interview and restated the committee is interested only in the deleted emails relating to Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response as secretary of state to the 2012 terror attacks on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, in which four Americans were killed.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The committee believes a transcribed interview would best protect Secretary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s privacy, the security of the information queried, and the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest in ensuring this committee has all information needed to accomplish the task set before it,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Gowdy also wrote in the letter.\n Gowdy suggested Monday that he wants to have \"separate conversations\" with Clinton about Benghazi and the emails, in light of her wiping clean the server.\n \"I need to ask what she did (with the server) and when she did it and importantly why she did it,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said on Fox News' \"On the Record with Greta Van Susteren.\"\n He also suggested on the show and in the letter that efforts to get Clinton to comply with the requests might require the full weight of the Republican-led House and that he will confer with House Speaker John Boehner about whether another committee will be involved.\n Clinton has not yet announced a presidential bid.\n",

Trump from becoming president \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and would work closely with Hillary Clinton to make that happen.\n After the meeting with Mr. Obama, which lasted more than an hour, Mr. Sanders gave no indication that he was ready to leave the race just yet, insisting that he would compete in next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s primary contest here in Washington. However, he made clear that party unity was on his mind.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will work as hard as I can, to make sure that Donald Trump does not become president of the United States,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Sanders told reporters, saying the Manhattan businessman \u00e2\u20ac\u0153makes bigotry and discrimination the cornerstone of his campaign\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and would be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disaster\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d as commander in chief.\n He said he would continue fighting for the issues that animated his campaign, including enhancing Social Security benefits, college affordability and restoring the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crumbling infrastructure.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These are the issues that we will take to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Sanders said, declining to answer reporters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 shouted questions about whether he would leave the race.\n Shortly after their meeting, Mr. Obama endorsed Mrs. Clinton in a video. He also praised the campaign that Mr. Sanders ran.\n The visit came a day after the senator huddled with his team at his headquarters in Vermont to discuss the fate of his candidacy.\n Mr. Sanders, who requested the meeting with the president, pulled into the White House grounds at 10:56 a.m. after stopping at a nearby Peet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Coffee for a scone. Mr. Obama and Mr. Sanders strolled down the colonnade next to the Rose Garden on their way into the Oval Office, chatting inaudibly and grinning broadly. Nearby, a thick line of cameras and cluster of microphones were assembled in the driveway outside the West Wing, where journalists peppered the Vermont senator with questions.\n Mr. Obama was trying to negotiate, however gently, with him to exit the Democratic race without inflicting damage on efforts to unite the party.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My hope is, is that over the next couple of weeks, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re able to pull things together,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Obama said during a taping of an appearance on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d on Wednesday in New York. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a natural process of everybody recognizing that this is not about any individual.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Briefly posing for photographers before his meeting in the Capitol with Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, Mr. Sanders ignored three questions about Mr. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s endorsement of Mrs. Clinton.\n His face flushed, Mr. Sanders did not speak at all. But Mr. Reid gently scolded the assembled journalists for asking questions at what was supposed to be just a photo opportunity.\n After his meeting with Reid, Mr. Sanders made a quick exit through a back hall on his way to meet with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York. He was also scheduled to meet with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n After Mrs. Clinton won Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s California primary, Mr. Sanders refused to quit the race, despite Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wide margin of victory and the fact that she had the support of enough delegates for the nomination. But some of his supporters have started to walk away, prompting growing calls that it is time to bring the party together to defeat Mr. Trump.\n On Wednesday, Mr. Sanders sent out a fund-raising email asking for contributions of $2.70, and at 7 p.m. he will hold a rally outside of R.F.K. Stadium in Washington, where he will discuss his plans for getting big money out of politics and making public universities tuition free.\n",

For the court, it could be \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even want to contemplate that.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n That tracks a comment she made in a separate interview with The Associated Press, when the justice stopped short of noting she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather have presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton making future appointments to the Supreme Court.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to think about that possibility,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ginsburg said when asked to consider Trump in the role of appointer-in-chief.\n Now a number of legal academics and Supreme Court observers are raising questions about the propriety of Ginsburg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s candor and what it might mean for the court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s integrity \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 with some suggesting she might have to recuse herself from considering any Trump-related case that reaches the high court.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The other justices should hold an intervention, and tell her to be quiet or step down,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d wrote Josh Blackman, a Houston College of Law professor who frequently writes about the high court. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t funny anymore.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d He added that Ginsburg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beyond the pale.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Rick Hasen, another avid court watcher who specializes in election law, wrote that Ginsburg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statements could very well lead a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reasonable person\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d to question her impartiality in a future politically charged case.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think this is ultimately a question for judicial ethicists, but I do think following these comments it is a legitimate question to raise, should Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign come to the Court with any legal questions before the election,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he wrote in his widely read Election Law Blog.\n Dmitry Bam, a professor at the University of Maine School of Law who has written on judicial recusals and ethics, said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there is little question that she has crossed a line.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For a court that cares a great deal about appearances, this certainly creates the appearance that justices take sides in elections,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Bam wrote in an email. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And if Trump v. Clinton arises in the fall, I would say that there is at the very least an appearance of bias if Justice Ginsburg participates.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Under federal law, justices must step aside from cases where their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153impartiality might reasonably be questioned\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 and they did so in 180 cases during the court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last term, according to a new analysis by Fix the Court, a group that pushes for structural reform at the Supreme Court.\n Fix the Court found that the bulk of recent recusals were due to the justices\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 prior work as appellate judges or in government positions. Other recusals were related to stock ownership and family ties to judges or lawyers who participated in earlier stages of the cases.\n But recusals for political views or implicit support for certain positions are exceedingly rare, even in the face of a code of judicial conduct that guides federal judges on extra-judicial activities and how to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.\n Even with that guidance and other self-imposed checks in place, the justices have time and again declined to step aside in cases of high political salience \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 most recently in the same-sex marriage cases, where Ginsburg and Justices Elena Kagan and Clarence Thomas all took part despite calls for them to recuse.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not aware [that] any justice before has ever commented on the merits or demerits of a presidential candidate,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Ed Whelan, the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a frequent contributor to the conservative National Review Online, where he has chronicled this episode and what he deems Ginsburg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remarkable record of indiscretions.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I may very well share her concerns about Donald Trump ... but the ethics concerns don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t depend on the soundness or unsoundness of the candidate,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Whelan added.\n But what if this is less a question about ethics and more about wanting our judges to be candid about their positions and biases \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 and that the political process itself has done away with the veneer that the high court is entirely apolitical?\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most people now recognize that judges are heavily influenced by their personal beliefs and experiences,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Bam, of the Maine School of Law.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have watched one party refuse to hold hearings based the politics of the president and his potential nominees. Judges time their retirements to coincide with a certain party being in office. And the 5-4 decision in Bush v. Gore, along partisan lines, also shows the political nature of the court,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Bam said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So perhaps the pretense that judges are nonpartisan and apolitical does more harm than good.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Trump is heading to Mexico on Wednesday to meet with President Enrique Pe\u00c3\u00b1a Nieto, but one of the Mexican leader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predecessors had a different message for the Republican presidential nominee: You are not welcome here.\n Vicente Fox, Mexico\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president from 2000 to 2006, said on Wednesday that the invitation from Mr. Pe\u00c3\u00b1a Nieto was a mistake and that Mr. Trump should never be trusted in the country because of the way he has demonized its people.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He is not welcome to Mexico,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Fox told CNN. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want him. We reject his visit.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Fox has been critical of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to build a wall on the border between the United States and Mexico and on Wednesday he shrugged off recent signs of Mr. Trump softening his plans to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You cannot trust a guy like this,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Fox said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How can we grant confidence and support to ideas that change everyday? He cynically continues to disregard his own people and disregard Mexicans.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Despite Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promises that Mexico will pay for his border wall, Mr. Fox vowed in February that it would never happen. He also called Mr. Trump a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153false prophet\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d who was misleading his followers.\n On Wednesday, Mr. Fox expressed disbelief that Mr. Pe\u00c3\u00b1a Nieto would invite Mr. Trump for the private meeting. He suggested that Mr. Trump was only coming as part of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153desperate\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d strategy to improve his sagging poll numbers and in explicit terms he urged Americans not to vote for him.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I cannot envision him sitting in that chair, that was the chair of President Washington, President Jefferson, President Kennedy, President Reagan,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Fox said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how to run a nation. He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even know how to run a business.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n As he prepared to travel to Mexico, Mr. Trump responded to Mr. Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attacks, noting on Twitter that the former Mexican president once suggested that he pay the country a visit.\n Mr. Fox fired back with a Twitter post of his own, reminding Mr. Trump that he invited him to come to Mexico and personally apologize to all Mexicans.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stop lying!\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Fox wrote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mexico is not yours to play with, show some respect.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got the money.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n While Fox said that he believes that Americans will not elect the real estate tycoon to the White House, he is concerned about the results of the Nevada caucus, in which, according to entrance polls, Trump won 44 percent of the Hispanic vote.\n \"I would like to know who those Hispanics are, because they are followers of a false prophet,\" Fox said. \"He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to take them to the desert, and if they think that they will benefit with an administration led by Donald Trump, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re wrong. They must open their eyes. Please, you Hispanics in the U.S. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c open your eyes.\"\n Fox added, \"It is not to defend our race, it is not to defend our creed, but to defend the same nation that is hosting you. This nation is going to fail if it falls into the hands of a crazy man.\"\n The former Mexican president, who led the country from 2000 to 2006, also questioned Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allegiance to the Republican party, or, for that matter, any political party.\n \"He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a Republican. Absolutely not,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Fox said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those are not Republican principles. He is not a Democrat. He is just himself. He is egocentric.\"\n The comments from Fox echo those of his successor, Felipe Calder\u00c3\u00b3n, who a week ago asserted that Mexico will not pay for a border wall.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mexican people, we are not going to pay a single cent for such a stupid wall! And it's going to be completely useless,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Calder\u00c3\u00b3n told CNBC.\n For months, Trump has stood by his initial comments about building a border wall and getting Mexico to pay for it. The morning after Calder\u00c3\u00b3n made the comments, the GOP front-runner appeared on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I heard the head of Mexico said \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno way,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and I said, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNow the wall just got taller,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Trump said.\n Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interview on Fusion comes about 6 months after Ramos had his own very public skirmish with Trump in which the Spanish-language news icon confronted the billionaire during a press conference in Iowa \u00e2\u20ac\u201c prompting the candidate's security team to remove Ramos from the room.\n Ramos later returned and Trump took several of his questions.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He tried to silence me,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the Mexican-born journalist told Fox News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Megyn Kelly in August. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And in this country, you cannot do that. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a citizen. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m an immigrant. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a reporter. And I have the right in this country to ask any question I want, to whomever I want.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Ramos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 interview with Fox also occurred as U.S. Vice President Joe Biden paid a visit to Mexico for an economic summit. Biden made a thinly-veiled attack on Trump on Thursday, decrying the reality TV star\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \"dangerous\" rhetoric.\n \"Some of the rhetoric coming from some presidential candidates of the other team are, I think, dangerous, damaging and incredibly ill-advised,\" Biden said, according to AFP. \"I'm here to tell you: They do not, they do not, they do not represent the view of the vast majority of the American people.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

LePage, the embattled Republican governor of Maine, declared on Wednesday that he would not step down despite widespread criticism over a profane threat and generalizations about drugs and race that had prompted him to hint on Tuesday that he might abort his second term.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will not resign,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Mr. LePage, who tried to put to rest swirling questions about his state of mind.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not an alcoholic, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a drug addict, and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have mental issues,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What I have is a backbone.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. LePage nevertheless said he was seeking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spiritual guidance,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d had apologized for his threat, and vowed to make one change to his behavior: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will no longer speak to the press ever again after today,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n Behind the scenes, state lawmakers \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Democrats and Senate Republicans \u00e2\u20ac\u201d exasperated after six years of political controversies and what they saw as erratic behavior, were scrambling to figure out what, if anything, they could do to formally address this latest crisis.\n The controversy, which has galvanized the state, started last Wednesday when Mr. LePage made sweeping statements linking minorities to the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drug crisis. As criticism against him swelled, Mr. LePage came to believe that a Democratic lawmaker had called him a racist. The governor then left him an expletive-laden voicemail message, which he followed up by threatening to shoot the lawmaker between the eyes. In the ensuing days, Mr. LePage also reiterated his insistence that blacks and Hispanics were the vast majority of those arrested for dealing heroin in Maine.\n Both Democrats and Republicans have denounced the remarks, as many legislators called for a special session to at least rebuke the governor over his latest tirade. The state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s four legislative caucuses have said that they believe all four would have to agree for a special session to be scheduled.\n But on Tuesday, Mr. LePage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Republican allies in the House, including the minority leader, Kenneth Fredette, announced that they would oppose those efforts \u00e2\u20ac\u201d essentially shielding him from any official political consequence.\n That decision did not sit well with some other state Republicans, and on Wednesday morning, the spotlight shifted to them as the president of the Senate, whose members govern larger and more competitive districts, made a public break with his colleagues in the House.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With all due respect, I completely disagree with Representative Fredette\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the Republican leader, Michael Thibodeau, said in a statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Republican senate caucus has clearly stated that we need an acceptable plan for corrective action before the determination of whether the Legislature should convene is made.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Thibodeau said many Senate Republicans were still deciding whether or not Mr. LePage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apology and promise to seek \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spiritual guidance\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d had allayed their concerns about the governor \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a process that could deepen their divide with Republicans in the House and pull the controversy into a second week.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There should be consequences for our actions,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Thibodeau said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re really struggling.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n There is no precedent for such a situation here \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a fact that has sent lawmakers like Senator Roger Katz, a Republican who has been critical of Mr. LePage, back to reading their state Constitutions on Wednesday to figure out what, if anything, they could do now to convene a special session. Mr. Katz, a lawyer, suggested it may require only a simple majority of the House and senate, which could reduce the House Republicans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to block such a move, although he added there could be other hurdles to an agreement.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never been done before, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a little bit of uncharted waters,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Mr. Katz, who said he wanted Mr. LePage to get \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a competent evaluation and follow the recommendations of the evaluator.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Democrats have continued to call for Mr. LePage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ouster, and on Wednesday said they were scheduling meetings with Republican leadership to discuss how to proceed.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Coming back in for a special session will be discussed and all options around the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political future are on the table,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said the Democratic leader of the Senate, Justin Alfond.\n Mr. LePage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s six years in office here, which began as part of the Tea Party sweep in 2010, have been marked by controversy. Even as he fueled outrage among Democrats and angst among many moderate Republicans, his well of support, fed by voters drawn to his unfiltered political style, never seemed to run dry.\n By all indications, Mr. LePage seemed determined to again ride out the political storm.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I want to put this behind us,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. LePage said, during a meeting with a select group of reporters in his office on Wednesday morning, adding, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will never talk about it again.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. LePage spoke shortly after he met with \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and apologized to \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Representative Drew Gattine, the state Democratic lawmaker who had been the recipient of the angry voice mail. And in meeting with reporters, Mr. LePage spoke emotionally about Maine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heroin crisis.\n But he but did not apologize for statements he made last week that linked trafficking in the drug to blacks and Hispanics.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use racially charged language,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. LePage claimed, although he also said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leave ethnicity out of it.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

But more than 60 Democrats voted against her \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 a stunning level of dissent at a time when the party is trying to pick up the pieces after a disastrous presidential election.\n Pelosi defeated her lone challenger, Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio), by a vote of 134 to 63. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a decisive win, and it (barely) clears the two-thirds majority support that Pelosi predicted she had. But it reveals that dozens in her caucus voted against her in secret ballots. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a whole lot of anger,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said one Democrat who opposed her, who requested anonymity in order to speak freely. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m astounded that this caucus refuses to acknowledge reality and change.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Pelosi has led House Democrats since 2003, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what Ryan had argued is the problem. The same people have been running the caucus for years \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 Pelosi, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (Md.) and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn (S.C.) \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all in their 70s now. Some say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not the right messengers to energize the base and convey an economic message that appeals to people beyond the two coasts.\n House Democrats have also lost nearly 60 seats over the past six years. They picked up just six seats in this election cycle \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 far fewer than expected.\n Pelosi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supporters said her experience is what the party needs now more than ever, going up against President-elect Donald Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress: She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s battle-tested, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a prolific fundraiser and she knows better than anyone how to count votes and keep her party together.\n They say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not her fault when Democrats lose at the polls, either.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really blame Nancy Pelosi for gerrymandering and for the national election,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) told reporters.\n She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the only woman in top House and Senate leadership. If Ryan had replaced her, it would have become all white men.\n The California Democrat spoke briefly to reporters after the vote, saying she feels \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exhilarated\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d at being re-elected.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today has a special excitement for me because I think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at a time where it is well beyond politics. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about the character of America,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Pelosi said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How we go forward in our caucus to put forth our values, which are what unite us a caucus, to differentiate between us and the administration that will come into Washington in January, to take that message clearly to the public, is something that is a historic challenge.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know how to win elections,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done it in the past. We will do it again by making that differentiation.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Asked about the 63 Democrats who voted for Ryan, Pelosi said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I got two-thirds of the vote.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Separately, Ryan told reporters the race didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn out as he wanted but he thinks he did \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a pretty good job\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d of bringing economic issues to the forefront.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think we got the message out,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I believe in my heart, if we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to win as Democrats, we have to have the kind of message that resonates in every corner of this country.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n During the closed-door caucus meeting, several Democrats went to bat for Pelosi. Reps. Adam Schiff (Calif.), Gwen Moore (Wis.), Bill Pascrell (N.J.), Katherine Clark (Mass.), Joaquin Castro (Texas) and Debbie Dingell (Mich.) each gave nominating speeches for her.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everything we care about [is] at risk,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Schiff told the room. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need the very best to lead us. No one is a better tactician than Nancy Pelosi. No one does it better. No one even comes close.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Dingell said she has spoken \u00e2\u20ac\u0153endlessly\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d to Pelosi about appealing to Midwestern voters, and said she gets it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Leader Pelosi always listened and she always understood.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Pelosi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s understanding of Midwesterners, or lack thereof, is what Ryan highlighted as the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest problem. He said the California progressive has lost the connection with working-class people in the Midwest \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 the same people who make up his district, and the same people who turned out in droves to vote for Trump and help defeat Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton weeks ago.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you see working-class people, blue-collar people, going and voting for Trump, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a failure of the Democratic Party because they felt like we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about them,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ryan said earlier this month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That just makes my stomach sick.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Pelosi did not agree with Ryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment in a Monday interview with The Huffington Post.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even carry his district for Hillary Clinton, so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s saying that,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have strong support from our friends in the unions, including steelworkers, which I guess are his area ... I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a woman of steel in there.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

But while Ms. Pelosi won, 134 to 63, Mr. Ryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significant share of the total served as a measure of internal discontent and in some ways a repudiation of Ms. Pelosi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of soul-searching,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney of New York. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And a lot of really wanting to have a plan.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n For years, support for Ms. Pelosi has run so deep that few would even consider challenging her. In 2010, after a wave of Tea Party Republicans swept Democrats out of power, she lost just 43 votes.\n Ms. Pelosi, whose victory was mockingly cheered by Republicans as good news for them, dismissed the idea that House Democrats could no longer win with her at the helm. And she vowed that Democrats would continue to stand as a foil to President-elect Donald J. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know how to win elections,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ms. Pelosi said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done it in the past. We will do it again by making that differentiation.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Representative Kurt Schrader of Oregon, who backed Mr. Ryan, said after the vote that unless Democrats changed course and adopted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a working man and woman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d they should expect defeat.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very worried we just signed the Democratic Party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death certificate for the next decade and a half,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Schrader said.\n Democrats also re-elected Representative Steny H. Hoyer, 77, of Maryland as whip, the No. 2 position, as well as Representative James E. Clyburn, 76, of South Carolina in the No. 3 spot as the assistant Democratic leader. Mr. Hoyer and Mr. Clyburn have been part of the Democratic leadership team since 2003 and 2007. Both ran unopposed.\n Representative Joseph Crowley of New York was also elected chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, and in a narrow victory, 98 to 96, Representative Linda T. S\u00c3\u00a1nchez of California defeated another California Democrat, Representative Barbara Lee, to become vice chairwoman.\n After a dismal Election Day for Democrats, the fight for Ms. Pelosi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post had become a proxy battle for the future of the party, with House Democrats agonizing over how to reconnect with the working-class voters who abandoned them.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We got wiped out in the Midwest, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re toxic in rural America,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d aides said Mr. Ryan told his colleagues behind closed doors before the vote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ultimately, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re responsible.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But in an interview Tuesday, Mr. Ryan suggested few ideas for how to appeal to voters beyond essentially crowdsourcing the task to more House Democrats, and he offered no indication that working with the Republican majority on any particular policy compromises would be a priority.\n The Democratic leaders seemed short on concrete strategies, too, committing generally to refocus their message on economic issues. Many also vowed to stand in opposition to the Trump administration, gambling that Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans would disappoint voters and prompt a return to the Democratic Party they rejected.\n Some of the more specific strategies considered included starting a more aggressive recruitment campaign for Democratic candidates from more conservative areas, as well as increasing their outreach to traditionally \u00e2\u20ac\u0153red\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d districts.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Just because you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only getting 30 percent of the vote in some area doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean you shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go there,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Representative Cedric L. Richmond of Louisiana. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You should go there and engage people and tell them what you believe in.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Disappointed by the outcome of the leadership election, a handful of Democrats who had backed Mr. Ryan vowed to press forward with a proposal to turn some jobs, such as the chairman of the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign arm, into elected positions.\n That plan is expected to meet resistance from Ms. Pelosi, who retains the power to appoint people to those positions, though some Democrats have expressed an interest in the idea. Last week Ms. Pelosi selected Representative Ben Ray Luj\u00c3\u00a1n of New Mexico to again lead the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, even though House Democrats picked up just six seats in this election.\n Though he collected only a dozen or so public endorsements, Mr. Ryan mounted an unlikely challenge to Ms. Pelosi, long considered a legislative and fund-raising powerhouse. Driven by the conviction that Democrats need a new leader, he tried to harness discontent with a leadership team that has failed three times to reclaim the majority since being swept out in 2010.\n Trying to quell calls to replace her, Ms. Pelosi announced her nominations last week for a handful of other positions, and proposed that three members from Illinois, Pennsylvania and New York share the leadership duties of the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s messaging committee, offering more regional diversity. She also released plans to incorporate more junior members into leadership roles, among other ideas, such as including a freshman Democrat in the leadership team\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regular meetings.\n But each new idea has underscored the fact that Ms. Pelosi refuses to relinquish much power and has cultivated a large, loyal following that does not expect her to. It is from that sizable collection of House Democrats that she draws her picks for smaller leadership posts, making her a powerful ally and, for those like Mr. Ryan who have challenged her, a formidable opponent.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She has a lot of friends,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Ryan said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is her caucus, clearly.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) might be coming to an end.\n According to the White House, Obama spoke to both Clinton and Sanders by phone following Tuesday's primaries and caucuses and will meet with Sanders on Thursday, at Sanders' request.\n \"The President congratulated Secretary Clinton for securing the delegates necessary to clinch the Democratic Nomination for President. Her historic campaign inspired millions and is an extension of her lifelong fight for middle-class families and children,\" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement.\n \"The President thanked Senator Sanders for energizing millions of Americans with his commitment to issues like fighting economic inequality and special interests' influence on our politics.\"\n Obama will meet with Sanders in Washington on Thursday, the same day the Vermont senator plans to hold a rally there. The meeting was arranged \"at Senator Sanders' request,\" Earnest said, and the two will discuss \"how to build on the extraordinary work he has done to engage millions of Democratic voters, and to build on that enthusiasm in the weeks and months ahead.\"\n Obama has yet to make an endorsement in the race, but White House officials have said that it could come as early as this week.\n In recent months, Obama has privately suggested that Sanders drop out of the race to help Democrats unite around Clinton and prepare for the general election. He has also shown an eagerness to assail presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump, which could be an important asset in helping Clinton defeat Trump in the general election.\n",

Her mind is shot - resign!\n The liberal icon justice had kicked off the storm with comments to The New York Times published Saturday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine what this place would be \u00e2\u20ac\u201d I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine what the country would be -- with Donald Trump as our president. For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be -- I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even want to contemplate that,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she said.\n She doubled down late Monday, telling CNN: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He is a faker.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \"He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego. ... How has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns? The press seems to be very gentle with him on that,\" she said.\n Trump swiftly responded Tuesday, telling the Times it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly inappropriate that a United States Supreme Court judge gets involved in a political campaign.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a disgrace to the court and I think she should apologize to the court. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe it when I saw it,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the presumptive Republican nominee said.\n Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticisms were echoed by Republican congressional leaders. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday Ginsburg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153totally inappropriate.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \"It raises a level of skepticism that the American people have from time to time about just how objective the Supreme Court is, whether they're over there to call the balls and strikes, or weigh in on one side or another,\" he said.\n House Speaker Paul Ryan used similar language at a CNN event Tuesday.\n \"For someone on the Supreme Court who is going to be calling balls and strikes in the future based upon whatever the next president and Congress does, that strikes me as inherently biased and out of the realm,\" Ryan said.\n Ginsburg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments also left Democratic lawmakers squirming.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We all know that the justices on the Supreme Court have political views. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re well served by them airing them out in the open,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Politico.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She may have got out over her skis a little bit and more forthright and political than she should have been. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very unusual,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told the outlet.\n Mainstream media outlets also joined in the chorus of criticism.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However valid her comments may have been, though, and however in keeping with her known political bent, they were still much, much better left unsaid by a member of the Supreme Court,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d The Washington Post\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s editorial board said Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The board noted the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges says that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153judge should not ... publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The New York Times also chimed in: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Washington is more than partisan enough without the spectacle of a Supreme Court justice flinging herself into the mosh pit.\"\n Wednesday morning brought some relief for the under-fire justice, with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders giving qualified support for her comments. While the Democratic presidential candidate declined to comment on whether her comments were appropriate, he said on ABC he agrees Trump is a \"total opportunist\" and said \"the record is quite clear that he lies just a whole lot of the time.\"\n",

He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got the money.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The GOP front-runner, who has made many outrageous comments about Latinos including calling Mexican immigrants \"criminals\" and \"rapists,\" insists he'll coerce Mexico into paying for a wall to keep undocumented migrants out of the U.S. if he's elected. (The real estate mogul estimates the price tag at around $8 billion.)\n Fox, however, isn't worried that Trump will actually win the presidency.\n \"Democracy cannot pick crazy people that doesn't know what's going on in the world today,\" he said.\n Ramos pointed out that Trump likely won among Hispanics during Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nevada caucus -- a statistic that has a few caveats.\n \"I'd like to know who those Hispanics are,\" Fox said. \"They're followers of a false prophet.\"\n Felipe Calderon, who was president of Mexico from 2006 to 2012, has also dismissed Trump's idea.\n \"Mexican people, we are not going to pay any single cent for such a stupid wall,\" he said earlier this month. \"And it's going to be completely useless. ... If this guy pretends that closing the borders to anywhere either for trade [or] for people is going to provide prosperity to the United States, he is completely crazy.\"\n",

Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday was appointed to an eighth term as House minority leader, surviving a challenge from a Midwestern Democrat backed by caucus members frustrated over repeated election loses and an aging leadership team.\n Pelosi was challenged by Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan in a secret-ballot vote among House Democrats. She won by a 134-to-63 vote.\n Pelosi said afterward that she was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exhilarated\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d by the strong support and reminded reporters that she had accurately predicted winning two-thirds of the vote.\n She has winning brought \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a special spring in my step\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d because it gives her the opportunity to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153differentiate between us and the administration coming in January.\"\n Ryan, after a disappointing 2016 election cycle for Democrats, argued that newer lawmakers in the party need a bigger, fresher voice to represent them, instead of the same slate of leaders and committee chairmen.\n He represents northeast Ohio, a region full of the type of disaffected union workers and former Democrats who helped Republican Donald Trump win that battleground state and the White House.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Clearly, this didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn out the way we wanted,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ryan said after the vote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We knew it was going to be an uphill battle. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We needed to get out the economic message. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m disappointed, but I think the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better off because of this.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge, among the handful of House Democrats who backed Ryan's bid, said the effort to unseat Pelosi was not a failure.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lose today,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she said, interrupting reporters at the post-vote press conference. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We now have a leadership team that listens to us. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Today, we made our caucus more representative of our members.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Another criticism among rank-and-file House Democrats was that the top posts are largely filled by East and West coast members, not those from the heartland.\n Pelosi has led House Democrats since 2002. Democrats lost the House majority in the 2010 Tea Party-inspired wave election. And Republican-led redistricting has made chances of a Democratic comeback increasingly difficult.\n The 76-year-old Pelosi, in the months prior to the Nov. 8 elections, repeatedly vowed that her party would retake control of the lower chamber, despite needing to gain roughly 35 seats.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know how to win elections,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she said Wednesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done it in the past and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do it again. This is so much bigger that politics.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Pelosi also described her upcoming role of contrasting Democrats to Republican President-elect Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incoming administration as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153historic challenge\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d that goes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beyond politics.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Leadership elections were originally scheduled to be held before Thanksgiving but were delayed to give Democrats more time to discuss and process the election results and consider a path forward. Many are discouraged after losing the White House and making smaller than expected gains in both chambers of Congress.\n \"I believe we must do more than simply paper over the cracks,\" said Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, one of a handful of House Democrats to endorse Ryan. \"We can't just say the right things -- we must take concrete steps to move our party in the right direction.\"\n In the days before Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote, Pelosi, a prolific fundraiser, promised some changes to assuage concerns in her caucus, including adding a member of the freshmen class to her leadership team.\n She won despite her proposals doing little to ensure new blood at the very top or changing the seniority system that has key committees led by lawmakers in their 80s at a moment when the party needs to be defending ObamaCare and other initiatives by President Obama.\n Republicans are on track to hold at least 240 seats in the House next year. Democrats, who had high hopes of significant gains in the election, picked up just six seats on Election Day earlier this month and remain in the minority with 194 seats.\n Rep. Loretta Sanchez won the competition for vice Democratic Caucus chairman, defeating fellow California congresswoman Barbara Lee.\n Lee is a former Congressional Black Caucus chairman. Sanchez formerly led the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n Democrats until Wednesday had never had a female minority in their leadership ranks.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m really honored and emotional to be standing here among a group of such great leaders,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Sanchez said in second, late-afternoon press conference led by Pelosi.\n Other top leadership posts were uncontested.\n Reps. Steny Hoyer, Maryland, kept the No. 2 job of House minority whip, and Jim Clyburn, South Carolina, remained in No. 3 position of assistant leader.\n",

For that reason alone, he should step down. If Hillary Clinton, after this attack, still cannot say the two words 'Radical Islam' she should get out of this race for the Presidency,\" Trump said in a statement released by his campaign.\n \"If we do not get tough and smart real fast, we are not going to have a country anymore. Because our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it is only going to get worse. I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack. We can't afford to be politically correct anymore,\" the statement continued.\n In their remarks on Sunday, both Obama and Clinton referred to the shooting as an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153act of terror\" and an \"act of hate.\" Obama last year explained that he refuses to describe the self-proclaimed Islamic State and al Qaeda as groups fueled by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153radical Islam\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d because the term grants them a religious legitimacy they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deserve.\n Trump noted in his statement that the gunman, Omar Mateen, was \"the son of an immigrant from Afghanistan who openly published his support for the Afghanistani Taliban and even tried to run for President of Afghanistan.\" According to the Washington Post, Seddique Mateen expressed gratitude toward the Afghan Taliban in videos posted online. His son had reportedly pledged allegiance to ISIS before executing the attack, though officials say there is no evidence he had direct ties to the group.\n Trump also criticized Clinton, his presumptive Democratic challenger, for wanting to \"dramatically increase admissions\" of Syrian refugees into the United States.\n \"We need to protect all Americans, of all backgrounds and all beliefs, from Radical Islamic Terrorism - which has no place in an open and tolerant society,\" Trump said. \"Radical Islam advocates hate for women, gays, Jews, Christians and all Americans. I am going to be a President for all Americans, and I am going to protect and defend all Americans.\"\n In a follow-up tweet posted later Sunday, Trump reiterated his call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States -- even though the Orlando gunman was an American citizen, born in New York. He obtained his weapons legally, despite having been investigated by the FBI several times.\n Trump's campaign said he would be delivering a \"major speech\" in New Hampshire on Monday that would address \"this terrorist attack, immigration, and national security.\"\n",

Gattine said after their meeting he believes the governor should resign even though he apologized for the voicemail.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every day, Paul LePage gives Maine people more evidence that he is unfit for office,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d State House Majority Leader Jeff McCabe (D) and Assistant House Majority Leader Sara Gideon (D) said in a statement Tuesday night. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The governor is not mentally able to serve and needs to resign.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not an alcoholic and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a drug addict and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have mental issues,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d LePage replied Wednesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What I have is a backbone, and I want to move Maine forward.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He said he will be seeking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spiritual guidance\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d from his family.\n Members of LePage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own party have been trying to deal with the headaches he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s caused as well, with one GOP state senator even talking about censuring him. State House Minority Leader Ken Fredette (R) said Tuesday night that he would not support bringing the legislature back into a special session to consider sanctions against LePage \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 a position that his counterpart in the Senate wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t back.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With all due respect, I completely disagree with Fredette\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Senate President Mike Thibodeau (R) said Wednesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Republican Senate caucus has clearly stated that we need an acceptable plan for corrective action before the determination of whether the Legislature should convene is made.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The latest controversy really dates back to January, when LePage claimed that drug dealers with names like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Smoothie, D-Money and Shifty\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d come into Maine and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153impregnate a young, white girl before they leave.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Last week, LePage tried to back up that statement \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 which had been widely criticized at the time \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 by saying he keeps a binder of drug dealers arrested in Maine and \u00e2\u20ac\u015390-plus percent of those pictures\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d in his book are of black and Hispanic individuals.\n LePage was upset because he mistakenly believed Gattine heard those remarks and called him a racist, and so he left him the voicemail. Gattine denied to the Portland Press Herald that he ever called the governor a racist.\n LePage has long been clear about his distaste for the media. He has said newspapers are his greatest fear and joked about blowing up the headquarters of the Portland Press Herald.\n",

Ted Cruz has laid down the gauntlet in the growing war of words with Donald Trump over the Republican presidential candidates\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 wives.\n The Texas lawmaker blamed his rival for the National Enquirer story published Friday that alleged Cruz has had extramarital affairs, and after hits from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign about the mental health of his wife, the firebrand senator appears to be backing away from his pledge to support Trump if the billionaire real estate mogul wins the GOP nomination.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a habit out of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my family,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Cruz said at a press conference after a Wisconsin rally, according to The Hill.\n He added, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald Trump is not going to be the Republican nominee.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Earlier in the campaign, GOP candidates signed a promise not to run as an independent if they were not nominated. The move was meant to convince voters that Trump would remain faithful to the Republican Party even if he lost.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is garbage, complete and utter lies,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Cruz said about the National Enquirer article alleging that he has had multiple affairs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a tabloid smear, and it has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson responded to claims that she is one of the mystery women referred to in the article, stating on Twitter that the allegation is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stupidity on all levels.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of course the National Enquirer story is 100 percent false!,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Pierson tweeted.\n Of course the National Enquirer story is 100% FALSE!!! I only speak to myself, however.\n Earlier this year, the tabloid endorsed Trump for president with an issue that included an article giving ten reasons why the reality TV star is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153only choice for the White House.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The intensely personal feud between Cruz and Trump began earlier this week when a super PAC that opposes Trump posted a meme-style ad featuring a naked Melania Trump that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s then-girlfriend, a professional model, posed for more that 15 years ago for British GQ.\n Make America Awesome PAC paid for the ads and posted them on Facebook and Instagram.\n The photo features Mrs. Trump sprawled out naked on a fur rug inside a Boeing 727.

Or you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n An angry Trump lashed out at Cruz on Twitter, calling the senator a liar, as he has alleged before in the campaign, and threatening to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spill the beans\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d about Cruz's wife Heidi.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a GQ shoot in his ad,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Trump said on the social media site. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Cruz quickly retorted by saying that the ads did not come not from his campaign, and called Trump a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coward\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d threatening to go after his wife.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pic of your wife not from us,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Cruz said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald, if you try to attack Heidi, you're more of a coward than I thought. #classless.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The lurch into the sort of personal territory that's normally off limits in campaigns occurred as an anti-Trump super PAC began running an ad in primary states featuring women reciting comments made by the billionaire that are derogatory toward women. That ad was produced by Our Principles, a group founded by a former Mitt Romney campaign adviser who is trying to help the GOP appeal to women.\n Trump has a substantial lead in the delegate chase for the GOP nomination. Cruz has a stiff challenge trying to catch him in remaining races and may only have a shot at the nomination if the contest spills into the summer convention.\n",

That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I know Hillary will be so good at it,\" the president said, in the video posted on Clinton's campaign site. \"In fact, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever been someone so qualified to hold this office.\"\n The president made clear he would no longer stand on the sidelines, even as Vermont Sen. Sanders vows to stick out the race at least through the final primary in Washington, D.C., next Tuesday.\n The Clinton campaign separately announced that she and Obama would campaign together June 15 in Green Bay. Clinton tweeted that she's \"fired up.\"\n Presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump immediately fired back.\n To which the Clinton campaign tweeted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Delete your account.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Meanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden voiced his support of Hillary Thursday evening at the American Constitution Society's national convention.\n \"Anybody who thinks that whoever the next president is -- and God willing, in my view, it will be Secretary Clinton.\"\n The White House, meanwhile, said Obama recorded the video on Tuesday, the day Clinton effectively wrapped up the nomination.\n The video was released shortly after Obama met in the Oval Office with Sanders.\n Sanders afterward struck a conciliatory tone Thursday, saying he plans to meet soon with Clinton to discuss how they can \u00e2\u20ac\u0153work together to defeat Donald Trump.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The Vermont senator said he still plans to compete in next Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Washington, D.C., primary, the final contest on the calendar. And he said he plans to take his message \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to the Democratic National Convention\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d in July.\n He did not, however, say specifically whether he would still be an active candidate by then, taking no questions from the press before heading over to a meeting with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid.\n The meeting with Obama was private. They met for over an hour, and Fox News is told no staff or aides were present.\n But his tone, compared with his defiant speech early Wednesday after Clinton clinched the Democratic nomination, appeared to soften.\n While offering no endorsement himself, Sanders said he spoke with Clinton and congratulated her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on her very strong campaign.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n And Sanders thanked Obama for his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153impartiality\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d throughout the process. He said he and Vice President Biden lived up to their pledge not to put their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thumb on the scales.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n White House spokesman Josh Earnest later said Sanders has the right to make campaign decisions on his own timeline. Another former primary candidate, ex-Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, did endorse Clinton, saying \"it is time now to unite our party.\"\n Clinton and Obama, along with other party leaders, are eager to bring Sanders \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and his supporters \u00e2\u20ac\u201c into the fold.\n The president's endorsement reflects their desire to unify as the general election battle between Clinton and presumptive rival Trump intensifies.\n Sanders acknowledged a common political enemy, railing against Trump in his brief remarks to reporters Thursday afternoon and saying he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do everything in his power to prevent Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election.\n As for what he wants, Sanders said he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll continue to fight what he called the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153drift\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d toward an oligarchic society. He lamented childhood poverty rates, crushing college debt, crumbling infrastructure and other woes and said these are the issues he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bring to the Philadelphia convention.\n Whether that means a fight to overhaul the party platform \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or a last-ditch bid to somehow deny Clinton the nomination \u00e2\u20ac\u201c remains to be seen.\n One demand Sanders was thought to be considering \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as part of a party-unity deal -- is the removal of Democratic boss Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Sanders and the DNC chairwoman have been at odds for months, with Sanders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 team long accusing her of helping now-presumptive nominee Clinton.\n Whether Sanders sought \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the president would even consider \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a Schultz sacrifice is unclear.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see how she makes it through the convention,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d one Democratic lawmaker told Fox News. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The key to Hillary winning is getting Sanders supporters on board.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Speculation over Wasserman Schultz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 position has swirled for months, however, and so far she has retained the public support of the White House. Obama also endorsed her earlier this year in her House primary battle.\n Asked Wednesday about the possibility of Sanders seeking her removal, Wasserman Schultz said she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not worried about her job.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I'm going to be remaining as the chair of the Democratic National Committee as President Obama has asked me to do until January 21, 2017, and I appreciate the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she said.\n",

But their efforts, which come after both chambers overwhelmingly passed the bill, are almost certain to be futile, and members of both parties have vowed to override the bill.\n Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader who plans to support the override effort, tried on Tuesday to play down any split between Democrats and Mr. Obama. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not against the president,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s against an idea, an interpretation of the bill.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Family members of the victims of the terrorist attacks have pushed for such a measure for years, and they have pressured members of Congress to move ahead with the legislation in the days leading up to the 15th anniversary of the attacks.\n The bill, which Saudi Arabia has fiercely opposed and has hired a phalanx of lobbyists to combat, addresses a 1976 law that gives other countries broad immunity from American lawsuits, amending it to allow for nations to be sued in federal courts if they are found to have played any role in terrorist attacks that killed Americans on home soil. The administration has argued that such a measure would put Americans at legal risk overseas from retaliating nations.\n",

Americans who want a great businessperson in the White House should look for someone who isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Trump, Bloomberg said.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Throughout his career, Trump has left behind a well-documented record of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits, angry stockholders and contractors who feel cheated and disillusioned customers who feel ripped off,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Bloomberg said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump says he wants to run the nation like he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s running his business? God help us.\n Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scathing speech seemed designed to chafe Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rawest nerves, mocking Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business prowess, his inheritance from his late father, his ego and his intellect.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Truth be told, the richest thing about Donald Trump is his hypocrisy,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Bloomberg said. Trump claims great wealth, but won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disclose his real net worth and refuses to release his tax returns. The real-estate developer also reacts defensively when his success is questioned.\n Bloomberg \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 who rivals Trump in unwavering self-assurance \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 favorably compared his own achievements in business and politics with Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard a lot of talk in this campaign about needing a leader who understands business. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree more. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve built a business \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t start it with a million-dollar check from my father,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Bloomberg said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Because of my success in the private sector, I had the chance to run America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest city for 12 years.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Bloomberg weighed an independent bid for president this year because he objected to both Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s primary challenger. Bloomberg was a vocal critic of the Republican candidate \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 his former friend \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 long before backing Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s White House run.\n The financial industry tycoon ridiculed Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statements on immigration, national security, foreign trade, and his use of overseas labor. And Bloomberg made dire predictions about the damage a Trump presidency would wreak on virtually every aspect of American life.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I understand the appeal of a businessman president,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Bloomberg said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business plan is a disaster in the making. He would make it harder for small businesses to compete, do great damage to our economy, threaten the retirement savings of millions of Americans, lead to greater debt and more unemployment, erode our influence around the world and make our communities less safe.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Trump on Tuesday assailed Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the Supreme Court for speaking out on the presidential race, calling her disdainful remarks about his candidacy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly inappropriate\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and suggesting that she owed other justices an apology.\n Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks came in a telephone interview with The Times two days after Justice Ginsburg was quoted as saying she was frightened about what the nation would look like if he were elected.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine what this place would be \u00e2\u20ac\u201d I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine what the country would be \u00e2\u20ac\u201d with Donald Trump as our president,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Justice Ginsburg told The Times in an interview published Sunday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be \u00e2\u20ac\u201d I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even want to contemplate that.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d She even joked ruefully about moving to New Zealand.\n Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, said he found those remarks unbefitting a member of the high court.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highly inappropriate that a United States Supreme Court judge gets involved in a political campaign, frankly,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Trump said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a disgrace to the court and I think she should apologize to the court. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe it when I saw it.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He continued: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That she should be saying that? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so beneath the court for her to be making statements like that. It only energizes my base even more. And I would hope that she would get off the court as soon as possible.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Trump also said he expected to announce his choice of a running mate by Friday, winding down a process that has been closely watched as in all likelihood the most significant decision he will make in his campaign.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have five candidates, plus two, two that are unknown to anybody,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Trump said from Chicago, where he was raising money for his campaign.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will be making a decision over the next three- to four-day period of time, and I think it will be a decision that will be a very good decision for a lot of people,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he added.\n Mr. Trump said that he was not basing his vice-presidential selection on fund-raising prowess or potential, and indicated that he had had enough experience with many of those he has been considering for the job that their tryouts on the campaign trail would not necessarily be determinative.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been with these people for a long time \u00e2\u20ac\u201d I know them,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Trump said, specifically invoking Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Christie was excellent yesterday and Newt is excellent.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Trump will appear on Tuesday night in Indiana with Gov. Mike Pence, who has risen in the estimation of many of the nominee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advisers.\n Mr. Trump said his decision was largely coming down to instinct. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of is gut. A lot of it is,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My whole life has been about gut.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He also suggested that he would consider polling in states like heavily Democratic Connecticut, which he again said he believed he could put in play in November.\n Asked for quick thoughts about each of the candidates he is known to be considering, Mr. Trump played along.\n Governor Christie? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Strong,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n Retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A patriot.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A terrific, exciting person.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Governor Pence? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Solid as a rock.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n And Mr. Gingrich? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Newt is Newt. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good guy.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack. We can't afford to be politically correct anymore.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Obama, speaking from the White House on Sunday, said the nightclub massacre in which 50 people were killed and at least 53 others were wounded is being investigated as an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153act of terror,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d though did not say whether it was tied to radical Islam.\n The gunman, Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, was heard shouting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Allahu Akbar\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d while engaging officers, law enforcement sources told Fox News.\n Mateen also called 911 during the shooting to pledge allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Fox News has learned.\n ISIS reportedly claimed responsibility for the attack, though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unclear if the shooting was actually directed by the group or only inspired by it.\n All these details, surrounding the deadliest terror attack on the U.S. homeland since 9/11, have fueled tensions in the presidential race at an already-combustible time.\n Trump has faced intense criticism from members of both parties for his calls to temporarily ban Muslim immigration to the U.S.\n In the wake of the Orlando attack, Trump again defended his proposals, saying on Twitter: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Trump originally was planning to deliver a speech Monday in Manchester, N.H., focused on the Clintons.\n In the wake of the Orlando attack, it will also focus on security and immigration issues, Fox News is told.\n Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders also condemned the attack, while speaking to reporters outside his home in Burlington, Vt.\n Earlier Sunday, Clinton released a statement unequivocally calling the massacre an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153act of terror.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For now, we can say for certain that we need to redouble our efforts to defend our country from threats at home and abroad. That means defeating international terror groups, working with allies and partners to go after them wherever they are, countering their attempts to recruit people here and everywhere, and hardening our defenses at home. It also means refusing to be intimidated and staying true to our values,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she said.\n She also called it an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153act of hate\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d -- a term Obama also used -- since the attacker targeted an LGBT nightclub during Pride Month. And she said the country needs to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153keep guns like the ones used last night out of the hands of terrorists or other violent criminals.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Clinton did not reference radical Islam.\n Meanwhile, a joint campaign rally with Clinton and Obama set for Wednesday in Green Bay, Wis., has been postponed in light of the attack, according to a White House official.\n Obama also ordered U.S. flags to be flown at half-staff \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as a mark of respect for the victims of the act of hatred and terror perpetrated on Sunday, June 12, 2016, in Orlando, Florida.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Florida GOP Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency, which will make additional resources available for local authorities.\n He offered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thoughts and prayers\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d to all those affected by the attack, particularly the victims and their families, and praised the efforts of the first-responders.\n",

We reject his message.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Trump tweeted Tuesday that he had accepted an invitation to meet Pe\u00c3\u00b1a Nieto in private. An invitation had also been extended to his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, but the former secretary of state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign said she was looking forward to speaking with him at the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153appropriate time.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Trump has spent more than a year railing against Mexico and its leaders, promising the country would pay for the construction of a wall on the border it shares with the U.S., as well as fear-mongering about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rapists\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and drug dealers that are coming across it.\n The surprise meeting abroad with a foreign leader will be Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first as a presidential nominee, and is not without risks to his candidacy. Mitt Romney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trip to Israel during the 2012 presidential campaign, for example, did not go over well. Pe\u00c3\u00b1a Nieto\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approval rating fell to a record low earlier this year amid several corruption scandals. He, too, may seize on the meeting as an opportunity to bolster his image with Mexicans.\n In his interview on CNN, Fox warned Pe\u00c3\u00b1a Nieto would be viewed like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a traitor\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d if he does not stand up to the GOP nominee.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump is using Mexico, using President Pe\u00c3\u00b1a to boost his sinking poll numbers,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Fox said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the President Pe\u00c3\u00b1a is taking an enormous political risk by hosting Trump. If he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gone soft on Trump, it will hurt him greatly. He will even be considered like a traitor because we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept to be offended like we just heard, and it should not happen. He comes here with a smile on his face. I think this is a big mistake on part of President Pe\u00c3\u00b1a.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very opportunistic move and I hope U.S. public opinion, U.S. citizens can see this and finally, and finally see what is behind Trump, this false prophet that is just cheating everybody,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a desperate move and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see how it can work at all.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Earlier this year, Fox railed against Trump in an expletive-laden outburst, promising that Mexico would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153never pay for that fucking wall.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d He later apologized, and even invited Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to come to Mexico and to learn about the real Mexico.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Trump noted so helpfully in a tweet Wednesday morning.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Former President Vicente Fox, who is railing against my visit to Mexico today, also invited me when he apologized for using the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153f bomb.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Fox tweeted his own recollection in response:\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153, I invited you to come and apologize to all Mexicans. Stop lying! Mexico is not yours to play with, show some respect.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

This followed a 97-1 vote hours earlier in the Senate.\n Despite last-ditch warnings from the Obama administration that the legislation could hurt national security and was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153badly misguided,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d lawmakers dismissed the concerns.\n \"This bill is about respecting the voices and rights of American victims,\" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said.\n Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., speaking on the Senate floor moments before Wednesday's vote in that chamber, pushed back hard on Saudi government objections to the legislation.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very simple. If the Saudis were culpable, they should be held accountable. If they had nothing to do with 9/11, they have nothing to fear,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Schumer said.\n Lawmakers in both chambers needed to muster a two-thirds majority to override, and did so easily. The lone \"no\" vote in the Senate was Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.\n With elections just over a month away, many lawmakers were reluctant to oppose a measure backed by 9/11 families who say they are still seeking justice 15 years after the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. A group of senators pledged to find ways to improve the measure during a post-election, lame-duck session of Congress.\n Despite an expectation that Congress would override, the White House made a last-ditch attempt to fight it. In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Reid, Obama warned the bill could cause chaos in U.S. foreign affairs, as other countries would use the measure to justify the creation of ways to target \"U.S. policies and activities that they oppose.\"\n \"As a result, our nation and its armed forces, State Department, intelligence officials and others may find themselves subject to lawsuits in foreign courts.\" Obama wrote in a letter delivered Tuesday.\n But Cornyn, one of the bill's leading proponents, dismissed Obama's concerns as \"unpersuasive.\" Cornyn, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, and other supporters said the bill is narrowly tailored and applies only to acts of terrorism that occur on U.S. soil.\n The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, moved to the floor of the Senate in May and passed by voice vote. The bill cleared the House earlier this month, also by voice vote.\n Defense Secretary Ash Carter, in a letter Monday to a senior member of Congress, said he's sympathetic to the intent of the measure. But the legislation could lead to the public disclosure of American secrets and even undercut counterterrorism efforts by sowing mistrust among U.S. partners and allies, according to Carter.\n With the override, the bill will now become law. During his nearly two full terms in office, Obama had never had a veto overridden by Congress.\n The legislation gives victims' families the right to sue in U.S. court for any role that elements of the Saudi government may have played in the 2001 attacks. Fifteen of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers were Saudi nationals.\n Courts would be permitted to waive a claim of foreign sovereign immunity when an act of terrorism occurs inside U.S. borders, according to the terms of the bill. Saudi Arabia has objected vehemently to the legislation.\n Obama vetoed the measure last week, telling lawmakers the bill would make the U.S. vulnerable to retaliatory litigation in foreign courts that could put U.S. troops in legal jeopardy.\n But the bill's proponents have disputed Obama's rationale as \"unconvincing and unsupportable,\" saying the measure is narrowly tailored and applies only to acts of terrorism that occur on U.S. soil.\n Kristen Breitweiser, a 9/11 widow and co-chair of September 11th Advocates, criticized Carter's assessment, saying that the defense secretary had testified before Congress last week that he wasn't an expert on the bill.\n",

Trump stirred up new controversy this week in the Republican presidential primary \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and new alarm among party leaders that the front-runner for the nomination will drive away women from candidates running farther down the ballot in the fall.\n All week, Mr. Trump has slowly escalated a war of words on Twitter against Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, his main competition in the Republican race, based on an ad by a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153super PAC\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d started by people who want to stop the New York developer from getting the nomination. The spot featured an old nude photo shoot of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wife Melania Trump, a former model, posing on his jet.\n Mr. Cruz has no affiliation with the super PAC, and he has denounced the ad. But Mr. Trump has continued to express disbelief. After threatening to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spill the beans\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d on Mr. Cruz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wife, Heidi Cruz, who suffered a bout of depression years ago, he retweeted a post from someone who made a side-by-side photo comparison of Mrs. Cruz at an unflattering angle, and Mrs. Trump.\n On Wednesday, Mr. Cruz repeatedly quoted from the movie \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The American President\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d to defend his wife, as she held an event and faced questions about Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threats. But that was before Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Twitter post with the pictures of the two women. And Mr. Cruz had finally had enough.\n Calling Mr. Trump a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sniveling coward,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Cruz told his rival to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153leave Heidi the hell alone.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s useful to remember the news media outrage in 2012 when Todd Akin, running as the Republican nominee for Senate in Missouri, defended what he called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153legitimate rape,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d a remark that was overwhelmingly offensive to women. Under pressure from news outlets, the Republican Party tried to cauterize the wound that Mr. Akin had created by isolating him.\n Spouses are generally seen as off limits. And the responses to Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments among news media critics, over time, have been far more subdued.\n",

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the result of some unusual alliances: Sen. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), who is on track to become the next Democratic leader, led the effort against the president alongside Sen. John Cornyn (Texas), a conservative member of Republican leadership.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is pretty much close to a miraculous occurrence,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Cornyn said before the vote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All of us have come together and agreed this is the appropriate and right thing to do.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n It takes two-thirds of the Senate to override a veto. Party leaders got well above that level. The final tally was 97-1. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) was the lone opposition. Two senators didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vote at all: Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who is Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vice presidential running mate, and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who was Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s runner-up in the presidential race.\n A Kaine spokesman later told HuffPost that the senator was traveling during the vote, but had he been there, he would have voted to sustain the veto. That puts him on the same page as Clinton, who has said she backs the bill.\n The House voted later on Wednesday to override the veto, causing the bill to become law.\n The bill, known as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, prevents Saudi Arabia and other countries with alleged ties to terrorist groups from invoking their legal immunity in U.S. courts. It overrides the 1976 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which grants immunity to countries that aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t designated state sponsors of terrorism.\n Fifteen of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 were Saudi citizens, but the Saudi government denies any role in the attacks and multiple U.S. government investigations have cleared it of blame.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I deeply respect the president and the reasons he has given for vetoing the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said ahead of the vote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But I urge my colleagues to move swiftly and soundly to reverse this veto so that these families can have their day in court.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The White House has fought against the bill for months, to no avail. Administration officials warn that it would put Americans overseas at legal risk and leave the United States vulnerable to bogus lawsuits \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 and hefty bills \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 in court systems around the world. The European Union and former top executive branch officials have urged Obama to stop it, in the name of protecting sovereign immunity. Saudi Arabia has threatened to retaliate by selling off hundreds of billions of dollars in American assets.\n But those arguments didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sway lawmakers, who say the White House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case is overblown. The bill originally passed the House and Senate without a single \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d vote.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The bill is near and dear to my heart as a New Yorker because it would allow the victims of 9/11 to pursue some small measure of justice,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Schumer said Wednesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Courts in New York have dismissed their claims against foreign entities alleged to have helped in the 9/11 attacks. They are following an incorrect reading of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Obama vetoed the bill last week and issued a lengthy statement with it. In sum, he said he sympathizes with 9/11 victims and has expanded efforts to help them, but that JASTA undermines \u00e2\u20ac\u0153core U.S. interests.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n White House press secretary Josh Earnest last week downplayed the significance of Obama getting such a strong rebuke from Congress, including from Democratic leaders.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The president is not particularly concerned about that,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Earnest said in his Friday briefing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This president has gone longer in his tenure in the White House than just about any other president in modern history before facing the prospect of having his veto overridden.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Trump in his speech at the Democratic National Convention this week \u00e2\u20ac\u201d labeling him a public menace and hinting that he was not quite sane \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it would be easy to think that the two billionaires had a rift going back many years.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump says he wants to run the nation like he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s run his business,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Bloomberg said on Wednesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153God help us.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But in all their time in New York City, their interactions have been limited, yet cordial, according to people who know both of them.\n They existed in different circles of New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultrarich: Mr. Bloomberg is known as a generous philanthropist; Mr. Trump appears to have been flinty in his giving. Mr. Bloomberg is a supporter of the arts and aligns himself with Manhattan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sophisticated cultural scene; Mr. Trump relishes in being crude.\n Mr. Bloomberg made his billions in finance and technology; Mr. Trump got his start in real estate before becoming a casino magnate and then a reality-show celebrity. Mr. Bloomberg is not overly ostentatious for a man of great wealth; Mr. Trump loves to show off his possessions.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been by Mike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s side for 19 years, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never met Donald Trump,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Kevin Sheekey, an adviser to Mr. Bloomberg, underscoring the extent to which the men were not close. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been part of the business, political or charitable community since the Koch administration. The only place Mike and Donald would have seen each other is on a golf course or on a TV set.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n On at least a few occasions, Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Trump met up on the golf links. In 2007, when Mr. Bloomberg was in the second of his three terms as mayor, the two played together in a charity event at Trump National Golf Club in the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s northern suburbs. An article in New York magazine described how Mr. Trump, Mr. Bloomberg, the comedian Billy Crystal and the former New York Yankees manager Joe Torre were set to play together in the lead foursome \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but could not agree on who would go first.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How about the mayor starts it off in honor of the city?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Trump was quoted as saying, playing peacemaker and showing deference to Mr. Bloomberg.\n Mr. Bloomberg also appeared twice on Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reality TV show, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Apprentice,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d in 2004 and 2008, in part as a way to demonstrate support for the show, which was produced in New York.\n And the men have a filial connection: acquaintances said that Mr. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daughter Georgina is friends with Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daughter Ivanka.\n Mr. Trump, an avid user of Twitter, made positive comments about Mr. Bloomberg when he was in office. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mike Bloomberg is doing a great job as mayor of New York City,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he posted in 2012.\n In 2013, he praised Mr. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration for choosing him to finish a stalled Bronx golf course project, and then wrote on Twitter about a ribbon-cutting with the mayor.\n In 2014, Mr. Trump tweeted congratulations at Georgina for winning an equestrian tournament.\n But the cordiality dissipated not long after Mr. Trump declared his candidacy. Mr. Bloomberg began exploring his own presidential bid, as an independent, in part to block Mr. Trump from being elected. And when Mr. Bloomberg ruled out running, he did so because he said he did not want his third-party candidacy to siphon enough votes to help Mr. Trump.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a former Republican presidential campaign manager told me, Hillary has some baggage, but Trump is crazy,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Mr. Sheekey, who was involved in Mr. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s explorative bid. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fix crazy.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Trump, typically, has not shied away from counterattacks. In a CNN interview in January, Mr. Trump voiced skepticism that Mr. Bloomberg was worth as much as Forbes magazine estimated and speculated that Mr. Bloomberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s company, which provides data terminals to financial firms and wealthy individuals, was vulnerable to competitors.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We used to be friends,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Trump told CNN. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I guess we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not friends anymore.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Paul LePage opened the door Tuesday to making an early exit from the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office following pressure from state lawmakers to step down.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m looking at all options,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d LePage said on talk radio station WVOM. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think some things I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been asked to do are beyond my ability. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to say that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to finish it. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not saying that I am going to finish it.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Later in the day, LePage took to Twitter, though, to push back on media reports about a possible resignation.\n During the radio interview, the governor apologized repeatedly for an expletive-ridden voicemail he recently left for Democratic state Rep. Drew Gattine -- the latest controversy to hang over his office.\n Earlier, the Republican governor had refused to apologize for the message, even saying at press conference he wished it was 1825 so he could shoot Gattine in a duel.\n In a recording of the message obtained by the Press Herald, the governor identified himself and went on to curse out Gattine.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would like to talk to you about your comments about my being a racist, you c---sucker. I want to talk to you I want you to prove that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a racist. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve spent my life helping black people and you little son-of-a-b----, socialist c---sucker. You \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I need you to, just friggin. I want you to record this and make it public because I am after you. Thank you,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said in the message.\n LePage initially said his outburst was justified because Gattine called him a racist \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something Gattine has denied.\n The alleged name-calling came after LePage said during a town hall that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collected a binder full of drug dealers arrested in the state showing that 90 percent of them \u00e2\u20ac\u0153are black and Hispanic people from Waterbury, Conn.; the Bronx; and Brooklyn.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The leaked voicemail prompted members of LePage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own party to question his ability to lead the state.\n During his news conference Friday, LePage offered more racially charged comments that have drawn fire, saying, \"A bad guy is a bad guy. I don't care what color it is. When you go to war ... you try to identify the enemy. The enemy right now, the overwhelming majority of people coming in, are people of color or people of Hispanic origin.\"\n But this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the first time LePage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments have gotten him in trouble.\n The Republican governor has a long history of making controversial statements dating back to 2010 when he said if he were elected governor, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d tell President Obama to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153go to hell.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n A year later, LePage said that NAACP officials, who had called him out for not attending a Martin Luther King Jr.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s event, could \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kiss my butt.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In 2015, LePage was forced to apologize to the son of a cartoonist for The Bangor Daily News because he told him he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153like to shoot\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d his father. That same year, a charter school said LePage threatened to strip it of its funding if it did not rescind a job offer to Democratic state House Speaker Mark Eves.\n In January, he said drug dealers with names like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153D-Money, Smoothie (and) Shifty\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d are getting Maine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s white women pregnant. He later said he had misspoke and meant to say all \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Maine women\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d not only \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Maine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s white women.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n LePage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second and final term as governor officially ends in 2019.\n",

An elementary classroom. A church. A military base. A movie theater. And, now, a gay nightclub. Mr. Obama said Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s massacre, by a gunman with a handgun and an assault weapon, is another brutal reminder of how easy it is for someone to slaughter dozens.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have to decide if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the kind of country we want to be,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Obama said on Sunday as he mourned the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deadliest mass shooting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And to actively do nothing is a decision, as well.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Obama vowed to respond forcefully to what he called a devastating \u00e2\u20ac\u0153act of terror and an act of hate.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d This time, it was a tragedy that combined gun violence, a hatred of gays and ties to Islamist terrorism.\n In his remarks, Mr. Obama said it was still unclear to the authorities whether there was a direct link between the gunman and international terrorist groups. But in the hours after he spoke, law enforcement officials said that the gunman had pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State, and they acknowledged that he had twice been investigated for terrorism connections.\n It took only hours for questions about those connections to become fodder in the presidential campaign. Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, seized on the attacks as evidence of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weakness in facing terrorism. He demanded that Mr. Obama resign because he refused to say the words \u00e2\u20ac\u0153radical Islam\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d in his remarks.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we do not get tough and smart real fast, we are not going to have a country anymore,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Trump said in a statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Because our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and it is only going to get worse. I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, called the massacre in Orlando, Fla., an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153act of terror\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153act of hate\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and called for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hardening our defenses at home\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d while \u00e2\u20ac\u0153refusing to be intimidated and staying true to our values\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d in the United States.\n Mr. Obama pleaded with Americans during his remarks not to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153give in to fear or turn against each other,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d a somewhat muted reference to Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s previous call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Obama said. Rather than giving in to fear, the president said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we will stand united, as Americans, to protect our people, and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Speaking to reporters, Mr. Obama said the country had again been traumatized by grievous violence, which shattered more than 100 lives during a three-hour nightmare early Sunday, with 50 people killed and 53 wounded in the attack.\n During his presidency, Mr. Obama has repeatedly mourned victims of mass shootings, often expressing anger and frustration at what he has said is the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apparent willingness to let them become a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153normal\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d part of life.\n That anger has been compounded by Mr. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inability to persuade lawmakers to impose new restrictions on the availability of firearms, especially the assault-style rifles like the one believed to have been used by the gunman in Sunday morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack in Orlando. A major push for a ban on assault weapons after the 2012 massacre of schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn., ended in failure.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Can we say that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re truly doing enough to give all the children of this country the chance they deserve to live out their lives in happiness and with purpose?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d an emotional Mr. Obama said after the Newtown attack.\n Mr. Obama on Sunday gave his deepest condolences to the families of the victims, and he said Americans should, in particular, keep the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gay and lesbian community in mind as they offer their prayers. He called it an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153especially heartbreaking day\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d for the gay community.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends, to dance and to sing, and to live,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Obama said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The place where they were attacked is more than a nightclub \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it is a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds and to advocate for their civil rights.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Obama has often hailed the progress on gay rights that has been made during his presidency, especially the decision by the United States Supreme Court to allow same-sex marriage. But those legal protections have not erased hatred in the country.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American \u00e2\u20ac\u201d regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation \u00e2\u20ac\u201d is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n Mr. Obama took no questions from reporters after delivering his five-minute remarks. He turned from the podium to walk back into the West Wing, once again left to monitor the investigation, prepare a likely eulogy for the dead and wonder when he might have to come into the briefing room again.\n Shortly after he spoke, Mr. Obama ordered that flags at the White House and other federal sites around the world be lowered to half-staff. Again.\n",

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Friday lashed out at Donald Trump, accusing the billionaire of enlisting \"his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen to do his bidding.\"\n The tabloid published a story earlier this week claiming that Cruz had extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz vehemently denied the rumors, which rippled through the Washington media establishment on Friday.\n \"I want to be crystal clear: these attacks are garbage,\" Cruz said Friday in a statement posted on Facebook.\n Earlier in the day, the allegations spilled over into an almost surreal exchange on CNN between Cruz's former communications director Amanda Carpenter and Boston Herald columnist Adriana Cohen, in which Cohen accused Carpenter of having an affair with Cruz. \"You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been named as well, Amanda,\" Cohen said, referring to the National Enquirer piece.\n Trump responded to Cruz's allegations in a statement on Friday afternoon:\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have no idea whether or not the cover story about Ted Cruz in this week's issue of the National Enquirer is true or not, but I had absolutely nothing to do with it, did not know about it, and have not, as yet, read it. I have nothing to do with the National Enquirer and unlike Lyin' Ted Cruz I do not surround myself with political hacks and henchman (sic) and then pretend total innocence.\n Ted Cruz's problem with the National Enquirer is his and his alone, and while they were right about O.J. Simpson, John Edwards, and many others, I certainly hope they are not right about Lyin' Ted Cruz.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n While the Enquirer has an infamous reputation for tabloid journalism, it has also broken a number of major sex scandals over the years, including the extramarital affairs of former Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.) and golfer Tiger Woods.\n Reached for comment, a spokesman for American Media Inc., the Enquirer's parent company, also denied that the story had been influenced by Trump backers.\n \"No one influences the reporting that The National Enquirer does other than our own reporters and editors. We stand by the integrity of our coverage and remain committed to our aggressive reporting on such an important topic,\" a spokesman said.\n",

Mueller III, the special counsel appointed to lead an inquiry into Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s influence on the 2016 election and possible ties to Trump associates.\n As he left for Utah on Monday, the president said he felt \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very badly\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d for Mr. Flynn, whom he fired in February for lying to the vice president about the content of these conversations.\n Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments Monday on Mr. Flynn come at a time when the special counsel investigation is focusing intensely on the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inner circle. Mr. Trump once encouraged Mr. Flynn to seek an immunity deal. Presidents typically do not weigh in on federal investigations to avoid appearing to influence the outcome.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel badly for General Flynn,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Trump said on Monday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel very badly. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s led a very strong life and I feel very badly. Hillary Clinton lied many times to the F.B.I. Nothing happened to her. Flynn lied and they destroyed his life.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Trump did not cite specifically what Mrs. Clinton said that he considered a lie.\n Mrs. Clinton gave a voluntary interview to the bureau in July 2016 during its investigation into whether she or her aides broke the law by corresponding through a private email server set up for her use as secretary of state. A few days later, the F.B.I. director at the time, James B. Comey, recommended no charges be filed against her in the matter.\n",

Will update soon with Secretary Zinke. Thank you!\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, said in a statement later Friday night that the decision applied to two African countries, though it did not name them.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153President Trump and I have talked, and both believe that conservation and healthy herds are critical,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the statement said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a result, in a manner compliant with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, the issuing of permits is being put on hold as the decision is being removed.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The United States Fish and Wildlife Service had signaled its intention to end the 2014 ban, citing Zimbabwe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conservation efforts. On Thursday, the service announced on its website that it would begin issuing permits to allow the import of elephants hunted from 2016 to 2018, with two trophies allowed per import.\n Nearly two weeks ago, the department also waived the ban in a similar manner for Zambia.\n Zambia and Zimbabwe have had mixed success in recent years maintaining or increasing their elephant population, according to the Great Elephant Census, a project financed by Paul G. Allen, a founder of Microsoft. The project also found that the African elephant population shrunk nearly 30 percent from 2007 to 2014.\n It is unclear why Mr. Trump reversed the decision, but the announcement faced backlash from both conservatives and liberals. Laura Ingraham, a Fox News host, said Thursday on Twitter that she did not understand how the decision would not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153INCREASE the gruesome poaching of elephants,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d while the comedian Ellen DeGeneres started an online campaign, using the hashtag #BeKindToElephants, to raise funds for elephant conservation efforts.\n On social media, photos were being shared of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two elder sons hunting on safari in Zimbabwe, including one photo that showed Donald Trump Jr. with a severed elephant tail in one hand and a knife in the other.\n The White House argued that the hunting would bring money to local communities and incentivize efforts to protect elephants. In defending the decision on Friday, Ms. Sanders cited a recently completed Park Service review that had begun during the Obama administration.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This review established that both Zambia and Zimbabwe had met new standards, strict international conservation standards that allowed Americans to resume hunting in those countries,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she told reporters during a news briefing.\n Under President Barack Obama, the practice had been banned because of a lack of data on conservation efforts in Zimbabwe.\n Safari Club International, a trophy-hunting organization that sued the Obama administration in 2014 in an effort to challenge the ban and was the first to report the policy change on Tuesday, lashed out against the news media and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anti-hunters\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d for swaying the Trump administration to lift the trophy ban.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fight for the freedom to hunt is far from over,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Paul Babaz, the organization\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, said in a statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will be more proactive and not back down.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But environmental groups applauded the reversal on Friday and called for more restrictions on trophy hunting, which has faced increased scrutiny, especially after an American dentist killed Cecil, a lion beloved in Zimbabwe, in 2015.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great that public outrage has forced Trump to reconsider this despicable decision,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Tanya Sanerib, a senior lawyer with the Center for Biological Diversity, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but it takes more than a tweet to stop trophy hunters from slaughtering elephants and lions.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Ms. Sanders also confirmed Friday that a near-total ban on the commercial trade of African elephant ivory enforced during the Obama administration would remain in place.\n",

Director, Trump Says\n\nPUBLISHED: 2017/05/18\n\nPresident Trump, 24 hours from his self-imposed deadline for picking a new F.B.I. director, told reporters on Thursday that he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very close\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d to choosing a successor to James B. Comey, and he named Joseph I. Lieberman, the former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, as a finalist.\n But members of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff \u00e2\u20ac\u201d alarmed by his rapid embrace of Mr. Lieberman, a charming 75-year-old political operator with no federal law enforcement experience \u00e2\u20ac\u201d have quietly urged him to take more time to make such a critical hire. By late Thursday, the president appeared increasingly likely to leave Friday for a nine-day foreign trip without picking a new director, according to three senior administration officials speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n Mr. Lieberman, who served three terms in the Senate as a Democrat and one as an independent, would be an atypical choice to lead the F.B.I., whose agents prize the bureau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence as one of Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s few apolitical institutions. Judges and former prosecutors, not elected officials, have frequently been chosen.\n Administration officials described the search as fluid and said the president and his team were keeping the decision-making process closely held to avoid the leaks that Mr. Trump believes are endemic to the West Wing.\n Still, Mr. Trump, speaking briefly with reporters in the Oval Office as he met with President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia, offered an emphatic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153yes\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d when asked whether Mr. Lieberman was among the finalists.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need a great director of the F.B.I. I cherish the F.B.I. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s special,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he told reporters later at a joint East Room news conference with Mr. Santos. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All over the world, no matter where you go, the F.B.I. is special. The F.B.I. has not had that special reputation with what happened in the campaign, what happened with respect to the Clinton campaign, and even, you could say \u00e2\u20ac\u201d directly or indirectly \u00e2\u20ac\u201d with respect to the much more successful Trump campaign.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n It was unclear whether the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s acknowledgment that Mr. Lieberman was a finalist was intended to stoke the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Apprentice\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d-style frenzy of speculation he has favored with other high-profile picks, only to opt for a lesser-known candidate.\n Mr. Trump is still seeking applicants, and some aides, along with many law enforcement officials, have suggested that he hire from within the agency to repair some of the damage to morale wrought by Mr. Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sudden firing. Adam S. Lee, the well-regarded special agent in charge of the bureau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Richmond, Va., field office, was interviewed, as were Richard A. McFeely, a former senior official at the F.B.I., and Andrew G. McCabe, the acting director.\n Mr. McCabe, a veteran agent who joined the bureau in 1996 and once specialized in Russian organized crime, was named deputy director in 2016. It is not clear whether he will return to that role once Mr. Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacement is confirmed.\n All three men are under consideration, the administration officials said, even if Mr. Lieberman, who was Al Gore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s running mate in the 2000 presidential campaign, is the front-runner.\n Mr. Trump and Mr. Lieberman had good chemistry when they met privately, one White House aide said \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a key ingredient for Mr. Trump in hiring people. He is also friendly with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former senator, who has told Trump aides that Mr. Lieberman would most likely receive overwhelming support in the Senate.\n Democrats pushed back hard on that notion, casting the conservative Mr. Lieberman as a Democrat in name only and noting that he publicly supported Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick of Michael T. Flynn as his first national security adviser. At a closed-door Democratic lunch on Thursday, Senators Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois urged party members to hold the line if he is selected.\n But casting Mr. Lieberman as the most likely choice did have one immediate advantage: It appealed to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who had suggested this week that the firestorm over Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ouster of Mr. Comey was as bad as Watergate. Mr. McCain defended Mr. Lieberman, who endorsed his 2008 run for president.\n The White House remains divided, and several senior officials expressed serious doubts about Mr. Lieberman. His age, 75, could be problematic, they said, given that F.B.I. directors serve 10-year terms. And he is employed by one of the firms where Marc E. Kasowitz, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, works, raising the prospect of conflict-of-interest accusations.\n If Mr. Trump picks Mr. Lieberman, one adviser said he might serve for a short stint \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to lend his bipartisan reputation to a president badly in needed of credibility \u00e2\u20ac\u201d instead of the full term. Mr. Lieberman also has law enforcement experience as the former attorney general of Connecticut.\n Others on Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s list are former Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma and former Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan, both Republicans. Mr. Rogers, a former F.B.I. agent, was endorsed by the agents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 association.\n Also interviewed were two other judges, Michael J. Garcia of the New York State Court of Appeals and Henry E. Hudson of Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.\n",

Ed Royce on Friday questioned the action because of concerns not only about African wildlife but U.S. national security, citing the political upheaval in Zimbabwe, where the longtime president was placed under house arrest this week by the military.\n \"The administration should withdraw this decision until Zimbabwe stabilizes,\" the committee chairman said in a statement. \"Elephants and other big game in Africa are blood currency for terrorist organizations, and they are being killed at an alarming rate. Stopping poaching isn't just about saving the world's most majestic animals for the future \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it's about our national security.\"\n Royce said that when carefully regulated, conservation hunts could help the wildlife population, but \"that said, this is the wrong move at the wrong time.\"\n The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said in a written notice issued Thursday that permitting elephants from Zimbabwe and Zambia to be brought back as trophies will raise money for conservation programs. The change marks a shift in efforts to stop the importation of elephant tusks and hides, overriding a 2014 ban imposed by the Obama administration. The newly announced policy applies to the remains of African elephants killed between January 2016 and December 2018.\n \"Legal, well-regulated sport hunting as part of a sound management program can benefit certain species by providing incentives to local communities to conserve those species and by putting much-needed revenue back into conservation,\" the agency said in a statement.\n The illicit demand for elephant ivory has led to devastating losses from illegal poaching as the natural habitat available for the animals to roam has also dwindled by more than half. As a result, the number of African elephants has shrunk from about 5 million a century ago to about 400,000 remaining. And that number continues to decline each year.\n Two other lawmakers, Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., and Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., co-chairs of the Congressional Animal Protection Caucus, assailed the administration's decision.\n",

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., both called Tuesday for a postponement on any vote to confirm Gorsuch to the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highest court.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is unseemly to be moving forward so fast on confirming a Supreme Court justice with a lifetime appointment while this big gray cloud of an FBI investigation hangs over the presidency,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Schumer said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can bet if the shoe were on the other foot and a Democratic president was under investigation by the FBI the Republicans would be howling at the moon about filling a Supreme Court seat in such circumstances.\"\n Warren added on Twitter: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Neil Gorsuch is up for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court from a President whose campaign is under FBI investigation.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Republicans panned the call as \"ridiculous.\" But Democrats could still try and filibuster, requiring Gorsuch to garner 60 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153yea\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d votes in the Senate. That's a high bar for Republicans, who have just 52 members in the Senate.\n That's where the so-called \"nuclear option\" comes in. If majority Republicans change the threshold, Gorsuch could be approved with a simple majority of 51 votes.\n The nuclear option was first used by Democrats for circuit court judicial appointments in 2013 and top Republicans \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including President Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have indicated for weeks it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a serious option in order to get Gorsuch on the court.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we end up with that gridlock, I would say, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIf you can, Mitch, go nuclear,'\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Trump said Feb. 1.\n Republican Senate leaders so far have refrained from using the term \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but their exasperated rhetoric shows they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at least kicking the tires of a legislative Enola Gay.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If Judge Gorsuch can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t achieve 60 votes in the Senate, could any judge appointed by a Republican president be approved with 60 or more votes in the Senate?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., asked on Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find Gorsuch acceptable, are they taking the position the vacancy should never be filled? At all?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n McConnell hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tipped his hand on strategy; however, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s maintained in interviews that, one way or another, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the nominee will be confirmed.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., meanwhile, lamented the increasing politicization of Supreme Court nominations and implored his Democratic colleagues to vote on the man \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not the party of the president who nominated him.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what I hope \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that we turn around and go back to where we were, because what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing is going to destroy the judiciary over time,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Graham said on Monday.\n Supreme Court justices have faced more pushback from the opposition party in recent years. Antonin Scalia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whom Gorsuch would replace on the court following Scalia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death in 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was confirmed 98-0 and Anthony Kennedy had a tally of 97-0 in 1988. But the contentious Clarence Thomas hearing in 1991 produced a 52-48 split that just pushed Thomas over the finish line. Ruth Bader Ginsburg was confirmed 96-3 two years later and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153yea\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d votes have largely dwindled ever since: Stephen Breyer, 87; John Roberts, 78; Samuel Alito, 58; Sonia Sotomayor, 68; Elena Kagan, 63.\n",

Moore, after a report that he had made sexual advances toward four teenage girls when he was in his 30s.\n The Washington Post reported that, in early 1979, Mr. Moore, then a district attorney and later the chief justice of the state Supreme Court, had approached a 14-year-old, eventually kissing her, undressing her, touching her over her bra and underpants, and guiding her hand to touch him over his underwear.\n The paper found three other women who said they had been pursued by Mr. Moore around the same time, when they were between 16 and 18 years old. The Post interviewed more than 30 people in reporting its account.\n Mr. Moore told The Post that the allegations were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and the Washington Post on this campaign.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d He is set to face Doug Jones, a Democrat, in a special election next month.\n The story was met with immediate backlash from Republicans in Alabama, several of whom dismissed the women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stories out of hand. Some called the article a partisan plot, even as the reporters behind it described in detail how they had uncovered the story and corroborated the allegations. Here are some of the officials\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 responses.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTotal contrived media garbage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\n That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how John Skipper, 66, a former chairman of the Mobile County Republican Party, characterized the claims, speaking to The New York Times.\n He said that he and other Alabama Republicans would continue to support their candidate and echoed Mr. Moore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assertion that the Democratic Party had been behind the story.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most of them will not be shocked,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and will rather be expecting these shenanigans being pulled by the Democrats as standard operating procedure.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Alabama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state auditor, Jim Ziegler, told The Washington Examiner that the women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claims were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153much ado about nothing\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and said that Mr. Moore had done nothing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immoral or illegal.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d (Alabama law, both in 1979 and now, finds that someone who is 19 or older and has sexual contact with someone between the ages of 12 and 16 is guilty of second-degree sex abuse.)\n Mr. Ziegler sought to justify Mr. Moore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions by comparing him to the biblical Joseph, saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter. They became parents of Jesus.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If they believe this man is predatory, they are guilty of allowing him to exist for 40 years,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think someone should prosecute and go after them. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a victim 40 years later, in my opinion.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Daniel Dale, a reporter for The Toronto Star, contacted multiple Republican officials in the state and kept a running report of their responses to the story.\n Jerry Pow, the party chairman for Bibb County, told Mr. Dale that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d back Mr. Moore even if the candidate had committed a sex crime.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would vote for Judge Moore because I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to vote for Doug,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not saying I support what he did.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Others, including the party chairmen for Covington County, William Blocker, and Mobile County, John Skipper, dismissed the story as a Democratic trick. Mr. Blocker said that he would not change his mind even if there was proof that Mr. Moore was guilty.\n Riley Seibenhener, the party chairman in Geneva County, told Mr. Dale that if the allegations were true, he would not support the candidate. But he also said that Mr. Moore was not guilty of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forcible rape.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I know that 14-year-olds dont\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make good decisions,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n",

He outlined a dark vision of an America afflicted by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the ravages\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d of economic dislocation and foreign exploitation, requiring his can-do approach to turn around.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Trump told hundreds of thousands of rain-soaked admirers and onlookers in a forceful 16-minute Inaugural Address from the West Front of the Capitol. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ascension amounted to a hostile takeover of a capital facing its most significant disruption in generations. While officially a Republican, he has taken on leaders of both parties and, with no prior political career of his own, made clear that he saw himself as the ultimate outsider not beholden to the current system.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining but never doing anything about it,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action. Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view of the United States was strikingly grim for an Inaugural Address \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a country where mothers and children are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trapped in poverty in our inner cities,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d where \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rusted-out factories\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scattered like tombstones across the landscape\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and where drugs and crime \u00e2\u20ac\u0153have stolen too many lives.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This American carnage,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he declared, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stops right here and stops right now.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He got started right away with rolling back the policies of his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, by issuing orders freezing new regulations from recent weeks and ordering agencies to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ease the burden\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d of the Affordable Care Act during the transition from repealing to replacing the law. More orders are planned for next week.\n Wearing a dark suit and red tie and accompanied by his wife, Melania, in a powder-blue suit and matching gloves, Mr. Trump took the 35-word oath administered by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. precisely at noon. Michael Richard Pence, a former governor and congressman from Indiana, was sworn in minutes before as vice president by Justice Clarence Thomas.\n Mr. Trump assumed the presidency of a country still unsettled after a polarizing election and entered office with less support in polls than any other president in recent history. It was clear from the day that there would be no grace period either for or by the new president. The Senate confirmed two cabinet nominations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d James N. Mattis as defense secretary and John F. Kelly as secretary of homeland security \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but Democrats temporarily held up Mike Pompeo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation as C.I.A. director.\n Throughout the day, there were mostly peaceful protests against the new president. Sporadic violence broke out as demonstrators smashed shop windows and burned a limousine, while police officers in riot helmets responded with tear gas. More than 200 people were arrested. Liberal groups prepared for a women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s march on Saturday that they said could draw hundreds of thousands.\n Mr. Trump made only passing efforts to reach out to Democrats beyond thanking Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, for their handling of the transition. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They have been magnificent,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said in his speech.\n He later praised his defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton, at a lobster-and-beef luncheon with congressional leaders, asking her and former President Bill Clinton to stand for applause. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have a lot of respect for these two people,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n Democrats were not impressed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was pretty shocked by how dark it was,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Inaugural Address. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I love this country, and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand how a president of the United States that loves his country could paint a picture of its failures.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He added, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was interesting sitting up onstage with a bunch of billionaires hearing him say how bad the country was.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The National Mall was filled with supporters, many wearing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Make America Great Again\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d hats and chanting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump! Trump! Trump!\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d But the lingering animosity from the presidential campaign was on display, too. When Mrs. Clinton arrived, some in the crowd chanted, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lock her up,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d mimicking Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign rallies. As he took the oath, a cluster of people blew whistles and screamed, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not my president,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d before being escorted out.\n While large, the crowds on a soggy day did not rival the energetic throngs at Mr. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first inauguration eight years ago, according to aerial photographs. The Washington Metrorail system recorded fewer than half as many rides on Friday morning as in 2009, and knots of bystanders along the inaugural parade route were not as thick. In a city that gave just 4 percent of its vote to Mr. Trump, many residents left town and about 60 House Democrats boycotted the event.\n Mr. Obama made his exit after the ceremony, flying by helicopter to Joint Base Andrews in the Maryland suburbs, where he thanked former aides and members of his administration before boarding the presidential jet, no longer designated Air Force One, to fly to Palm Springs, Calif., for vacation. He will return to Washington to a rental house while his daughter Sasha finishes high school, the first president to stay in the capital since Woodrow Wilson.\n Hours before his departure, Mr. Obama posted on Twitter to thank followers and hint that he would not fade away. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by your voices of truth and justice, good humor, and love.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his wife, Jill, rode an Amtrak train to Delaware and the home they have there. But they, too, planned to return, at least part time, to Washington, where Mrs. Biden teaches at a community college in the Virginia suburbs.\n The United States has never seen a president quite like Mr. Trump, the son and grandson of immigrants who grew up to become a real estate magnate, casino owner, beauty pageant operator and reality television star whose tumultuous love life played out in the tabloids.\n Never has the oath been administered to a president who had never served either in public office or as a general in the military. At age 70, Mr. Trump became the oldest president sworn in for the first time and the first born in New York since Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n He was also one of the wealthiest presidents ever to enter the White House, with far-reaching business connections that have already raised questions about where his interests end and the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s begin. He arrived in the Oval Office dogged by reports about Russian interference in the election on his behalf.\n But Mr. Trump overcame skeptics when he embarked on what seemed like a quixotic bid for the presidency. An Ivy League-educated mogul who lives in a New York tower named after himself with an 80-foot-long living room, he transformed himself into the unlikely leader of a working-class movement anchored in rural areas far removed from the coasts.\n His bracing candor, disregard for convention and willingness to offend whole sections of the population to make a point came across as refreshing truth-telling to many Americans disenchanted with Washington elites.\n For the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 58th inauguration, though, the untraditional president opted to follow tradition. He and Mrs. Trump, a former model from Slovenia who became the first foreign-born first lady since John Quincy Adams\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wife, Louisa, started the day with a service at St. John\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Episcopal Church adjacent to Lafayette Square, then joined the Obamas, Bidens and Pences for coffee at the White House.\n From there, the two presidents shared a limousine to the Capitol, where three other presidents waited: Mr. Clinton, Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush, all of whom opposed Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. Former President George Bush remained hospitalized in Houston, recovering from pneumonia, but a spokesman said he watched the ceremony on television.\n Mr. Pence, 57, was sworn in at 11:54 a.m., placing his hand on Ronald Reagan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bible, which was held by his wife, Karen, as their three adult children, Michael, Charlotte and Audrey, watched.\n For his oath, Mr. Trump placed his hand on two Bibles held by his wife, one given him by his mother in 1955 just before his ninth birthday and another used by Abraham Lincoln in 1861 and again by Mr. Obama in 2009 and 2013.\n Standing nearby were his adult children from two previous marriages, Donald Jr., Eric, Ivanka and Tiffany. Also there was Barron, his 10-year-old son with the first lady. Joining them was Ivanka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s husband, Jared Kushner, who will serve as an unpaid senior adviser.\n As Mr. Trump approached the podium, rain began to fall. It was not a conventionally Republican speech, with nothing about tax cuts or restraining government. Instead, he laid out a protectionist agenda, saying his rule will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153buy American and hire American.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d He did pledge to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153eradicate from the face of the Earth\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Islamic terrorism. Responding to charges that he demonized Mexicans and Muslims, Mr. Trump said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no room for prejudice.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Trump said the inauguration was not merely the transfer of power from one president to another. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For too long,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he continued, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a small group in our nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished but the people did not share in the wealth.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d He added, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That all changes starting right here and right now.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Now lets just hope she stays out of jail,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d a representative for Shields told HuffPost.\n In other (and considerably less gory) photos shot by Shields, Griffin poses by the pool in a revealing leather getup as a man holding a camera stands above her.\n According to New York Magazine writer Yashar Ali, Griffin claims that the image is an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153expression of art\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d inspired by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about former Fox News correspondent Megyn Kelly having \u00e2\u20ac\u0153blood coming out of her eyes\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of her \u00e2\u20ac\u201d wherever.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n After news of the photo shoot broke, Griffin took to Twitter to explain her motivations behind the image and reiterate that she does not condone violence in any way. She does, however, condone \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mocking the Mocker in Chief.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n UPDATE - May 30, 10 p.m.: Kathy Griffin issued a formal apology for the controversial images on Twitter.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I went way too far,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she said in a video on the social media site.\n UPDATE - May 30, 5:20 p.m.: Hours after Kathy Griffin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s photo shoot with a fake bloody Donald Trump head made the internet rounds, the official Twitter account for the U.S. Secret Service has issued a statement.\n A Secret Service representative confirmed to HuffPost that the following tweets were in direct response to the controversial image.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On it! @SecretService has a robust protective intelligence division that monitors open source reporting & social media to evaluate threats,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the tweets read. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Threats made against @SecretService protectees receive the highest priority of all of our investigations,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d with the hashtag #ProtectionNeverRests.\n",

Joe Lieberman.\n Lieberman, 75, who served in the Senate from 1989-2013, first as a Democrat and then as an independent, met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday afternoon to discuss leading the law enforcement agency. A late and somewhat unlikely addition to Trump's short list, Lieberman is nonetheless the sudden frontrunner.\n When asked point-blank by a reporter in the Oval Office Thursday if Lieberman was the leading contender, Trump replied, \"Yes.\"\n Trump also met Wednesday with current acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating and FBI official Richard McFeely.\n Lieberman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s law enforcement experience stems from his two-term tenure as Connecticut\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorney general, spanning from 1983 until his resignation in 1989 when he was elected to the U.S. Senate.\n Lieberman, who ran as vice president on Al Gore's 2000 ticket, became an independent after losing the Democratic primary in 2006. He won re-election, and two years later further angered Democrats when he endorsed John McCain for president against eventual winner Barack Obama, even speaking at the Republican National Convention.\n Lieberman told Fox Business Network last year that he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153never changed parties\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and in fact ended up endorsing Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential campaign against Trump.\n Some Republican senators called the idea of Lieberman replacing Comey \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intriguing,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d but Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mistake\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d to nominate him.\n \"Lieberman is probably the only person who can get 100 votes in the Senate,\" Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, said on Capitol Hill on Thursday after the closed Senate briefing with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Cornyn was on the White House's shortlist to replace Comey, but withdrew himself from consideration this week.\n On Thursday morning on the Senate floor, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., argued against a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153career politician\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d of either party to lead the FBI, though he did not name Lieberman.\n",

He remains in critical condition, but has improved in the last 24 hours. The Congressman will require additional operations, and will be in the hospital for some time.\"\n Scalise, R-La., like other members of leadership, is assigned a full-time security detail from U.S. Capitol Police, who guard him in Washington and at home in his district. His detail was credited with putting down the attacker and saving lives.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If Scalise was not there, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the one with security detail, we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have had any protection and God knows how bad that might have been,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Rep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, told \"Fox & Friends.\"\n Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., acknowledged the incident has sparked new security questions for members without assigned police protection at events outside Capitol Hill.\n He, along with several other members of Congress, suggested the most critical change may be to boost security for large lawmaker gatherings, even informal ones like the baseball practice in Alexandria, Va.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We already had concerns and we have great law enforcement at home, first responders do a great job, but this makes you anticipate every event now in a new way,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Brat said on Fox News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s News HQ\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d on Wednesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Forty guys get together at the same time, that would be a major security event normally, but I think we got a little excited and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think things through as well as we could have.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Brat said lawmakers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153may need to recalibrate public events,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d while also suggesting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tighter security\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d at town halls -- which most congressional lawmakers have scheduled through the summer recess. This year's town halls to date have been particularly rowdy and tense, prompting lawmaker concerns long before Wednesday's attack.\n The Wednesday attack injured Scalise; Matt Mika, a lobbyist for Tyson Foods; Zack Barth, a staffer from Texas Rep. Roger Williams\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 office; and two U.S. Capitol Police officers, Special Agents Crystal Griner and David Bailey.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Without Capitol Hill police, it would have been a massacre\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe had no defense\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe had no defense at all,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said on \"Fox & Friends.\" \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were like sitting ducks.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Lawmakers have appealed for more security before, including after the 2011 shooting of then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. A detail for every lawmaker is likely not possible -- and security already is provided for major events and lawmakers facing a specific threat.\n But there are broad questions at hand in boosting security beyond that: particularly, does it hurt democracy to put an added barrier between lawmakers and constituents?\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I bet most members of Congress would say they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want [a] security detail\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI sure don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Pa., manager of the Democratic congressional baseball team, told reporters.\n Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich lauded the current system where lawmakers interact with the people on a regular basis in settings like grocery stores. He said the threat of the \"occasional deranged person\" should not change that.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We start surrounding these folks with layers of guards\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit will really cripple the ability to be a free society,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Outnumbered.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Gingrich added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are a free country, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re gonna run the risk of freedom.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Rep. Williams backed Gingrich's comments in a press conference on Capitol Hill Wednesday. Rogers was injured during the attack when he dove into the dugout \u00e2\u20ac\u0153like a pool without water.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But Williams suggested he would feel \u00e2\u20ac\u0153safer\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d if he were allowed to carry a gun on Capitol Hill, reminding reporters that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a big Second Amendment guy\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d -- and said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we probably ought to take a look at our security in big groups like that.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Doyle, too, suggested that could be the solution: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in an area with 30 or 40 members, where anyone can walk through, we need to re-think that\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut I think most members would tell you they feel fine and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not looking for any security.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Rep. Thomas Massie, R-K.Y., took calls for additional security a step further on Thursday by re-introducing legislation that would allow those who have concealed carry permits in their home states to carry in Washington D.C.\n U.S. Capitol Police have not announced any increased security measures for congressional lawmakers, but said they will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continue to provide a robust and visible presence\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d around the Capitol.\n James Norton, who was deputy assistant secretary at Department of Homeland Security under the George W. Bush administration, told Fox News that staffing each member of Congress with a personal security detail would cost billions and acknowledged the unwillingness of some members to have additional layers of security. But he said they need to consider \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the dangers\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d that come with public forums.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You have to consider that there is a lot of information for the public\u00e2\u20ac\u201dobviously members want to give as much information as they can\u00e2\u20ac\u201da lot of calendars are broadcast, social media, information is readily available,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Norton said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But there are a lot of bad actors out there looking to do harm, and vigilance needs to be taken by each member and their staff.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Brooke Singman is a Reporter for Fox News.

Our children and grandchildren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s futures are on the line. So rest assured \u00e2\u20ac\u201d I will NEVER GIVE UP the fight!\"\n The Post story centered on allegations made by Leigh Corfman, now 53. She told the newspaper that Moore, then an assistant district attorney, first approached her in 1979 outside a courtroom in Alabama where she was sitting with her mother. On another occasion, she said Moore, then 32, took her to his home in the woods and kissed her.\n During a subsequent visit, Corfman reportedly claimed he took off her shirt and pants; touched her over her bra and underwear; and guided her hand to his underwear. She said the two did not have sexual intercourse, and that she ended up getting dressed and asking Moore to take her home, according to the Post.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wanted it over with \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I wanted out,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she told the Post, apparently recalling her train of thought at the time. Moore did take her home, she said.\n The report caused immediate problems for Moore with his own party as he heads into the Dec. 12 election against Democrat Doug Jones. Several GOP senators called on him to step aside if the allegations are true \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and at least one senator, Arizona\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s John McCain, said he should drop out regardless.\n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who backed Moore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rival Luther Strange in the GOP primary, said in a statement: \"If these allegations are true, he must step aside.\"\n Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., head of the Senate GOP campaign arm, called the allegations \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply troubling\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If these allegations are found to be true, Roy Moore must drop out of the Alabama special Senate election.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Jones\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 campaign told multiple news outlets: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Roy Moore needs to answer these serious charges.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But Moore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign issued a statement saying the report is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153baseless\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and false.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153National liberal organizations know their chosen candidate Doug Jones is in a death spiral, and this is their last ditch Hail Mary,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Moore campaign chairman Bill Armistead said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Judge Roy Moore is winning with a double-digit lead. So it is no surprise, with just over four weeks remaining, in a race for the U.S. Senate with national implications, that the Democratic Party and the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most liberal newspaper would come up with a fabrication of this kind.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This garbage is the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n The Post noted that the legal age of consent in the state is 16, and sexual contact by anyone 19 or older with anyone between 12 and 16 years old is considered second-degree sexual abuse.\n The statute of limitations, though, has long since passed.\n The Post interviewed three other women who were teenagers at the time who claimed Moore pursued them when he was in his 30s, though he did not force them into any type of sexual relationship.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have prayed over this,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Corfman told the Post as to why she came forward, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All I know is that I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sit back and let this continue, let him continue without the mask being removed.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Alabama's Republican governor, Kay Ivey, responded: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These allegations are deeply disturbing. I will hold judgment until we know the facts. The people of Alabama deserve to know the truth and will make their own decisions.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

The messages were given to congressional investigators probing whether Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential campaign colluded with Russian officials to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. (Federal officials believe WikiLeaks published material, including emails from the Democratic National Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s servers, that had been obtained via Russian hackers.)\n Trump Jr. later on Monday confirmed his correspondence with WikiLeaks, posting several screenshots of the Twitter messages.\n The messages are mostly from WikiLeaks to the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son, but Trump Jr. did occasionally respond to the messages. The organization made multiple requests of Trump Jr., asking him to provide his father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax returns and suggesting the candidate refuse to concede if he lost the election to Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. (Trump Jr. didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t respond to either message.)\n On one occasion, Trump Jr. tweeted a link to a cache of leaked emails after the WikiLeaks account messaged it to him.\n On another, WikiLeaks wrote it was happy to see the elder Trump mentioning the group on the campaign trail. Moments later, Trump tweeted about the organization.\n After Trump won the election, Wikileaks suggested that Trump should prod Australia to appoint the site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder, Julian Assange, ambassador to the United States.\n The White House didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment on the report. In a statement to The Atlantic, Trump Jr.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorney, Alan Futerfas, said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Vice President Mike Pence, who in an Oct. 14, 2016, interview with Fox News claimed the campaign had not been in contact with WikiLeaks, said in a statement late Monday that he had not known about Trump Jr.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s messages.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The vice president was never aware of anyone associated with the campaign being in contact with WikiLeaks,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Pence press secretary Alyssa Farah. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He first learned of this news from a published report earlier tonight.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Weeks before the election, asked if the campaign was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in cahoots\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d with WikiLeaks, Pence denied it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nothing could be further from the truth,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think all of us have, you know, have had concerns about WikiLeaks over the years, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a reality of American life today, and of life in the wider world.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Trump Jr. became embroiled in the Russia investigation after it was revealed he and other campaign officials met with a Kremlin-backed attorney in June 2016 who had promised damaging information about Clinton. Leaked emails published by The New York Times show Trump Jr. arranged the meeting at Trump Tower in New York.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To the extent they had information concerning the fitness, character or qualifications of a presidential candidate, I believed that I should at least hear them out,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Trump Jr. said in a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee, one of the congressional committees probing the campaign\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Russia ties, in September.\n He said the meeting did not lead to anything, and has denied colluding with the Russian government.\n Trump Jr. is expected to publicly testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, according to the panel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California.\n",

Flynn,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Trump told reporters before leaving for a trip to Utah, saying that Flynn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ruined.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Trump then pivoted to Clinton, apparently referring to the FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation into her use of a private email server.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hillary Clinton lied many times to the FBI, and nothing happened to her. Flynn lied, and it destroyed his life, and I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a shame,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Trump said, before again claiming that Clinton \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lied many times, [and] nothing happened to her. Flynn lied, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like, it ruined his life. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very unfair.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The president this morning says 'I feel badly for General Flynn.' #MorningJoe pic.twitter.com/tBp5aXWhBj \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) December 4, 2017\n Flynn pleaded guilty on Friday for lying to the FBI in special counsel Robert Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation into possible collusion between Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign and Russia, becoming the first former administration official to face charges in the probe.\n Trump and the White House have long claimed that the investigations into the campaign have nothing to do with Trump himself. Flynn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indictment, however, makes it increasingly difficult for the president to distance himself.\n Flynn stepped down in February, saying that he had misled the transition team, including then Vice President-elect Mike Pence, about the extent of his contacts with Russian officials, which included discussing sanctions and the creation of a backchannel with the Kremlin.\n Trump and his lawyer, John Dowd, now claim that the president already knew about Flynn lying to the FBI, renewing questions of whether Trump obstructed justice in the investigation.\n In May, Trump told NBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lester Holt that he fired then-FBI Director James Comey with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this Russia thing\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d in mind. The following month, Comey testified before the Senate that Trump had requested that Comey put an end to the agency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation into Flynn.\n In an interview with Axios published Monday, Dowd brought out a new defense: Trump isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t guilty of obstructing justice because he is the president.\n The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153President cannot obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer under [the Constitution\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Article II] and has every right to express his view of any case,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Dowd said.\n",

He claimed that a 2005 tape of him bragging about sexual assault, which was released last fall, was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153locker room talk.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In September, Moore, a controversial judge in Alabama, won the primary for the special election. He beat GOP establishment candidate Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.), who was chosen to fill the seat left vacant when Jeff Sessions became Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorney general.\n Trump notably backed Strange over Moore, though many members of his base, including former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, supported Moore.\n But after Moore won, Trump disavowed his endorsement of Strange, deleting tweets in support of him. And the day after the primary, the president tweeted in support of Moore, calling him \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a really great guy.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

How ironic!\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The Atlantic first reported on Monday that Trump Jr. received a private message from the WikiLeaks Twitter account on September 20, 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a message shown in the tweets produced by the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A PAC run anti-Trump site putintrump.org is about to launch,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d WikiLeaks wrote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The PAC is a recycled pro-Iraq war PAC. We have guessed the password. It is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcputintrump.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 See \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAbout\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for who is behind it. Any comments?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Trump Jr. replied, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Off the record I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know who that is, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll ask around. Thanks.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In a separate October 2016 exchange, WikiLeaks urged Trump Jr. to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153comment on/push this story\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d about then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton wanting to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just drone\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Julian Assange, the Wikileaks founder.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Already did that earlier today,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Trump Jr. later replied. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s amazing what she can get away with.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The messages obtained by The Atlantic were turned over to investigators by Trump Jr.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorneys. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence had access to the documents, a source told Fox News.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Over the last several months, we have worked cooperatively with each of the committees and have voluntarily turned over thousands of documents in response to their requests,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Alan Futerfas, an attorney for Trump Jr., said in a statement.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Putting aside the question as to why or by whom such documents, provided to Congress under promises of confidentiality, have been selectively leaked, we can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n According to the report, the messages are part of a long correspondence between WikiLeaks and Trump Jr., though Trump Jr. seemed to ignore many of the messages, including some which urged him to release \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one or more of your father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax returns.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorney Ty Cobb told Fox News on Monday that he was not aware that Donald Trump Jr.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorneys provided these documents to congressional investigators, but said there is likely no legal issue, from what he knows of the documents.\n Wikileaks publisher Julian Assange tweeted about the report on Monday, saying that the organization couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u0153confirm\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the messages with Trump Jr.\n Wikileaks \u00e2\u20ac\u0153does not keep such records and the Atlantic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presentation is edited and clearly does not have the full context,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Assange wrote.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153WikiLeaks loves its pending publications and ignores those who ask for details,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Assange continued. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump Jr. was rebuffed just like Cambridge Analytica. In both cases WikiLeaks had publicly teased the publications. Thousands of people asked about them. WikiLeaks can be very effective at convincing even high profile people that it is their interest to promote links to its publications.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153WikiLeaks has such chutzpah that it allegedly tried to convince Trump Jr to leak his father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax returns & his own \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Russian lawyer meeting\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d emails (he did),\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Assange wrote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153WikiLeaks appears to beguile some people into transparency by convincing them that it is in their interest.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Assange also claimed that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153full text of alleged DMs with context provides a different reading, unsurprisingly.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n This is not the first time that Trump Jr. has been in the spotlight, and has had his actions brought into question amid the larger probe into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in the 2016 presidential election.\n In June 2016, Trump Jr. accepted a now-highly scrutinized meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, after he allegedly was promised \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dirt\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d on Hillary Clinton. The meeting was brokered by music publicist Rob Goldstone who promised the campaign information. Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, who was charged last month in Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probe into Russian collusion, also attended the meeting.\n Fox News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Matt Richardson and John Roberts contributed to this report.\n",

He adding that the issue has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153under study for years\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d but that he would provide an update after additional review.\n Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said in a statement on Twitter that he and Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153believe that conservation & healthy herds are critical.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n As HuffPost reported Wednesday, the administration optedto lift the 2014 ban after determining that sport hunting of elephants in those African countries would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enhance the survival of the species in the wild,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d a spokesperson for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said. It also recently rolled back protections for African lions, releasing new guidelines that allow big game hunters to bring back to the U.S. animal trophies from hunts in parts of Africa.\n The decision regarding elephants was made public not by the federal agency but via a celebratory news release early Tuesday from Safari Club International, a trophy hunting advocacy group that, along with the National Rifle Association, sued to block the 2014 ban. Greg Sheehan, principal deputy director of the FWS, broke the news to the hunting organization during the African Wildlife Consultative Forum in Tanzania, an agency spokesperson told HuffPost. The forum, which ended Friday, was hosted by the Safari Club International Foundation and the United Republic of Tanzania.\n The Safari Club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political action committees donated a collective $24,500 to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential campaign and Zinke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2014 and 2016 congressional campaigns, according to Federal Election Commission data. Zinke is a former Montana congressman and Navy SEAL.\n Conservation groups celebrated Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sudden change in course Friday, which was believed to be a response to public pressure.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great that public outrage has forced Trump to reconsider this despicable decision, but it takes more than a tweet to stop trophy hunters from slaughtering elephants and lions,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Tanya Sanerib, senior attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need immediate federal action to reverse these policies and protect these amazing animals.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In a post to Twitter, Wayne Pacelle, the CEO of The Humane Society of the United States, said he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grateful\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d that Trump would reconsider. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is the kind of trade we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The elephant trophy decision drew national headlines and a fierce response from celebrities and others across social media. Talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres launched a campaign called #BeKindToElephants. By lifting the ban, she said, Trump was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153encouraging Americans to kill elephants.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n A day after Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suspension, the Safari Club sent out a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153call to arms,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d encouraging hunters to contact Trump and Zinke and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tell them how much you appreciate the efforts of the Fish & Wildlife Service to remove barriers to sustainable use conservation for African wildlife.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d And they blasted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hysterical anti-hunters and news media outlets.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The news from Africa could not have been better for hunters or for anyone who loves or defends hunting culture,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the group wrote.\n African elephants have been listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act since 1978. A provision of the law, however, allows for sport-hunted trophies to be imported if the government determines that hunting will help safeguard the population.\n The FWS concluded that Zimbabwe has made strides to improve elephant management and anti-poaching efforts, according to a notice published Friday in the Federal Register.\n Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was among the many people who called on Trump to abandon his trophy hunting decision. In a Friday statement, Royce pointed to the unrest in Zimbabwe \u00e2\u20ac\u201d where a military coup is thought to be unfolding \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and said he has no confidence that the regime is properly managing conservation programs.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Elephants and other big game in Africa are blood currency for terrorist organizations, and they are being killed at an alarming rate,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Royce said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stopping poaching isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just about saving the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most majestic animals for the future \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about our national security.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Hours before Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s review announcement, the FWS defended its decision as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153part of a robust United States conservation strategy that seeks to eliminate poaching and associated wildlife trafficking.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Nominees have, in turn, generally refused to answer any question directly, in an appparent fear of revealing any bias about a potential future case they may hear.\n The four days of Senate Judiciary Committee hearings held this past week for President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nominee to fill the late Justice Antonin Scalia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seat, Judge Neil Gorsuch, were different. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee took a different tack. They made an argument against the Supreme Court itself and its false presentation as a body above politics and power. That judges do not, as Chief Justice John Roberts once famously said, only call \u00e2\u20ac\u0153balls and strikes.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n At the base of this argument was a simple question that has been dogging Democrats ever since the infamous Bush v. Gore decision on the 2000 presidential election: Is the Supreme Court rigged to benefit corporations, the wealthy and, well, Republicans?\n Pressing this question did not knock Gorsuch off his steady stream of non-answers. The polished Gorsuch certainly did not make any deluded or deranged statements, as many have come to expect from the president, that could lead a Republican to flip on his nomination. The Democrats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 argument was instead directed at both their base and their caucus to provide a clear rationale for opposing the nominee \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 no matter his qualifications.\n Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) made this point abundantly clear when he pointed to the series of 5-4 decisions made under Roberts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leadership that have changed laws to help Republicans get elected, big donors gain more influence in politics through campaign contributions and corporations gain more economic and political power.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think these 5-4 decisions are a problem, you said sometimes \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 I think I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m quoting you correctly \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 sometimes big corporations can capture an agency,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Whitehouse said to Gorsuch. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a well known principle of administrative law and of economics. Just let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s be sure that our Supreme Court doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to be one of those agencies that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s captured on any subject.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n On this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s episode of The Huffington Post\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So That Happened\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d podcast, 2016 Democratic House candidate Zephyr Teachout, a constitutional law professor at Fordham University School of Law, said the Democrats took the right approach by aiming their fire at the court as an institution that shapes our economy and our politics.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I thought both Whitehouse and others rightly pointed out that after Roberts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 confirmation we gotta pull away that fake story that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just calling balls and strikes,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Teachout said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know, and we know and have seen, that the Supreme Court reshapes power in our country.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Gorsuch, who worked on former President George W. Bush\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2004 reelection campaign and as a lawyer in his Justice Department, provided the expected performance past court nominees had given during his appearance; he stated that he would be shocked by politics coming into a courtroom. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m distressed to hear you think that judges of the Supreme Court is an organ of a party,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Gorsuch told Whitehouse.\n It is no surprise that Democrats find little need to take this opinion seriously anymore. Former President Barack Obama had nominated Judge Merrick Garland to fill Scalia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seat practically one year to the date before Gorsuch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confirmation hearing. Senate Republicans refused to hold public hearings for Garland and declined to meet with him in private. Gorsuch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nomination represents the fruit of the Republicans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision to block Garland.\n Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt.) called this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an extraordinary blockade.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was totally unprecedented in our country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s whole history,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some likened it to the action of the tyrannical kings who claim that they have sole control, as one of our senators referred to here a few minutes ago.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Responding to Gorsuch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stated belief that justices have no partisan leanings, Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) explained, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And you know, you said earlier, there are no Democratic judges, there are no Republican judges. If that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the case, what was Merrick Garland about? That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what it was about.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In addition, Democrats are still irritated at Roberts for promising to call only \u00e2\u20ac\u0153balls and strikes\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d in his 2005 confirmation hearing. Instead, he went on to anchor the five vote conservative majority\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions in controversial cases. These included Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which opened the door to unlimited corporate spending in politics; Shelby County v. Holder, which overturned a key section of the voting rights act; and numerous pro-corporate decisions limiting the rights of citizens to challenge corporations in courts, reducing the ability of states to protect patient and privacy and allowing mutual funds to lie to investors.\n Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) blasted Roberts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision in Shelby County for creating a whole new constitutional doctrine out of whole cloth, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So, so much for judicial modesty,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So much for balls and strikes. So much for judges judge best when they judge least, which you mentioned tonight as a virtue.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The Roberts Court has done much to reshape power in the United States. The five vote conservative majority that included Scalia has sided with corporations and corporate lobby groups more than any other Supreme Court majority in recent history.\n After Gorsuch repeatedly stated that there was ample room for Congress to legislate without worrying about court decisions, Democrats reminded him of how the court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions play a key role in shaping who is elected to Congress and, therefore, what bills can be passed in the first place.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[B]y tilting the political playing field so heavily toward corporations and against individuals, hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the court impacted the composition of who is in Congress and made it therefore even harder for Congress to taking meaningful,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Hirono said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Meaningful action to say past laws to protect worker safety or the access of students with special needs to an education?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Whitehouse asked about the court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s controversial Citizens United decision, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What could be more involved in politics than to open this ocean of dark money that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flooded into our politics?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Democrats on the committee appeared frustrated that Gorsuch refused to acknowledge the court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in transforming both the political and economic worlds the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s citizens operate in. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told Politico that Gorsuch \u00e2\u20ac\u0153did not win anybody over with his testimony.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Schumer added that he believed he had the 41 votes necessary to filibuster the nomination.\n",

Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, wore a shirt from Louisiana State University, Mr. Scalise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alma mater.\n When a video message from President Trump played on the big screen, some of the Democrats in the crowd booed, but less lustily than usual.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You are showing the world that we will not be intimidated,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Trump said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The game will go on.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Some members of Congress had not expected to stay behind for the annual showdown, with families and district business waiting for them.\n But by nightfall, the decision was clear.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We come here, and these members become our family,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, said at the Capitol before a game he had not intended to see.\n He spoke of 1968 and of the political violence he had seen up close as a civil rights leader, invoking Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy.\n Mr. Lewis, now 77, stared straight ahead for a moment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have to stay,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said softly.\n All day, before as more than 24,000 ticket holders filed in for the charity game, the shorthand for other tragedies ricocheted through the Capitol.\n At work on Thursday, those pangs visited lawmakers like a too-familiar houseguest \u00e2\u20ac\u201d stalking them down the Capitol\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corridors, past the Senate chamber where a ferocious health care debate had already resumed, along the hall where some had stood one day earlier as survivors, still in dusted cleats and uniforms, unharmed but unsettled.\n The reaction would be different this time, some said. More sustainable. It had to be. Probably. Maybe. Right?\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the half-life?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d asked Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi, appraising how long the comity might last. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The skepticism is near-universal. Even one day out from the initial anguish, much of the political ecosystem seemed unchanged.\n In a Thursday morning tweet, Mr. Trump railed against the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153WITCH HUNT\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d of investigations of his associates. Elected officials accused one another of hypocrisy and selective memory on matters of policy, perhaps a bit more gently than they might have on a typical weekday.\n Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said he was warming up with Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, who is not known for bipartisan spirit.\n And Ms. Pelosi could not resist suggesting that Republicans were the initiators of the present rancor.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Somewhere in the \u00e2\u20ac\u212290s, Republicans decided on a politics of personal destruction as they went after the Clintons,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she told reporters earlier on Thursday.\n Moments later, she added, a bit regretfully: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I really am almost sad for myself that I have gone down this path with you, because I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appropriate for us to have the fullest discussion of it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be for another day.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But for an optimist in the city \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and there still seem to be a few \u00e2\u20ac\u201d there were flourishes to appreciate.\n House interns hauled signs: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Scalise Strong,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Capitol Police MVP\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unvidvided\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d in red, white, and blue.\n Another attendee delivered this message, held aloft: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This Democrat is here to support Congressman Scalise. Get well soon, sir.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic whip, resolved to wear a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Team Scalise\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d shirt to the game. Ms. Pelosi sat for an interview alongside Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin. The Senate leaders \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, and Mr. Schumer of New York \u00e2\u20ac\u201d did the same.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dislike each other,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. McConnell said, deploying a rare complimentary double negative.\n Among those on the field before the game was Representative Roger Williams, Republican of Texas, whose aide Zachary Barth was shot at the practice. Mr. Williams, a coach on the team, trudged out on crutches after injuring his foot in the Wednesday morning fray as well.\n David Bailey, a Capitol Police officer who was wounded while helping to stop the attack, threw out the ceremonial first pitch. (The ball was delivered to the mound, in an apparent bit of sponsorship oddity, by a Budweiser Clydesdale.)\n Mr. Scalise remained in the hospital on Thursday after a second surgery for internal injuries and a broken leg. Doctors said his condition was critical but improving. He received a standing ovation when he was introduced as a team member, with Democrats waving their caps at his image on the screen beyond the outfield fence.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Maybe with a little more time, the teams would be mixed,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d suggested Representative Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But at least for now, the healthy competition will bring us together.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Several elements of the evening did diverge sharply from the ballpark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standard, professional fare \u00e2\u20ac\u201d commonplace for a congressional game that has, since 1909, produced a steady torrent of middling baseball, worse trash talk and more than occasional injury.\n By the concessions, attendees discussed field director salaries and legislative wrangling. Khakis filled the grounds. A cutout of the head of Representative Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio, was held high.\n Chants of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We love you, Pelosi!\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d rang out briefly, until the minority leader acknowledged them.\n Supporters from both parties raised hot dogs and beers, catching up on acquaintances in common.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just one day removed, so it still feels different, I think,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said before the game, recalling past tragedies that many swore would reshape the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politics. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I hope it lasts.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n At the practice on Wednesday, Mr. Flake had raced to Mr. Scalise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s side to provide water and first aid after the shooting stopped.\n He set out a goal for himself and his colleagues, uttered before inside the Capitol. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tone down our own rhetoric and not ascribe the worst motives to our colleagues,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said hopefully. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That can be done.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n For an evening, at least, Washington delivered.\n A little before 10 p.m., the Democrats secured their final out for an 11-2 victory, taking a 40-to-39 edge in the lifetime series. As the players shook hands, the team managers \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Representative Mike Doyle, Democrat of Pennsylvania, and Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas \u00e2\u20ac\u201d gathered for closing ceremonies.\n Mr. Doyle did not hold the trophy for long.\n It was going to Mr. Scalise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office, they decided, until he gets back.\n",

Trump took the oath of office Friday to become the 45th president of the United States.\n Chief Justice John Roberts administered the 38-word oath at 12:00 p.m., capping Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unlikely journey from New York City real estate developer and reality TV star to the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highest office.\n Trump won the Republican nomination against a crowded field of 16 other candidates, many far more experienced in politics.

In September, Mr. Trump acknowledged in a closed-door interview with the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had corresponded with the group during the campaign, the officials said.\n The correspondence, which began weeks before the Nov. 8, 2016, election and continued through much of this year, is the second time it has been publicly revealed that Mr. Trump communicated with people and organizations with ties to the Russian government who were trying to undermine the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.\n In July, The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump met with Russians in June 2016 who said they had damaging information on Mrs. Clinton, and that the information was part of the Russian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support for Mr. Trump.\n Mr. Trump on Monday night releasedseveralscreen shots of his messages with WikiLeaks. His lawyer, Alan S. Futerfas, said the documents were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153selectively leaked\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d among the thousands that have been turned over to congressional investigators.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Futerfas said in a statement.\n By publishing thousands of hacked emails, American intelligence agencies believe WikiLeaks was acting as a conduit for Russian operatives.\n The Twitter messages were first reported by The Atlantic, which published copies of the correspondence.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hiya, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be great if you guys could comment on/push this story,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d WikiLeaks said in a message to Mr. Trump on Oct. 3, 2016, that included a quote from Mrs. Clinton in which she said she wanted to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just drone\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Already did that earlier today,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Trump said in response. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s amazing what she can get away with.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In a message a week later, WikiLeaks asked Mr. Trump to have his father tweet a link to a site where users could search through hacked emails from Democrats.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s many great stories the press are missing and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sure some of your follows will find it,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d WikiLeaks said, adding that the group had just released more emails stolen from Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta.\n Mr. Trump did not respond. Fifteen minutes later, however, his father tweeted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Very little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks. So dishonest! Rigged system!\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Assange said on Twitter that he could not confirm whether the group had corresponded with Mr. Trump.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153WikiLeaks loves its pending publications and ignores those who ask for details,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Assange said, adding that thousands of people had asked the group about the emails it had published.\n Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the messages, if real, are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one more example of Russians, Russian agents \u00e2\u20ac\u201d in this case WikiLeaks \u00e2\u20ac\u201d reaching out to senior officials in the Trump Organization or Trump campaign.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The last message Mr. Trump received from WikiLeaks was in July, shortly after The Times reported that he had corresponded with the Russians promising \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dirt\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d on Mrs. Clinton.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hi Don. Sorry to hear about your problems,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d WikiLeaks said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have an idea that may help a little. We are VERY interested in confidentially obtaining and publishing a copy of the email(s) cited in the New York Times today.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Shortly thereafter, Mr. Trump released the emails himself.\n",

Flynn, President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first national security adviser, the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior Democrat said on Wednesday, escalating Mr. Flynn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s troubles with Congress.\n The Democrat, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, said Mr. Flynn had declined the panel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s request for documents and an interview as part of its investigation into Russian meddling in last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those subpoenas will be designed to maximize our chance of getting the information that we need,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Schiff told reporters during a breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And I think we need to use whatever compulsory methods are necessary to get the information that he possesses.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Schiff said he hoped the committee would issue the subpoenas this week, before Congress leaves for a one-week recess. It was unclear whether the subpoenas would seek documents or Mr. Flynn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony, or both.\n The subpoenas could not be issued without at least some support from Republicans, who make up the majority of the committee. A spokeswoman for Representative K. Michael Conaway of Texas, the Republican leading the investigation, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Conaway has repeatedly refused to comment on the details of the investigation while it is continuing.\n The announcement was made mere hours after the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee issued subpoenas Tuesday afternoon to Mr. Flynn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two firms, seeking information that could shed light on his lobbying work on behalf of Turkish interests last year, among other connections.\n On Monday, Mr. Flynn, in a letter from his legal team, rejected a subpoena for documents from the Senate committee, citing the Fifth Amendment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protections against self-incrimination. He also declined the Senate committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invitation for an interview.\n Mr. Flynn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rejection of the subpoena put him at risk of being held in contempt of Congress, a rarely invoked process that, should lawmakers choose to pursue it, could result in a criminal citation.\n The Flynn Intel Group was paid more than $500,000 to represent Turkey in a dispute with the United States government while Mr. Flynn was advising the Trump campaign. He belatedly registered as a foreign agent for that work after being forced out of the Trump administration for misrepresenting his communications with the Russian ambassador to Vice President Mike Pence.\n Mr. Flynn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legal troubles have only mounted in recent days. On Monday, it was revealed that he had misled Pentagon investigators about his foreign contacts and sources of income while seeking a renewed security clearance in February 2016. Among the payments he did not disclose was a $45,000 fee from a Russian state-backed news organization for a speech he gave in Moscow two months before. During that trip, he was photographed at a gala sitting next to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.\n Lying to federal officials is a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison.\n As recently as Monday, in his letter to the Senate committee, Mr. Flynn has reiterated his offer to testify in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the committee, has dismissed that option.\n",

The video touched off a storm of protests from people on all sides of the political spectrum, which forced Ms. Griffin to apologize, and CNN announced that it would fire her from the annual New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve program she has co-hosted.\n In a statement later in the day, the first lady, Melania Trump, questioned Ms. Griffin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sanity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The Trumps had the support of the daughter of the woman the president beat in last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election, among others.\n Ms. Griffin went online on Tuesday night to express regret. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I sincerely apologize,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she said in a video. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just now seeing the reaction of these images. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a comic. I crossed the line. I move the line, I cross it. I went way too far. The image is too disturbing. I understand how it offends people. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t funny. I get it.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n She said she had asked the photographer to pull the images. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I beg for your forgiveness,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she continued. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I went too far. I made a mistake and I was wrong.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d She did not address Mr. Trump specifically in her video.\n CNN, which has enlisted Ms. Griffin to host New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve programming alongside Anderson Cooper for the last decade, announced on Wednesday that she would no longer appear.\n Mr. Cooper distanced himself, as well.\n Mr. Trump also lashed out at Democrats in Congress whom he accused of trying to squelch testimony involving the investigation into Russian meddling in last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election. Shortly after a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fox and Friends\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d segment reporting that Democrats no longer want to hear testimony from Carter Page, a onetime Trump campaign adviser, Mr. Trump wrote that it was all part of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153witch hunt\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d against him.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So now it is reported that the Democrats, who have excoriated Carter Page about Russia, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want him to testify,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he wrote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He blows away their case against him & now wants to clear his name by showing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe false or misleading testimony by James Comey, John Brennan \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Witch Hunt!\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In a letter to the House Intelligence Committee reported by Fox and other news organizations, Mr. Page wrote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have learned from your Committee staff on this Memorial Day holiday that I might not be immediately afforded the opportunity to address the false or misleading testimony by James Comey, John Brennan, et al. as per our previously scheduled appointment for next week. In the interest of finally providing the American people with some accurate information at long last, I hope that we can proceed with this straight dialogue soon.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Page did not list what testimony he considered false by Mr. Comey, who was fired by Mr. Trump as director of the F.B.I., or Mr. Brennan, the former director of the C.I.A., who stepped down when President Barack Obama left office in January. But Mr. Page urged the committee \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to investigate the growing evidence of collusion between Clinton campaign associates, Comey and other former Obama administration officials.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

The assailant, who authorities have identified as 66-year-old James T. Hodgkinson of Belleville, Illinois, was shot by police and later died of his injuries at a hospital.\n Scalise underwent surgery at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center after being shot in the hip. In a statement Wednesday night, the hospital said Scalise sustained \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a single rifle shot to the left hip\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153travelled across his pelvis, fracturing bones, injuring internal organs and causing severe bleeding.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He underwent immediate surgery and an additional procedure to stop bleeding,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the hospital said, noting the congressman had received multiple blood transfusions and remained in critical condition late Wednesday. It said Scalise would need further operations.\n Before the surgery, Scalise was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in good spirits and spoke to his wife by phone,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d his office said. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump on Wednesday night visited Scalise in the hospital, bringing flowers and offering support to the lawmaker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family.\n The Trumps also met with Crystal Griner, one of the two U.S. Capitol Police officers injured in the attack, and her wife. Griner and David Bailey, the other officer hurt, are in stable condition, according to Chief Matthew R. Verderosa.\n Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence also checked in on Scalise and Griner on Thursday.\n Zachary Barth, a staffer for Rep. Roger Williams (R-Texas), was shot in the leg. He was transported to a local hospital and has since been released. Williams sustained a minor leg injury.\n Matt Mika, director of government relations for Tyson Foods\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Washington, D.C., office, was also among those shot. His condition was upgraded from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153critical\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d on Thursday, a spokeswoman for George Washington University Hospital confirmed to HuffPost.\n The attack took place shortly after 7 a.m. at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park, less than 8 miles south of the White House. U.S. Capitol Police officers assigned to Scalise engaged Hodgkinson in gunfire, and Alexandria Police responded soon after. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At that point, we were able to calm the situation, and victims were transported to the hospital,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Verderosa said.\n The FBI is investigating Hodgkinson and his possible motives. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early to determine whether the attack was politically motivated, authorities said.\n The shooter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weapons \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 a 9 mm handgun and 7.62-caliber rifle \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 were recovered at the scene by law enforcement officials. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ran traces on the weapons and found no evidence to suggest Hodgkinson purchased the firearms illegally, according to an FBI statement released Thursday.\n The FBI said it was processing a cell phone, a computer and a camera recovered from Hodgkinson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s van, which was in the parking lot of a YMCA adjacent to the park.\n Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) confirmed on Wednesday that Hodgkinson had volunteered for his presidential campaign. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let me be as clear as I can be,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Sanders said in a statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who was also at the practice, told MSNBC that Scalise crawled through the dirt, bleeding, to get away from the shooter. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) told reporters that he used his belt as a tourniquet to stop a staffer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bleeding.\n Paul said that a number of aides were lying down during the attack as the shooter fired bullets their way.\n Paul told CNN that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nobody would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve survived\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d had Capitol Police not been there.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been a massacre without them,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n Noah Nathan, 47, lives in a nearby apartment building and was at the dog park when the shooting took place. He said he heard at least 30 shots and got down on the ground, but couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the shooter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no place I could go,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n The members were practicing for the Congressional Baseball Game, a D.C. tradition dating back to 1909. The event pits Republicans against Democrats and raises funds for area nonprofits, including the Washington Literacy Center, the Boys and Girls Club of Greater Washington and the Washington Nationals Dream Foundation. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s game is scheduled for Thursday night.\n Police shut down the streets for blocks around the field early Wednesday, and a helicopter was flying overhead.\n A lockdown has been lifted at the YMCA Alexandria, next to the field where the shooting took place, spokeswoman Dana Rucker told HuffPost. No members or staff were harmed in the shooting, but the building sustained bullet damage.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are shaken,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Rucker said of YMCA staff. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just grateful everyone was able to work together as a team and get out.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Hodgkinson was member of the YMCA, Rucker said in a statement. She said that while he appears to have visited the facility \u00e2\u20ac\u0153frequently and at all hours of the day,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d staff received \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no complaints\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d about his behavior.\n Lawmakers from both parties expressed sympathy for the victims. Trump said that he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply saddened\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d by the news.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our thoughts and prayers are with the members of Congress, their staffs, Capitol Police, first responders, and all others affected,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said in a statement.\n During a bipartisan briefing on Capitol Hill later Wednesday, lawmakers discussed the possibility of allowing members of Congress to use campaign funds to bolster security at their private residences.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a review of exactly what funds can and should be used in the event there are security concerns by any member,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.). He added that Ryan was investigating the matter alongside the Federal Election Commission.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking at that,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Hoyer said.\n Many previously scheduled events around Capitol Hill were canceled Wednesday, including an event Trump was scheduled to attend at the Department of Labor. The FBI is taking over the investigation into the shooting, Alexandria Police Chief Michael Brown said.\n Jay Roberts, 60, lives nearby and said the game was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153probably one of the few moments with all this rancor and politics that they can have some normalcy.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I imagined it would be something fun to watch, you know, because evidently it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partisan politics are put aside, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have a softball game, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have some fun,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n",

Adam Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the committee, said on Wednesday that the committee is prepared to use \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whatever compulsory process we need\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d to obtain information from Flynn if he does not cooperate with the subpoenas. He added that the committee could issue additional subpoenas if other witnesses fail to cooperate, but did not name additional individuals.\n Citing the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Flynn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyer said on Monday that Flynn would not comply with subpoenas from the Senate intelligence committee, which is conducting its own parallel investigation into Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interference in the election and whether it colluded with President Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s associates. The Senate committee responded with two additional subpoenas on Tuesday targeting Flynn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s businesses.\n The House committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s subpoenas \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will be designed to maximize our chance of getting the information that we need,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Schiff told reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to use whatever compulsory mechanism necessary to get the information he possesses \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the Fifth Amendment right not to provide materials or documents is limited,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he added.\n Schiff said he is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153skeptical\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d that the committee would agree to grant Flynn immunity in the future in exchange for information.\n The committee is also looking for ways to obtain documentation of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conversations with top intelligence and law enforcement officials involved in a separate federal Russia probe.\n Trump implied earlier this month that he had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tapes\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d of discussions with recently fired FBI Director James Comey that would be damaging to Comey. And the Washington Post reported earlier this week that Trump asked Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers to push back on the FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Russia investigation.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That could be further evidence of an attempt to interfere with the investigation,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Schiff said of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reported request to Coats and Rogers. He also referred to past reports that the White House asked allies on Capitol Hill to refute negative press stories about Trump associates\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ties to Russia. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If all of this is part of a pattern by the White House of interference or worse, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something that we have to find out about and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something we have to stop,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n Despite concerns about Trump interfering with ongoing investigations into his campaign, Schiff warned that it is premature for Democrats on Capitol Hill to push for impeachment.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a legal standard that needs to be met for impeachment and then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very practical standard that has to be met,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Schiff said. Practically speaking, he continued, impeachment is only possible if Republican lawmakers and the general public believe Trump is unfit for office.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the Republicans in Congress or people at large in the country feel this is simply a way to nullify an election that others didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree with, then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to meet the practical standards necessary,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Schiff said.\n",

Joe Lieberman is his top choice, according to White House pool reports. The founder of Lieberman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s law firm \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 is one of the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top lawyers.\n Trump met on Wednesday with Lieberman and three other candidates: current acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe; Frank Keating, the former governor of Oklahoma who previously served as an FBI agent and in high-level positions in the Justice Department; and Richard McFeely, who served in the FBI for 24 years before retiring as executive assistant director in 2014.\n Lieberman, who was the 2000 Democratic vice presidential nominee before losing a primary bid for re-election and becoming an independent, would be an unconventional choice. He has no federal law enforcement experience and, while currently at a high-profile law firm, is most associated as a centrist Democrat.\n He has previously said that he would support an independent commission to investigate ties between Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration and Russia. But it is his background in politics that had Democrats reacting with severe reservation.\n Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) called it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mistake\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d to select an elected official to the post, saying that the FBI director should be a law enforcement official. While Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), in an interview with Huffpost, called the possible nomination \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shocking.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no reason to appoint a politician to run the FBI,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Schatz said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is contrary to everything the FBI is about and it undermines the confidence that the public needs to have in the independence of the agency. And more to the point, it is not as if there is no one else qualified to do this job. There are literally dozens of people who would get a unanimous vote.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n It is rare for an FBI director to be appointed without the full backing of the Senate, Schatz noted. And he speculated that a Lieberman nomination would split the chamber.\n A top Senate Democratic aide, likewise, put the prospects of immense opposition to the pick bluntly in an email to HuffPost: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possibly be worse time to take the unprecedented step of handing the FBI over to a politician. That absolutely includes Senator Lieberman.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n During a Thursday Democratic caucus lunch, Sens. Dick Durbin (Ill.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.) trashed the idea of Lieberman, or any politician, being in charge of the FBI, according to a senior Democratic aide who was in the private meeting. A majority of Democrats in the room said they agreed that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a terrible choice. Not a one defended Lieberman.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The FBI director should be drawn from the ranks of career law enforcement\u00e2\u20ac\u017d, prosecutors or the FBI itself \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 not politicians,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Durbin told HuffPost later.\n Republicans, by contrast, praised Lieberman. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) expressed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great admiration\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d for the former senator, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) speculated that Lieberman could get 100 confirmation votes, and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), said he would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153overjoyed\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d if Lieberman, who is a friend of his, were picked.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Joe Lieberman has more experience than all of my Democrat colleagues combined, so screw them,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d McCain said of Democrats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 concerns.\n The need for a new FBI director came after Trump fired Comey last week, a stunning move that occurred amid the FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ties to Russia. A series of explosive reports over the last week have heightened the appearance that Trump interfered with the investigation. In particular, The New York Times reported that Trump asked Comey to shut down a separate probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contacts with Russian officials, according to a memo Comey wrote to document a meeting with Trump.\n",

The speech did not delve into policy details, and rather reprised objectives from his 2016 campaign on trade, immigration and national security.\n But the address was stitched together, more broadly, by an appeal for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new national pride\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and a rediscovery of American patriotism, as he described this as a salve for the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s divisions.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n He also rebuked those who have held power in Washington, saying a small group reaped the rewards of government while \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the people did not share\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d in Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wealth.\n The address completes Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarkable journey from political outsider written off by countless Beltway pundits to the most powerful man in the country. His campaign manager Kellyanne Conway noted in an earlier interview with Fox News that Trump was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153making history\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d as a businessman with no prior political or military experience \u00e2\u20ac\u201c someone successful in the private sector coming to Washington \u00e2\u20ac\u0153owing nobody anything.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In blunt and unvarnished terms similar to the language used during his nomination acceptance address last summer, Trump on Friday lamented the jobs lost to foreign rivals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he described \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rusted out factories scattered like tombstones\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d across the land \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the crime in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cities.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Trump said.\n Trump cast his presidency as a return to power for the people and vowed never to let them down.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153From this day forward, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be only America first,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Trump said.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6  We will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our borders, we will bring back our wealth and we will bring back our dreams.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He also vowed to eradicate Islamic terrorism.\n Telling the American people this is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153your moment\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153your day,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Trump closed his speech with the promise that started it all: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will make America great again.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n As Barack and Michelle Obama depart the White House after eight years in office, Trump will immediately be confronted with the challenge of governing, as he attempts to apply his CEO experience to running the nation.  His team has vowed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153robust\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d start to the Trump administration, which could include everything from rescinding controversial Obama actions to renegotiating trade deals to repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.\n An immediate task for the new administration will be to get Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cabinet nominees confirmed.  His advisers have complained that Democrats are slowing the process, and resisting the kind of swift confirmation the Senate gave many of Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nominees in 2009.\n Before he spoke on Friday, throngs of protesters were causing disruptions on the edges of the security zone in Washington.  Some blocked checkpoints and forced their temporary closure earlier Friday morning, while elsewhere demonstrators resorted to violence and vandalism.  They clashed with police later in the afternoon, amid dozens of arrests.\n While dozens of House Democrats boycotted Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ceremonies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a move that fueled disputes with Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team over the weekend \u00e2\u20ac\u201c other prominent Democrats and past presidents of both parties were in attendance for the transfer of power.  Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, whose loss to Trump marked one of the biggest upsets in modern political history, attended and tweeted shortly before Trump took the oath that she came to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153honor our democracy & its enduring values.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will never stop believing in our country & its future,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she wrote.\n Donald and Melania Trump met with the Obamas earlier Friday morning after attending a church service in Washington.  The new first family headed later to the parade along Pennsylvania Avenue, before an evening of inaugural balls and other festivities.\n",

In her Twitter post on Tuesday, Griffin said she was going to \"take down the image.\"\n \"I went too far and I was wrong,\" she said.\n People took to Twitter to express their disdain for the photo shoot.\n Reps for Griffin did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment.\n Chelsea Clinton called it \"vile and wrong\" in a Twitter post.\n Shields told Fox News that Griffin was hoping to create a bold message.\n \"Kathy and I are friends and we worked together before, so when we started doing this shoot, she said, 'I'd love to do something political. I'd love to make a statement,'\" he explained. \"We kind of figured out what would be the best image to make out of that.\"\n Shields added the image was meant to serve as art and he's aware that it could make some viewers uncomfortable.\n \"That's what art is meant to do,\" he said. \"Some people look at it and they love it. Some people look at it and they hate it... I understand there are going to be people that hate this. It's a very touchy subject... but this is not real. We didn't kill anybody nor do I feel anybody should be killed. It's no different from a movie. It just happens to be a still image.\"\n Shields tweeted a link to a YouTube video called \"Behind the scenes with Kathy Griffin\" but the video has since been removed. However, he later told Fox News that the video had glitches, which prompted him to take it down and then re-upload it.\n This is hardly the first time Shields' photos have caused uproar. He previously received death threats over a photo he took of \"Glee\" actress Heather Morris with bruises on her face. The photo was criticized for making light of domestic abuse.\n As for his recent collaboration with Griffin, he doesn't regret it.\n \"I can't speak for her, [but] I know she loves to stir the pot,\" he said. \"For me, I love the idea we have freedom of speech. The fact that I'm allowed to make an image like this says a lot. To me, that's a powerful thing... nobody's killed me for this image so it's not that bad. I love Kathy and I hope they let me visit her in Guantanamo.\"\n",

Gorsuch, signaling an imminent partisan showdown over the nominee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fate and the future of century-old rules in the chamber.\n As committee hearings on Judge Gorsuch concluded on Thursday, it appeared increasingly likely that Republicans hoping to elevate President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s choice for the court would resort to replacing longstanding rules with a simple majority vote on his confirmation.\n While a parade of witnesses addressed the Senate Judiciary Committee, trading dueling views of Judge Gorsuch, the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, went to the Senate floor and announced that he would try to lead Democrats in blocking an up-or-down vote on Judge Gorsuch. The Senate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cloture\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d rule requires a supermajority of 60 votes to overcome such a filibuster.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After careful deliberation I have concluded that I cannot support Judge Neil Gorsuch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nomination to the Supreme Court,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Schumer said, citing concerns over Judge Gorsuch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record on workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights and his degree of independence, adding, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My vote will be no, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Judge Gorsuch must earn the support of at least eight Democrats to break a filibuster \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a threshold he is not on track to meet, at least so far, according to interviews and internal party discussions.\n If Democrats band together, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has threatened to pursue the so-called nuclear option eliminating the filibuster for Supreme Court selections. Mr. Trump has urged Mr. McConnell to take that step if necessary.\n Some Republicans have expressed reservations about changing the rules, but Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Thursday that he would relent if it meant seating Judge Gorsuch. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whatever it takes to get him on the court, I will do,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Graham told \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Mike Gallagher Show\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d radio program.\n Mr. McConnell has said he wants the Senate to confirm Judge Gorsuch to fill the vacancy, which was created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia more than a year ago, before departing for a scheduled recess on April 7. Last year, Mr. McConnell led his party in refusing to consider President Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s choice for the seat, Judge Merrick B. Garland, during a presidential election campaign.\n On Thursday, Mr. McConnell accused Democrats of engaging in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153obstructionist tactics\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d to block a well-qualified nominee.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite the judge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outstanding performance, his exceptional background, and the extensive support he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s received from people of all political leanings, we know that some Senate Democrats will continue trying to come up with any reason to delay the confirmation process,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. McConnell said of Judge Gorsuch.\n During the four days of hearings, even Judge Gorsuch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s critics did not dispute his credentials. On Thursday, representatives of the American Bar Association told the committee that it had unanimously found Judge Gorsuch to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153well qualified,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highest rating. That was particularly notable in light of studies that have shown the group has tended to favor the nominees of Democratic presidents.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We do not give the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwell qualified\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rating lightly,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Nancy Scott Degan, an official of the bar association.\n The group had also given its highest rating to Judge Garland. Since the evening Judge Gorsuch was nominated, liberal groups have been pressuring Democrats to filibuster the vote on him.\n Four years ago, when Democrats controlled the Senate and Republican senators were blockading Mr. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeals court and executive branch nominees, Democrats changed the chamber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rules to bar filibusters for such positions \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but left the filibuster rule in place for Supreme Court nominations.\n Republicans have cited this history often in accusing their colleagues of hypocrisy on Judge Gorsuch.\n To eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, Republicans would need to vote in virtual lock step: The party effectively has only 51 votes right now because one member, Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, is recuperating from back surgery, so just two Republican senators could block a rules change.\n Still, Judge Gorsuch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nomination is broadly popular among conservatives. The question facing Democrats is whether to have a filibuster fight over Judge Gorsuch, highlighting what they consider the theft of a seat they believe Mr. Obama had a right to fill, or whether to save that attention-grabbing tactic for a hypothetical future vacancy if a more liberal justice dies or steps down and President Trump nominates a staunch conservative who would shift the court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s balance.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think we should move forward on the Gorsuch nomination until the nomination of Merrick Garland has been dealt with fairly,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, said on Thursday, signaling his support for a filibuster.\n Another moderate Democrat, Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, also said he would reject Judge Gorsuch and join the filibuster effort. Mr. Casey is among the 10 Democrats facing re-election next year in states that Mr. Trump won.\n Others in the group were less eager to declare their intentions.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to keep on my theme I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been on for a couple of months,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to talk about Gorsuch.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Even before Judge Gorsuch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nomination, Ms. McCaskill inadvertently drew the ire of liberal activists by expressing support for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a full confirmation hearing process and a vote,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d before making clear she believed in a 60-vote threshold.\n Despite the escalating political friction, the atmosphere in the hearing room on Thursday was often more perfunctory than passionate, as panels of witnesses selected by Democrats and Republicans alternately expressed concerns that Judge Gorsuch was too conservative or praised him as a well-qualified and careful judge.\n Two of Judge Gorsuch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former colleagues on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Deanell Reece Tacha, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, and Robert Harlan Henry, appointed by President Bill Clinton \u00e2\u20ac\u201d praised his intellect and temperament.\n But others expressed concerns. One strain of criticism came from human rights and civil liberties activists, who expressed alarm over Judge Gorsuch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experiences as a Justice Department official in the Bush administration in 2005 and 2006, when he helped to defend and advance the executive branch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s positions on matters like detainee treatment and surveillance.\n Jameel Jaffer, who litigated national-security cases against the government as the former deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, urged the committee to scrutinize more closely Judge Gorsuch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views on executive power and individual rights.\n Mr. Jaffer pointed to documents showing, for example, that Judge Gorsuch had worked to get Congress to enact a law stripping courts of jurisdiction to hear lawsuits by Guant\u00c3\u00a1namo Bay detainees, and in one email chain he criticized law firms that helped represent prisoners in seeking judicial review of their detention.\n On Wednesday, Judge Gorsuch told the committee that the email had not been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153my finest moment\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and that he had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153blowing off steam with a friend, privately.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., and his wife, Margaret, were indicted on charges of illegally converting $250,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses and filing false records, prosecutors announced Tuesday.\n In response, House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday evening that he would remove the congressman from all committee assignments for the time being, calling the charges against Hunter \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply serious.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Among the allegations named in the 48-page indictment included instances between 2009 and 2016 when Hunter and his wife used campaign funds to pay for family vacations to Italy and Hawaii, school tuition, dental work, and even domestic and international travel for almost a dozen relatives, according to a press release from the Southern District of California\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s U.S. Attorney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office.\n The indictment also alleged that the pair spent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tens of thousands of dollars\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d on items ranging from movie tickets, fast food, golf outings, groceries and home utilities.\n Fox News obtained a letter sent from Hunter's attorney, Gregory A. Vega, to U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein on Aug. 6 asking him to postpone the indictment.\n Vega contended that there was a \"rush to indict\" after a two-year grand jury investigation.\n Vega asserted the prosecution was \"politically motivated\" because of Hunter's early support of Donald Trump for president. He also claimed bias from prosecutors in the Southern District of California who supported Hillary Clinton's candidacy.\n The congressman's lawyers said in 2017 that Hunter and his wife repaid the campaign about $60,000.\n Prosecutors said Hunter and his wife \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mischaracterized\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the purchases in Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings to hide the illicit spending.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Family dental bills paid with campaign funds were characterized as a charitable contribution to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSmiles for Life,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the press release from the U.S. Attorney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office said as an example.\n Charges included conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States, wire fraud and falsifying records.\n Hunter, one of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earliest supporters in the presidential race, allegedly was aware of what he and his wife were doing and continued to spend campaign funds on personal expenses despite multiple warnings from his campaign treasurer about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153questionable purchases.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153According to the indictment, the Hunters knew that many of their desired purchases could be made only by using campaign funds, since they did not otherwise have sufficient personal funds to pay for their purchases,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d according to the U.S. Attorney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office.\n U.S. Attorney Adam Braverman said Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indictment proved that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no one is above the law.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The pair is due to be arraigned in court on Thursday morning.\n",

Almost 14 months after the election, Mr. Trump has kept up a regular drumbeat of attacks on Mrs. Clinton. Last year, Mr. Trump also criticized the Justice Department and Attorney General Jeff Sessions for not pursuing investigations of his political opponents.\n The Twitter post on Tuesday morning followed an article in The Daily Caller, a conservative publication that Mr. Trump closely monitors. The article said the aide, Huma Abedin, forwarded some government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009, when Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state. Yahoo was hacked in 2013, which affected all three billion of its accounts. After the breach, the data was offered for sale by a hacking collective based in Eastern Europe. Mr. Trump also implored his administration to investigate Ms. Abedin.\n The term \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deep state\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d typically refers to a shadow government of agency officials who secretly plot to influence policy; they are usually associated with countries that have authoritarian elements that undercut democratically elected leaders.\n On Friday, the State Department released about 3,000 of Ms. Abedin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work-related emails. The emails were found on the laptop of Ms. Abedin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now estranged husband, Anthony D. Weiner, and were released as part of a public records request.\n The emails found on Mr. Weiner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s computer are a sore spot for Mrs. Clinton. James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, had notified Congress shortly before the 2016 election about the existence of newly discovered emails that could be relevant to the closed investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s use of a private email server while secretary of state.\n Mrs. Clinton, in a book released last year, said Mr. Comey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disclosure hurt her campaign\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s momentum and helped Mr. Trump win the election.\n In his Twitter post, Mr. Trump also referred to the case of a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine. According to a report in Fox News, the sailor had hoped to receive a pardon from the president, but has not.\n",

Putin of Russia after the Justice Department indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers accused of hacking Democrats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 emails and computer networks during the 2016 presidential race.\n Top Republicans were mostly mute, though a handful \u00e2\u20ac\u201d including Representative Ed Royce of California, the retiring chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee; Senator John McCain of Arizona, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who has brain cancer; and Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a frequent critic of Mr. Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u201d urged the president to use the indictments to get tough with Mr. Putin when they meet on Monday in Helsinki, Finland.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153President Trump must be willing to confront Putin from a position of strength and demonstrate that there will be a serious price to pay for his ongoing aggression towards the United States and democracies around the world,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. McCain said in a statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If President Trump is not prepared to hold Putin accountable, the summit in Helsinki should not move forward.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n A grand jury indicted the officers on Friday, accusing them of conspiring to interfere with the outcome of the 2016 presidential election by hacking the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential campaign and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The indictment is part of an open investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, who is examining whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, and whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These indictments are further proof of what everyone but the president seems to understand: President Putin is an adversary who interfered in our elections to help President Trump win,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said, adding that Mr. Trump should cancel the meeting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153until Russia takes demonstrable and transparent steps to prove that they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t interfere in future elections.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n A number of Democrats lined up behind Mr. Schumer. Some on the House Foreign Affairs Committee also called for Mr. Trump to cancel the Monday session, as did Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, stopped short of calling on Mr. Trump to cancel, but he said the president should insist that other Americans be present and should demand that Mr. Putin extradite those indicted.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would not trust the president alone with Putin without some other Americans in the administration in there,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the president to break with the normal practice and meet with the Russian president alone, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trust what he says there.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The charges were announced here on Friday by Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who made clear during a news conference that the Justice Department views the hacking not as an attack on one party, but as an attack against the United States.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important for us to avoid thinking politically, as Republicans or Democrats, and instead to think patriotically as Americans,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Rosenstein said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our response must not depend on which side was victimized.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Sasse echoed that sentiment.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The U.S. intelligence community knows that the Russian government attacked the U.S.,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Sasse said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not a Republican or a Democrat view \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it is simply the reality. All patriotic Americans should understand that Putin is not America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s friend, and he is not the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s buddy. We should stand united against Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s past and planned future attacks against us.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But with the exception of Mr. McCain, Republicans steered clear of discussing whether Mr. Trump should cancel Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting in Helsinki. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, did not have any immediate reaction, while a spokeswoman for Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said simply that Mr. Ryan was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153glad these hackers are being held to account.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, a founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, asked if Mr. Trump should demand extradition of the hackers, said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll leave that to the president.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Jordan said the president has already \u00e2\u20ac\u0153been clear he is going to ask Mr. Putin some tough questions.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, said he intends to hold a hearing on election security at the end of July. But asked if Mr. Trump should recalibrate his approach to the Putin meeting, Mr. Gowdy said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s above my pay grade.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But Mr. Royce, of California, called Friday for Mr. Trump to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153use today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indictments to challenge\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Putin at Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s summit meeting, adding, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to give an inch of ground in defending democracy.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

They accused Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and moderate Democratic senators of capitulating to protect senators up for re-election in November in Republican-leaning states.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They blinked because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll always put the party and the success of the party first,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Representative Luis V. Guti\u00c3\u00a9rrez of Illinois, one of the leading Democratic advocates for immigrants, complaining that Hispanics got short shrift. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the one word they know in Spanish: ma\u00c3\u00b1ana.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The hasty retreat by 33 Senate Democrats was particularly humiliating in the immediate aftermath of the anniversary of the Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s March, which saw thousands of activists reconvene in cities across the country to protest against President Trump and congressional Republicans. Liberal groups such as MoveOn.org began urging members to sign up on Monday for rallies aimed at pressuring Republicans to protect the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers.\n By noon, their own ostensible allies in Congress had buckled.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The grass-roots are rightly furious with a slew of elected Democrats,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Ben Wikler, the Washington director of MoveOn.org. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the Obama years, Republicans learned to be more afraid of primary challenges than general elections. But Democrats are still operating as though the Tea Party is more powerful than The Resistance.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The anger on the left was reminiscent of conservative unrest that fueled primary race challenges against sitting Republican senators accused of appeasing an opposition president, Barack Obama, and his congressional allies.\n Mr. Schumer, determined to keep the fissures in his party coalition muted, used a meeting of Senate Democrats before the vote to urge the liberals in his caucus not to criticize those voting to reopen the government, according to one senator who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private meeting.\n And for the most part, the liberal senators who opposed the agreement held their fire. Democrats have largely avoided the internal insurrections that upended Republicans over the past decade. Mr. Schumer is not a figure of derision on the left as Mr. McConnell is on the right.\n And Senate Democrats have crushed most primary election challenges easily. Senate leaders have intervened freely in a number of 2018 races \u00e2\u20ac\u201d in states like Arizona and Tennessee \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to anoint more moderate standard-bearers.\n Former Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, said Democrats from the more rural states that make up much of the 2018 map would prefer to battle over issues other than immigration. The Obama-era program that protected young undocumented immigrants \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA \u00e2\u20ac\u201d is an important issue, he said, but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the bread and butter of successful Democrat politics.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our major issues are jobs, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, Social Security, infrastructure, supporting domestic programs, clean air, safe drinking water,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Dorgan said, adding of his conservative-state brethren, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While those Democrats do strongly support DACA, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure they would prefer to be discussing different issues.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But the patience of the left may be running thin. By appearing to retreat on Monday, Democrats have stirred new talk on the left about challenging incumbents who had previously given little thought to their own nominations.\n Faiz Shakir, the political director of the American Civil Liberties Union and an adviser to former Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, said the group and its allies were actively exploring places to intervene in primary elections.\n Mr. Shakir said of some Democrats that it is an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153open question, still, whether they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to fight for Dreamers.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Right now, only one Democratic senator faces a serious primary challenge: Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, who voted against the government-funding deal and complained privately that she and most of her colleagues had been asked to vote on Friday against a nearly identical measure to keep the government open.\n Ms. Feinstein has tacked to the left since Kevin de L\u00c3\u00a9on, the president of the California State Senate, announced his challenge to her in October.\n Mr. de L\u00c3\u00a9on said Monday that Democrats had made a grave mistake striking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153another fingers-crossed bargain with Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. de L\u00c3\u00a9on said he had called and left a voice mail message with Thomas E. Perez, the Democratic National Committee chairman, and planned to convey that Democrats had sent a terrible message to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153voters of color and millennial voters who feel like they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been abandoned.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Once again, the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leaders in Washington have capitulated, compromised and redrawn a line in the sand even further away from justice,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n One House Democrat is already under fire for not taking a stronger stance on behalf of immigrants: Representative Daniel Lipinski of Illinois, a moderate Democrat from Chicago who is facing a primary race challenger, Marie Newman, in March.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I asked him to sign on to Dream bill. He said, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I can do that,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Mr. Guti\u00c3\u00a9rrez, whoendorsed Ms. Newman last week. (Mr. Lipinski opposed the measure in 2010 but has said in recent months that he would support it if it comes to the House floor.)\n The chances of a successful primary election challenge in the Senate are far more remote. Many of the Democrats facing re-election in November hail from states that Mr. Trump carried and are more concerned about well-funded Republican opponents than liberal challengers.\n Of the 10 Democrats who gathered outside the Senate chamber after the vote to crow about their bipartisan agreement, six are on the ballot this year.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you want results, you have to compromise, and if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unwilling to compromise, you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get results,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You maybe get a political issue, but you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get results. And I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come here to do politics.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Progressives, however, are already eyeing one of the Democrats who pushed for a compromise: Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. On a conference call convened Sunday night by liberal groups, there was notable anger toward Ms. Klobuchar, according to two participants.\n Ms. Klobuchar, however, illustrates why the Democratic base may find it difficult to inflict payback: She is broadly popular with liberals in Minnesota, and the shutdown fight has come late enough in the congressional calendar to leave any would-be challenger with little time to prepare.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have been working hard for the people of Minnesota, and I think the people of Minnesota understand that, including in my party,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ms. Klobuchar said.\n",

Agent Peter Strzok, Who Criticized Trump in Texts, Is Fired\n\nPUBLISHED: 2018/08/13\n\nWASHINGTON \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Peter Strzok, the F.B.I. senior counterintelligence agent who disparaged President Trump in inflammatory text messages and helped oversee the Hillary Clinton email and Russia investigations, has been fired for violating bureau policies, Mr. Strzok\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyer said Monday.\n Mr. Trump and his allies seized on the texts \u00e2\u20ac\u201d exchanged during the 2016 campaign with a former F.B.I. lawyer, Lisa Page \u00e2\u20ac\u201d in assailing the Russia investigation as an illegitimate \u00e2\u20ac\u0153witch hunt.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d  Mr. Strzok, who rose over 20 years at the F.B.I. to become one of its most experienced counterintelligence agents, was a key figure in the early months of the inquiry.\n Along with writing the texts, Mr. Strzok was accused of sending a highly sensitive search warrant to his personal email account.\n The F.B.I. had been under immense political pressure by Mr. Trump to dismiss Mr. Strzok, who was removed last summer from the staff of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.  The president has repeatedly denounced Mr. Strzok in posts on Twitter, and on Monday expressed satisfaction that he had been sacked.\n Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory traces back to June, when Mr. Strzok\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conduct was laid out in a wide-ranging inspector general\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report on how the F.B.I. handled the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emails in the run-up to the 2016 election.  The report was critical of Mr. Strzok\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conduct in sending the texts, and the bureau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office of Professional Responsibility said that Mr. Strzok should be suspended for 60 days and demoted.  Mr. Strzok had testified before the House in July about how he had not allowed his political views to interfere with the investigations he was overseeing.\n But Mr. Strzok\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyer said the deputy director of the F.B.I., David Bowdich, had overruled the Office of Professional Responsibility and fired Mr. Strzok.\n A spokeswoman for the F.B.I. did not respond to a message seeking comment about why Mr. Strzok was dismissed rather than demoted.  Firing Mr. Strzok, however, removes a favorite target of Mr. Trump from the ranks of the F.B.I. and gives Mr. Bowdich and the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, a chance to move beyond the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ire.\n Aitan Goelman, Mr. Strzok\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyer, denounced his client\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dismissal.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decision to fire Special Agent Strzok is not only a departure from typical bureau practice, but also contradicts Director Wray\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony to Congress and his assurances that the F.B.I. intended to follow its regular process in this and all personnel matters,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Goelman said.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This decision should be deeply troubling to all Americans,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Goelman added.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lengthy investigation and multiple rounds of congressional testimony failed to produce a shred of evidence that Special Agent Strzok\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal views ever affected his work.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Strzok\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s text exchanges with Ms. Page demonstrated animosity toward Mr. Trump.  In one, Ms. Page asks: Trump is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not ever going to become president, right? Right?!\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d  Mr. Strzok responds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No. No he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll stop it.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d  The inspector general, who uncovered the messages, found no evidence that the pair imposed their political views on their investigative decisions but cited that exchange as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electoral prospects.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The report by the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, that preceded Mr. Strzok\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s firing not only criticized his conduct in sending the texts but also his use of personal email accounts to handle sensitive information.  In addition, the inspector general criticized Mr. Strzok\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision not to move swiftly to examine new emails related to the Clinton investigation just weeks before the 2016 election.\n Mr. Horowitz said in his report that he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply troubled\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d by the text messages.  Hundreds exchanged over months were found in which the pair disparaged Mr. Trump and, to a lesser extent, Mrs. Clinton, exchanged work gossip and bantered.\n On Twitter, Mr. Strzok said he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply saddened by this decision,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d adding, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has been an honor to serve my country and work with the fine men and women of the FBI.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Strzok became emblematic of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unfounded assertions that a so-called deep state of bureaucrats opposed to him was undermining his presidency.  Mr. Trump contended that Mr. Strzok targeted the president and accused Mr. Strzok of being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153treasonous\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disgrace.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d  Mr. Strzok told lawmakers that he never leaked information about the Russia inquiry, which could have upended the election and hurt Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chances of becoming president.\n After Mr. Horowitz uncovered the texts, Mr. Mueller, who had by then taken over the investigation, removed Mr. Strzok from his team.  He was reassigned to the F.B.I.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s human resources division.  Ms. Page, who had left Mr. Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team before the discovery of the text messages, quit the F.B.I. in May.\n The inspector general\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report also took issue with the reaction by Mr. Strzok and other F.B.I. officials to the discovery of possible new evidence in the Clinton investigation, known internally as Midyear Exam, in late September 2016 on a laptop that belonged to the disgraced politician Anthony D. Weiner, the husband of a top Clinton aide.\n At the time, Mr. Strzok was in the early stages of investigating whether any Trump associates had conspired with Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interference in the presidential election, and nearly a month passed before agents and analysts began to act on the emails found on Mr. Weiner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s laptop.  Mr. Horowitz could not rule out that Mr. Strzok had slow-walked the examination of the new emails to help Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential bid.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Under these circumstances, we did not have confidence that Strzok\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the Midyear-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he wrote.\n The delays were merely the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153result of bureaucratic snafus,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Strzok\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyer wrote last month in USA Today.\n But the justifications for the delay were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unpersuasive\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153far-reaching consequences,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the inspector general said.  James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, has told investigators that if he had known about the emails earlier, it might have influenced his decision to alert Congress to their existence days before the election.\n In addition, the inspector general said that Mr. Strzok had forwarded a proposed search warrant to his personal email account.  The inspector general said the email, which included a draft of the search warrant affidavit, contained information that appeared to be under seal.\n In a heated congressional hearing last month, Mr. Strzok expressed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant regret\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d for the texts and rebutted the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attacks on the Russia inquiry.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This investigation is not politically motivated; it is not a witch hunt; it is not a hoax,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n Mr. Strzok\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dismissal was not unexpected.  He is the second senior F.B.I. agent to be fired as a result of the inspector general\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation.  In March, Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy director, was fired after the inspector general repeatedly faulted him for misleading investigators.\n The firing was politically motivated, Mr. McCabe has said, as an effort to discredit him as a witness in the special counsel investigation.\n Both men were fired before they were eligible for their pension and health benefits.\n Mr. Strzok, 48, a graduate of Georgetown University, served as an officer in the Army before he joined the F.B.I.  He held several key positions in the F.B.I., eventually becoming a top deputy in the counterintelligence division.\n He handled many important espionage cases including one involving a former C.I.A. officer suspected of working for China and a group of Russian spies who had been working undercover in the United States.\n",

No sane country would do that, right?\" Reid said.  \"Guess again.  If you break our laws by entering this country without permission and give birth to a child, we reward that child with U.S. citizenship and guarantee a full access to all public and social services this society provides.\"\n Reid later apologized for his stance and reversed it in 1999.\n But the comments helped Trump make his controversial case, after his push first emerged in an interview with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Axios on HBO\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d.  He said he wants to use an executive order to end the practice by which children born in the U.S. of non-citizen or illegal immigrant parents are immediately a citizen.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How ridiculous, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Trump said.\n The U.S. is not the only country to grant birthright citizenship, with Canada and a number of Latin American countries also doing so, but the issue has long been a contentious one in the U.S. -- particularly for those seeking to restrict illegal immigration into the U.S.\n The 14th Amendment states that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d  Critics of birthright citizenship say that the amendment was never intended to apply to children of two non-citizens -- and particularly those who have come to the country illegally.\n Critics say the policy encourages illegal immigrants to come to the country, give birth and then try to claim residency themselves as a result.\n But many scholars counter that it would take a constitutional amendment to change the policy.  And the announcement Tuesday was met with a mixed reception by lawmakers in Congress, particularly the idea that Trump might use an executive order to impose such a significant immigration change -- something Republicans blasted former President Barack Obama for doing with the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy.\n Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said in an interview with WVLK that the 14th Amendment is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pretty clear\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153you cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d  Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said he will \"closely review\" the proposed executive order, but said that \"as a general matter, this is an issue that Congress should take the lead to carefully consider and debate.\"\n Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., announced he will be introducing legislation \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to deal with the issue of birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and said it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153magnet for illegal immigration in modern times.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n On Wednesday, Trump appeared to shift stance somewhat by avoiding saying it would be ended by executive order, while acknowledging the matter \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will be settled by the United States Supreme Court.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Democrats appeared united in condemnation against Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move this week.  In a Tuesday appearance on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the Axios interview didn't surprise her.\n \"This is just more of the same of what he's been saying,\" she said, referring to Trump's remarks on immigration.  \"What he was saying today has no relationship to what his authority is, but that's of course not unusual.\"\n",

      "text": "SOURCE: hpo\n\nTITLE: Trump Says Defense Secretary Jim Mattis Will Retire In February\n\nPUBLISHED: 2018/12/20\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted on Thursday that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general who was one of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first Cabinet picks, would be retiring at the end of February.\n Mattis, who served more than four decades in the military and headed the U.S. Central Command from 2010 to 2013, won Senate confirmation as defense secretary on Jan. 20, 2017, shortly after Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inauguration.\n The Pentagon chief, nicknamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mad Dog Mattis\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d during his time as a Marine, echoed Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for strengthening the military and beefing up its combat readiness. The budget bill the president signed into law in February earmarked $700 billion for the Defense Department this fiscal year \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 a more than 15 percent increase over the previous year and the biggest hike in military spending since 2002.\n Mattis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 resignation letter addressed to Trump indicates his final day in office will be Feb. 28.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am proud of the progress that has been made over the past two years on some of the key goals articulated in our National Defense Strategy: putting the Department on a more sound budgetary footing, improving readiness and lethality in our forces, and reforming the Department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business practices for greater performance, he wrote.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in conflict and sustain strong U.S. global influence.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In the unusual letter, Mattis also wrote that he and Trump had differing views on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Earlier this week, Trump went against Mattis by abruptly withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria. Mattis had previously argued that a small U.S. presence should remain because the counterterrorism mission there is ongoing and removing troops now would cause more problems for the region. Additionally, forces were withdrawn despite the concern by many Republicans that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153leaving would strengthen the hand of Russia and Iran, which both support Syrian President Bashar al Assad.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n News of Mattis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 departure comes in the wake of reports that the White House had been discussing who might replace him, a topic that was first reported by The Washington Post in early September.\n Some of the top names that were reportedly under consideration included four-star Army Gen. Jack Keane, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), former Treasury Department official David McCormick and former Republican Sen. Jim Talent of Missouri.\n Trump denied that he had been looking to replace Mattis, telling reporters that he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very happy\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d with him.\n That assurance came ahead of the release of a book by acclaimed Watergate journalist Bob Woodward, which reported that Mattis once told staffers that Trump has the understanding of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fifth- or sixth-grader.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mattis has denied having said that.\n A major split between Trump and Mattis concerned Russian President Vladimir Putin. The defense secretary has characterized Putin as trying to undermine NATO and assaulting Western democracies while violating international norms.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] actions are designed not to challenge our arms at this point, but to undercut and compromise our belief in our ideals,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mattis told U.S. Naval War College graduates at a commencement ceremony in June.\n Trump, in contrast, has praised Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership skills and recently roiled U.S. allies by calling for Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reinstatement to the Group of Seven major industrial nations. Russia was expelled from what was then the Group of Eight after its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.\n Mattis had also argued that the U.S. should consider staying in the Iran nuclear deal unless Tehran was found not to be abiding by the multi-nation agreement. Iran was following the pact\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rules, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors the use of nuclear energy and has verified Iranian compliance with the accord multiple times since 2015.\n Trump went on to pull out of the deal in May, claiming that it had been poorly negotiated during the Obama administration.\n Mattis opposed Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed ban on transgender service members, as well as the use of torture in the interrogation of terrorist suspects.\n His most prominent moment in the public spotlight occurred in April when he handled briefings on Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to conduct targeted airstrikes against Syria in response to the alleged use of chemical weapons by Assad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regime in that nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s civil war.\n Even then, Mattis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 recommendation that congressional approval be sought for the strikes put him at odds with the president. Trump overruled the defense secretary and unilaterally ordered the military assault.\n Mattis joins a growing list of high-profile departures from the administration. Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson earlier this year, and Tom Price stepped aside as secretary of health and human services last fall amid ethical questions about his travel practices.\n Reince Priebus lasted barely six months as White House chief of staff, and Sean Spicer had a similarly short tenure as press secretary.\n White House Communications Director Hope Hicks, a Trump aide before he won the presidency, announced her resignation in February.\n White House deputy chief of staff Joe Hagin, who also served in the Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush administrations, is expected to leave his post in July, Politico reported.\n",

Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York, was indicted on insider trading charges, and announced days later that he had suspended his re-election campaign. The two were the earliest congressional supporters of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump.\n Mr. Collins, who is accused of passing insider information to his son about a drug company on whose board he served, has said he expects to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fully vindicated and exonerated.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n A spokesman for Mr. Hunter, Michael Harrison, said Tuesday that the congressman \u00e2\u20ac\u0153believes this action is purely politically motivated,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and referred a reporter to a letter that Mr. Hunter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyer, Gregory A. Vega, sent this month to Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general. Mr. Vega, anticipating an indictment, asserted in the letter that two prosecutors involved in the investigation had attended a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton, and complained that bringing charges so close to the election would effectively deliver a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153solidly Republican\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d House seat into Democratic hands.\n The back-to-back indictments are all but certain to give ammunition to Democrats, who have been promising to clean up corruption in Washington if voters give them control of the House.\n And for California Republicans, it has immediate implications, expanding from seven to eight the field of Republican-held seats being seriously targeted by Democrats. Mr. Hunter cannot take his name off the ballot, according to a spokesman for the California secretary of state, and California does not allow write-in candidates.\n Mr. Hunter easily won California\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nonpartisan primary with 48 percent of the vote; the next highest vote-getter, Ammar Campa-Najjar, a Democrat, took only 17 percent. Despite that, Democrats have long thought they could make a play for Mr. Hunter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seat, especially if he were indicted. At the very least, the indictment will require Republicans to spend money to defend the seat.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The division, chaos and corruption in Washington has gone too far,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Campa-Najjar said in a statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indictment confirms just how deep this corruption can reach when someone like Duncan Hunter Jr. is in it for himself instead of representing the people.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The indictment details scores of instances, beginning in 2009 and continuing through 2016, in which the Justice Department said the Hunters spent campaign money on themselves. The department said that the improper use of campaign funds continued despite \u00e2\u20ac\u0153numerous warnings\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153repeated inquiries\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d from Mr. Hunter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign treasurer about questionable purchases.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The indictment alleges that Congressman Hunter and his wife repeatedly dipped into campaign coffers as if they were personal bank accounts, and falsified F.E.C. campaign finance reports to cover their tracks,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Adam L. Braverman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of California, said in a statement, referring to the Federal Election Commission.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Elected representatives should jealously guard the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trust, not abuse their positions for personal gain,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Braverman added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indictment is a reminder that no one is above the law.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Beyond the family vacations and private school tuition, the indictment said expenses included dental work, theater tickets, and domestic and international travel for almost a dozen relatives, as well as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tens of thousands of dollars on smaller purchases, including fast food, movie tickets, golf outings, video games, coffee, groceries, home utilities and expensive meals,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d according to a statement released by the Justice Department.\n The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cabin rabbit transport fees\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d were first reported in January 2017 by a California newspaper, The Press-Enterprise.\n To conceal their personal spending, the Hunters mischaracterized the purchases as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153campaign travel,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dinner with volunteers/contributors,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153toy drives,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153teacher/parent and supporter events,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gift cards\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d for charitable donations and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gift basket items,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the statement said.\n Family dental bills paid with campaign funds were characterized as a charitable contribution to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Smiles for Life.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Theater tickets were mischaracterized as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153holiday gift certificates.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Tickets for the family to see the Irish dance show Riverdance at the San Diego Civic Theater became \u00e2\u20ac\u0153San Diego Civic Center for Republican Women Federated/Fund-raising.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The Hunters are scheduled to be arraigned Thursday morning in San Diego.\n A former Marine in Iraq and Afghanistan, Mr. Hunter was first elected in 2008 to a seat held by his father, and now serves on the House Armed Services Committee. He was for a time considered as a possible choice for defense secretary or another top job in the Trump administration, and told The San Diego Union-Tribune days after Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election that he wanted to restore \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a warrior culture, a warrior mentality\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d to the government.\n By March 2017, when the Justice Department opened its criminal investigation, Mr. Hunter was already being investigated by the House Ethics Committee. His lawyer said then that the congressman intended to cooperate fully and had already repaid about $60,000 to his campaign to correct for mistaken payments for personal items.\n",

The Fake News is making such a big deal about this nothing event!\"\n \"If anybody but your favorite President, Donald J. Trump, announced that, after decimating ISIS in Syria, we were going to bring our troops back home (happy & healthy), that person would be the most popular hero in America,\" he continued in a follow-up tweet.\n \"With me, hit hard instead by the Fake News Media. Crazy!\"\n Meanwhile, the White House's plan to withdraw half its troops in Afghanistan by the summer -- some 7,000 soldiers -- has drawn similar criticism.\n While President Obama repeatedly promised to pull all troops out of Afghanistan by 2014, U.S. and NATO forces remain there in a predominately training and advising role.\n Afghanistan's security forces rely heavily on U.S. airpower against both Taliban and an upstart Islamic State affiliate.\n More than 2,400 American soldiers have died in Afghanistan since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion, and Trump announced in a video last week that troop deaths were on his mind in announcing the pullouts.\n",

Goelman said bureau Deputy Director David Bowdich \u00e2\u20ac\u0153overruled\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility to remove him.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This decision should be deeply troubling to all Americans,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the attorney said.\n The FBI responded: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mr. Strzok was subject to the standard FBI review and disciplinary process after conduct highlighted in the IG report was referred to the FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR).  OPR reviewed the investigative materials, as well as the written and oral responses of Mr. Strzok and his counsel, and issued OPR's decision.  The Deputy Director, as the senior career FBI official, has the delegated authority to review and modify any disciplinary findings and/or penalty as deemed necessary in the best interest of the FBI.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Strzok appeared to launch a new Twitter account to fire back, saying he's \"deeply saddened\" by the decision and linking to a GoFundMe page.\n President Trump and his allies for months, though, have hammered the former FBI agent and cast him as the poster child for anti-Trump bias within the bureau and Justice Department.\n Reacting to the firing, the president tweeted, \"finally,\" while asking whether the Russia case will now be dropped:\n \"Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI - finally.  The list of bad players in the FBI & DOJ gets longer & longer.  Based on the fact that Strzok was in charge of the Witch Hunt, will it be dropped?  It is a total Hoax.  No Collusion, No Obstruction - I just fight back!\"\n The president over the weekend had tweeted that Strzok and others have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153badly damaged\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation, referring to them as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clowns and losers!\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Strzok was removed from the special counsel probe last year after the discovery that he exchanged anti-Trump and other politically charged messages with colleague and lover Lisa Page.\n Judicial Watch Director of Investigations Chris Farrell on how FBI official Peter Strzok requested that he retain his security clearance after being added to special counsel Robert Mueller's team.  In June, he was then escorted from his FBI office and lost his security clearance amid the release of a scathing DOJ inspector general report that largely dealt with the DOJ and FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s handling of the investigation into Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private email server but uncovered messages that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153appeared to mix political opinion with discussions\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d about that probe -- namely, between Strzok and Page.\n The IG ultimately found no evidence that the bias among the several FBI agents impacted prosecutorial decisions in the Clinton email probe.  But Republicans have repeatedly raised concerns that anti-Trump bias played a role in the start of the investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump associates in 2016.\n One Strzok text in particular vowed to \"stop\" Trump from becoming president.\n In an explosive congressional hearing last month, Strzok sought to clear his name and address the many controversial messages.  He claimed his personal opinions did not affect his work. But Republicans tore into the FBI official, with House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy saying he exhibited \"textbook bias.\"\n Trump's allies cheered the former agent's termination on Monday.\n \"Peter Strzok was fired from the FBI because of what his own written words plainly showed:  he was willing to use his official FBI position to try and stop President Trump from getting elected.  He tarnished the FBI's sterling reputation and severely damaged public trust in an institution where trust is paramount.  His conduct should deeply concern every American,\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said in a statement to Fox News.\n Strzok\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorney, meanwhile, blasted the bureau on Monday, saying the deputy director \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reversed the decision of the career FBI official responsible for employee discipline who concluded, through an independent review process, that a 60-day suspension and demotion from supervisory duties was the appropriate punishment.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He added, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lengthy investigation and multiple rounds of Congressional testimony failed to produce a shred of evidence that Special Agent Strzok\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal views ever affected his work.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The Justice Department declined to comment for this report.\n Text messages first emerged last year, showing Strzok and Page discussing 2016 campaign politics and repeatedly blasting Trump.  In one message, Strzok called Trump an \"idiot.\"\n Messages continued to trickle out, including some reflecting apparent concern about being too tough on Clinton during the investigation into her private email system use.\n The inspector general report, meanwhile, referred a total of five FBI employees for investigation in connection with politically charged texts, suggesting more disciplinary action could be considered for additional employees.  Lisa Page left the bureau earlier this year.\n",

Any plan to protect Dreamers that relies on the word of serial liars like Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan or Donald Trump is doomed to fail,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d CREDO Political Director Murshed Zaheed said in a statement.\n CREDO Action, the activist arm of the wireless phone company, advocates for progressive causes, including immigrants rights and the passage of legislation that would give Dreamers a pathway to citizenship.\n MoveOn.org, one of the most influential progressive organizations in Washington, similarly panned the agreement that 33 Senate Democrats voted to advance to a final vote on Monday.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a bad, outrageous deal. Trump and Republicans in Congress stood with their anti-immigrant nativist base, and too many Democrats backed down, abandoned Dreamers, and failed to fight for their values,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d MoveOn.org Political Action Executive Director Ilya Sheyman said in a statement.\n McConnell said over the weekend that he intends to move to vote on an immigration bill if both parties can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree to one by Feb. 8, as long as the government is still fully open. The admission left some Senate Democrats encouraged by the prospect of a bipartisan solution \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 even if they have no guarantee from House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) that it will pass in the House.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I believe Sen. McConnell will follow through,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, told reporters on Monday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s made his commitments so publicly and so unequivocally.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Other Democrats, such as Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.), remained unconvinced that McConnell and the House Republicans would follow through on immigration.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe he made any commitment whatsoever and I think it would be foolhardy to believe that he made a commitment,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Harris said.\n While Senate Democrats did not receive everything they asked for in exchange for voting to reopen the government, they did manage to get the Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Health Insurance Program funded for six years. And if McConnell doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t follow through on immigration, Democrats will still be able to use his promise to vote against the next spending bill on Feb. 8 and pin the blame on Republicans.\n For now, though, Democrats who voted to reopen the government said that simply pushing the conversation in the right direction was a victory on its own.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I can guarantee a House outcome but I think the stronger the bill, in terms of the strength of the bipartisanship in the bill \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 the odds go up in the House,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) told HuffPost on Monday.\n",

They have banned a number of pages and accounts in recent weeks for being involved in activity intended to disrupt the midterm elections, and almost all of the major platforms removed content from Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist, this month over what they called hateful and violent speech.\n After the content from Mr. Jones and his website, Infowars, was removed, he issued a plea to Mr. Trump to block the companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 actions and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153come out before the midterms and make the censorship the big issue.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In the same video appeal, Mr. Jones urged Mr. Trump to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153point out that the communist Chinese have penetrated and infiltrated\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the American election system and are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153way, way worse than the Russians.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Minutes after his tweets on Saturday morning about social media, the president \u00e2\u20ac\u201d who has long had an affinity for conspiracy theories \u00e2\u20ac\u201d appeared to do just that.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All of the fools that are so focused on looking only at Russia should start also looking in another direction, China,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Trump wrote.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But in the end, if we are smart, tough and well prepared, we will get along with everyone!\n Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweets on Saturday, sent from his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., were not the first time he has accused social media companies of discriminating against Republicans.  Last month, he joined with prominent conservatives who have seized on the heightened enforcement of guidelines and the concept of shadow banning on Twitter \u00e2\u20ac\u201d making social media posts invisible to everyone except the posters themselves \u00e2\u20ac\u201d as proof of biased attacks on their views.\n Twitter has said that it does not shadow ban users, although it has struggled to define what its policies against hate speech are.  In the case of Mr. Jones, it did not initially join the other major platforms in removing his content, and has since taken relatively minor steps against him.\n Mr. Jones has had his posts and videos on his personal account and on Infowars severely restricted or removed by Apple, Facebook, Google and Spotify.  Twitter, which initially said Mr. Jones and Infowars had not violated its policies, later suspended the two accounts for a week for violating rules against inciting violence.\n In his tweets on Saturday, Mr. Trump urged social media companies to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153let everybody participate, good & bad,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d saying that while networks like CNN and MSNBC might be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fake news,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he does not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ask that their sick behavior be removed.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Yet Mr. Trump has waged relentless attacks on news coverage that he does not like, and has long expressed hostility toward traditional press freedoms.  He has vowed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153open up\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s libel laws, even though those statutes are in fact state, not federal, laws. \n",

Several of the packages went through a U.S. postal facility in Opa-locka, which is less than 10 miles from Aventura.\n The Department of Justice will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.\n Federal authorities had been focusing on Florida as the location where the majority of packages originated.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some of the packages went through the mail,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen earlier told Fox News.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They originated, some of them, from Florida.  I am confident that this person or people will be brought to justice.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The Miami-Dade County Police Department confirmed Thursday it was helping federal agents who were at the facility in Opa-locka as part of the ongoing investigation.\n The USPS operates an innovative imaging system that photographs each piece of mail processed throughout the country.  Investigators were likely relying on that system to pinpoint where some of the packages were mailed.\n The FBI said the packages each consisted of a manila envelope with a bubble-wrap interior containing potentially destructive devices.  The packages were addressed with a computer-printed address label and six stamps.\n A government source told Fox News the FBI was analyzing the stamps in Quantico.  The source also said the investigation had progressed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significantly\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and that the FBI was reaching out to retailers to zero in on where the elements of the bombs were made and where they were sold.\n The envelopes and packaging materials likely contained a treasure trove of DNA information.  Tiny bits of genetic material \u00e2\u20ac\u201c traces of sweat, skin cells, saliva, hair or fingerprints \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are typically used as a roadmap to the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s door, investigators and bomb experts say.\n The Washington, D.C., field office and the FBI headquarters had 24 teams in place and on the hunt for the culprit.\n Forensic investigators in Quantico, Va., have been sifting through the packages addressed to former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, liberal billionaire George Soros, former Attorney General Eric Holder, former CIA Director John Brennan and California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters.\n The devices are thought to have been fashioned from crude, bomb-making designs widely available on the Internet.  Authorities haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t said whether the devices were built to explode and kill or simply sow fear.\n Ryan Morris, founder of Tripwire Operation Group, a company that provides explosives training to law enforcement and military officials, called the devices \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mickey Mouse\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d bombs that were meant to be found.  He told Fox News he believes the primary motive is fear.  The packages were sent about two weeks ahead of the midterm elections.\n Regardless, investigators were treating the devices as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153live\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d explosives New York City Police Commissioner James O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neill said.\n Larry Johnson, a former head of criminal investigations for the U.S. Secret Service who also served as a special agent in charge of the presidential protective detail, agreed that bomb makers usually leave evidence \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and their signature- behind.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there is a human involved, there is a high probability you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to get somewhere investigatively,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he told The Associated Press.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There will be no stone left unturned.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Johnson believes it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly likely\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the person who built the bombs will have been previously flagged by law enforcement.  The Secret Service maintains a wide database of groups and individuals who have made threats in the past against presidents or other top political leaders and activists via email, letters or on social media.\n James Fitzgerald, a retired FBI profiler and forensic linguist who, in 1996, helped catch \"Unabomber\" Ted Kaczynski -- who killed 3 people and injured 23 in bombings between 1978 and 1995 -- told Fox News on Wednesday that the letter sent to John Brennan, the former director of the CIA and a staunch Trump critic, reminded him of something the Unabomber would send because of the number of stamps used on the package.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The linguist in me noticed that Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the last name is spelled missing a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and John Brennan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name is spelled missing an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and that kind of surprised me and I have a feeling that was done on purpose to make this look like somebody who doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really know who these people are and that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an honest mistake.  If he had this much anger and vitriol against these people, you would think he would know how to spell their names\n",

A terse response from the GOP only said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No collusion.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d But the investigation is ongoing, and there hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet been a determination on possible collusion with the Trump campaign.\n The indictments did reveal that attempts to hack into Democratic Party emails occurred later the same day that Trump called on Russians in a speech to uncover emails that his rival Hillary Clinton had held on a private server.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will tell you this, Russia: If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re listening, I hope you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Trump said at a Florida news conference on July 27, 2016. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n White House officials were reportedly furious that the indictments were announced by U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Friday morning, just days before the planned summit with Putin.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big F-U from [special prosecutor Robert] Mueller,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d a White House official told Politico, adding that it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an accident\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d that the indictments were announced before the Helsinki summit.\n",

Let everybody participate, good & bad, and we will all just have to figure it out!\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said at the end of a lengthy post on Twitter.\n Both Facebook and Twitter have been under fire for allegedly censoring accounts, while ignoring rules violations by liberal and left-wing users.  Trump in the past has referred to alleged \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shadow banning\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d by Twitter as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153discriminatory and illegal.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Trump uses Twitter on a daily basis, and his campaign was credited for its use of Facebook as one of the ways it secured its victory in November 2016.\n While conservatives have complained for years about what they say is discrimination by the tech giants, the controversy escalated last month when Vice News reported the issue, saying that accounts from top Republicans including GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel were being given limited visibility on Twitter.  Twitter at the time said it was an algorithmic glitch that has since been fixed.\n \"We do not shadow ban.  You are always able to see the tweets from accounts you follow (although you may have to do more work to find them, like go directly to their profile).  And we certainly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shadow ban based on political viewpoints or ideology,\" the tech giant said in a statement.\n \"We do rank tweets and search results.  We do this because Twitter is most useful when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immediately relevant.  These ranking models take many signals into consideration to best organize tweets for timely relevance,\" the statement said.  \"We must also address bad-faith actors who intend to manipulate or detract from healthy conversation.\"\n A Facebook executive apologized last month for mistreating Diamond and Silk -- two pro-Trump personalities who have long claimed they are being censored by the platform, but the company has also denied being biased against conservatives.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We badly mishandled our communications with them,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Monika Bickert, head of Global Policy Management at Facebook, said at a House Judiciary Committee hearing.\n But that has done little to calm the controversy, and Trump on Saturday accused social media sites of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153closing down the opinions of many people on the right, while at the same time doing nothing to others.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \"Too many voices are being destroyed, some good & some bad, and that cannot be allowed to happen,\" he tweeted.\n He went on to call censorship \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a dangerous thing\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and then took a swipe at CNN and MSNBC, saying that while they are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fake,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he does not demand that offending content be taken off air.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you are weeding out Fake News, there is nothing so Fake as CNN & MSNBC, & yet I do not ask that their sick behavior be removed,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he tweeted.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I get used to it and watch with a grain of salt, or don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t watch at all..\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d \n",

He faces up to 48 years in prison.\n In remarks at the White House before a youth leadership summit, Trump congratulated local and national law enforcement agencies for apprehending the suspect. The president pledged to prosecute those responsible \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153them, him, her, whoever it may be,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 to the fullest extent of the law.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We must never allow political violence to take root in America,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Trump said.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The bottom line is that Americans must unify,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he went on. His comments echoed those he has delivered at rallies and sent over Twitter in the wake of the bomb scares, calling for unity and a calmer discourse but refusing to tone down his own inflammatory rhetoric.\n Minutes after addressing the threats to prominent Democrats, Trump claimed Republicans are often attacked for supporting him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Come to think of it, does anyone get attacked more than me?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Trump said.\n The development came hours after two additional packages were discovered, one addressed to Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and the other to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.\n A suspicious package was also found Friday in Burlingame, California, addressed to Democratic donor Tom Steyer, CNN and NBC reported. A law enforcement source told CNN the package was similar to the other ones sent to politicians and public figures this week.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re thankful that everyone we work with at NextGen America and Need to Impeach is safe,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Steyer said in a statement Friday, referring to his super PAC NextGen and his campaign to impeach Trump. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are seeing a systematic attack on our democracy and our rule of law that extends much further than just one isolated terrorist in Florida. Whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voter suppression, voter intimidation, attacks on our free press, gerrymandering, or attempted violence \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 the trust and norms that are the actual basis for our civil society and political system are being eroded.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Authorities have heightened their search in Florida, as several of the packages may have passed through the state. The FBI said Friday that the package for Booker was found in a Florida mail facility.\n Throughout the week, more than 10 packages containing potential explosive devices have been mailed to lawmakers and other public figures critical of Trump, including former President Barack Obama, former President Bill Clinton, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2016 presidential opponent Hillary Clinton, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), actor Robert De Niro and former CIA Director John Brennan.\n The package addressed Brennan was sent to CNN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s New York City bureau, sparking an evacuation Wednesday. Brennan is an MSNBC and NBC contributor. On Friday, postal officials intercepted the package for Clapper, a CNN contributor, before it could reach the CNN offices, where it was addressed, according to the network.\n The Sacramento County Sheriff Department also said Friday that a suspicious package found at a Sacramento mail facility and addressed to Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) contained an explosive device. FBI officials said they believed the package to be related to the others mailed out this week.\n All of the confirmed packages listed the Florida office of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, as the return address.\n Asked why Sayoc appeared to be targeting Democratic politicians and others critical of Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know but that the suspect \u00e2\u20ac\u0153appears to be a partisan\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Wray added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too early at this stage to discuss motive.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Investigators identified Sayoc based on a fingerprint found on the package sent to Waters and a DNA sample from a previous arrest in Florida, DOJ officials said Friday.\n When law enforcement arrested him on Friday in Plantation, Florida, they also took possession of a van covered in stickers supporting Trump and criticizing Democratic officials.\n Sayoc is a registered Republican and a self-described promoter and booking agent. He has a history of multiple arrests, including for felony grand theft and misdemeanor retail theft.\n A spokeswoman for Brevard College in North Carolina confirmed to HuffPost that Sayoc attended the school for three semesters starting in the fall of 1980 and did not graduate.\n Authorities were initially vague about the content of the packages, calling them simply \u00e2\u20ac\u0153suspected explosive devices.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Wray elaborated at Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press briefing that each device contained roughly 6 inches of PVC pipe, as well as a small clock and wiring. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These are not hoax devices,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n Wray noted that the investigation was ongoing and warned there could be other packages not yet intercepted.\n",

He has brown eyes, black hair and a scar on his left arm, the records said, and was born in New York.  The records listed Mr. Sayoc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s occupation as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153manager.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n According to a 2012 bankruptcy petition filed in Miami, Mr. Sayoc resided at the time at his mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lives w/mom,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d a handwritten note on the petition said.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Has no furniture.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n On Friday morning, the authorities surrounded a white van with pro-Trump stickers on it, and television news later showed images of the authorities hauling the van away on a truck underneath a tarp.  But it remained unclear if the van belonged to Mr. Sayoc.\n Some residents of Aventura reported seeing a similar white van covered in pro-Trump stickers often parked in the lot of a local strip mall, the Aventura Waterways shopping center.  But it was not immediately clear if that van was the same one seized by the police on Friday.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It struck me because of the crazy conspiratorial stickers covering the windows,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said David Cypkin, a documentary film producer and editor with the Rakontur production company.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was unsettling, and also it seemed to be occupied.  Sometimes the door would be ajar or a window would be open, which indicated to me that maybe somebody was living in the van.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Speaking at the White House on Friday, Mr. Trump praised law enforcement officials for quickly arresting a suspect.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We must never allow political violence to take root in America.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Sayoc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest came only hours after the mysterious spate of pipe bombs spread further as federal authorities said on Friday morning that they had found two more of the explosive devices: one addressed to Senator Cory Booker and the other to James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence.\n Although no formal charges have been filed yet in the case, two of the law enforcement officials said there was a high likelihood that Mr. Sayoc would be prosecuted at least in part in Federal District Court in Manhattan.  The F.B.I.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s New York office has been leading the investigation and five of the bombs sent this week fall under the jurisdiction of the United States attorney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office in Manhattan.\n The package addressed to Mr. Clapper was meant to be delivered to the New York offices of CNN, where he works as an analyst, but was intercepted at a mail facility in Midtown Manhattan, police officials in New York City said.  The package addressed to Mr. Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, was found in Florida, which two people briefed on the matter have said has become a focus of the intense, nationwide investigation into the bombs.\n At a news conference on Friday morning, John Miller, the New York Police Department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism, said a postal worker at the mail facility on 52nd Street recognized the package addressed to Mr. Clapper as similar to other suspicious packages discovered this week and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153froze it in the system.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bomb squad responded to the facility and secured the package for delivery to an F.B.I. lab in Quantico, Va., Mr. Miller said.\n Speaking on CNN on Friday, Mr. Clapper said he was not surprised that a device had been sent to him.  He has been a frequent critic of President Trump, a similarity shared with everyone whose names have appeared on the packages discovered so far.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is definitely domestic terrorism,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Clapper said.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anyone who has in any way been a critic, publicly been a critic of President Trump, needs to be on an extra alert.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Clapper also said that on Wednesday night he had taken precautions after the first packages were discovered.  While he and his wife were away from their home this week, he added, he told his neighbor not to collect their mail.\n All together, 12 crude explosive devices have been found since Monday, sent through the mail to a host of Democrats and other prominent figures who have been among Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most vocal detractors.  The packages \u00e2\u20ac\u201d virtually identical in plain manila envelopes \u00e2\u20ac\u201d have been addressed to former President Barack Obama; former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; Representative Maxine Waters of California; former Attorney General Eric Holder; John O. Brennan, a former C.I.A. director, the actor Robert De Niro; and George Soros, the billionaire Democratic donor.\n All of the envelopes had return address labels bearing the misspelled name of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat whose district is in southern Florida.  None of the devices inside have exploded on their own so far, and investigators are still seeking to determine whether they were even capable of detonating.  But the authorities in New York and elsewhere have warned that the devices should be considered dangerous.\n The first package was discovered on Monday afternoon at the suburban New York home of Mr. Soros.  While investigators initially thought that some devices were hand delivered, they now believe it is likely all of them were sent in the mail.  Using information collected by the United States Postal Service, investigators have focused their attention on certain Florida postal centers, including one in Opa-locka near Miami.\n",

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ridiculous. And it has to end.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In fact, at least 30 other countries, including Canada, Mexico and many others in the Western Hemisphere, grant automatic birthright citizenship, according to a study by the Center for Immigration Studies, an organization that supports restricting immigration and whose work Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advisers often cite.\n But Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan met with swift pushback from some even in his own party on Tuesday. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who is retiring, said in an interview that the president \u00e2\u20ac\u0153obviously\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d cannot eviscerate birthright citizenship by executive order.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You obviously cannot do that,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ryan told WVLK, a radio station in Lexington, Ky. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a believer in following the plain text of the Constitution, and I think in this case, the 14th Amendment is pretty clear, and that would involve a very, very lengthy constitutional process.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Ryan compared the idea of doing so to Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2012 action to grant work permits and deportation reprieves to some undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, which Republicans, including Mr. Trump, vociferously protested as a naked abuse of presidential power.\n Doing away with birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants was an idea Mr. Trump pitched as a presidential candidate, but there is no clear indication that he would be able to do so unilaterally, and attempting to would be certain to prompt legal challenges. The consensus among legal scholars is that he cannot, but Mr. Trump and his allies are eager to test it in the Supreme Court.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We all cherish the language of the 14th Amendment, but the Supreme Court of the United States has never ruled on whether the language of the 14th Amendment \u00e2\u20ac\u201d \u00e2\u20ac\u2122subject to the jurisdiction thereof\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d applies specifically to people who are in the country illegally,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Vice President Mike Pence told Politico in an interview on Tuesday, several hours after Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments were reported.\n It is likewise unknown how serious Mr. Trump is about taking the action. In recent days, with the approach of the midterm balloting in which Republican control of Congress is at risk, he has sought to appeal to voters by making other dramatic claims that appear to have no chance of materializing, such as imminent action to grant a 10 percent tax cut for the middle class.\n To accomplish the idea he floated on Tuesday, Mr. Trump would have to find a way around the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which states, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The amendment means that any child born in the United States is considered a citizen. Amendments to the Constitution cannot be overridden by presidential action \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they can be changed or undone only by overwhelming majorities in Congress or the states, with a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress or through a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of state legislatures.\n Some conservatives have long made the argument that the 14th Amendment was meant to apply only to citizens and legal permanent residents, not immigrants who are present in the country without authorization. In an opinion piece in The Washington Post this year, Michael Anton, a former spokesman for Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Security Council, said birthright citizenship was based on a misreading of the amendment, and of an 1898 Supreme Court ruling that he argued pertained only to the children of legal residents.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The notion that simply being born within the geographical limits of the United States automatically confers U.S. citizenship is an absurdity \u00e2\u20ac\u201d historically, constitutionally, philosophically and practically,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Anton wrote in July. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An executive order could specify to federal agencies that the children of noncitizens are not citizens.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Trump told Axios that while he initially believed he needed a constitutional amendment or action by Congress to make the change, the White House Counsel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office has advised him otherwise.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re saying I can do it just with an executive order,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Trump said. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for clarification of the legal grounds the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyers have given him for validating such a move.\n His discussion of the idea comes after the administration announced it was streaming more than 5,000 active-duty troops to the southern border, part of an election-season rash of executive action Mr. Trump has undertaken as he works to energize his anti-immigrant base.\n It also follows action by the Trump administration to try to discourage legal immigrants from using public benefits through a new federal rule that would deny green card status to people who use social safety net services, like food assistance and Medicaid.\n The proposal provoked outrage among civil rights groups, a response that Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advisers have argued privately is a central objective of many of the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most aggressive proposals on immigration and other matters.\n Jess Morales Rocketto, the chairwoman of Families Belong Together, an immigrant advocacy group, called the idea \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ethnic cleansing.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, called the idea illegal and offensive.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aside from being unconstitutional, such an executive order would exacerbate racial tensions, exploit fears and drive further polarization across the country at a moment that calls for the promotion of unity and inclusion,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ms. Clarke said in a statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The letter and spirit of the Fourteenth Amendment places those born in this country on equal footing, and an executive order that strips away citizenship would create a permanent group of second-class citizens and invite litigation.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Some Republicans also rejected Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion, an indication of the political risks for the party that attend the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid to stoke anti-immigrant sentiment in advance of next Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voting.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The President is wrong to end #BirthrightCitizenship,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Bob Hugin, a Republican candidate for Senate in New Jersey, said in a Twitter post. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a nation of immigrants made better by the diversity of its people, especially in NJ. We need compassionate comprehensive immigration reform now.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n A 1898 Supreme Court decision held that Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco to Chinese parents residing in the United States, was a citizen because of his birth on American soil. Mr. Anton argued in The Post that because his parents were legal residents, the ruling should not be read as an affirmation of the status of children of undocumented immigrants.\n But immigration advocates argue that scrapping the concept of birthright citizenship would do away with a vital principle, and would be counterproductive to the stated goals of those who, like Mr. Trump, rail routinely against illegal immigration. According to a study by the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan group, if citizenship were denied to every child with at least one unauthorized parent, the unauthorized population in the United States would reach 24 million by 2050 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d more than double what it is now.\n Stephen Legomsky, a Washington University School of Law professor and former chief counsel for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said the 14th Amendment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s application to the children of undocumented immigrants was a matter of pure common sense.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Like anyone else, native-born Americans, whoever their parents are, can be charged with crimes if they disobey U.S. law,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Legomsky said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How would this be possible if the U.S. had no jurisdiction over them?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

At the time, he was one of several lawmakers to announce his eventual departure from Congress after being accused of sexual harassment and discrimination.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While I planned on serving out the remainder of my term in Congress, I know in my heart it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for me to move along and look for new ways to serve,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Farenthold said in a statement on Friday, thanking his staff, his family and the voters who elected him.\n It was known for several years that Mr. Farenthold, already notorious for a heavily circulated photograph of him in duck pajamas, had been accused of sexual harassment by Lauren Greene, his former communications director. She sued him in 2014, claiming that he had illegally fired her after she complained about mistreatment.\n But in December, the extent of Mr. Farenthold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s settlement was revealed when Congress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office of Compliance released details of six settlements that it had paid out since 2013 as part of a review of discrimination and sexual harassment in congressional offices. His case was the only settlement involving sexual harassment since 2013.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While I 100 percent support more transparency with respect to claims against members of Congress, I can neither confirm nor deny that settlement involved my office,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Farenthold said at the time.\n A decision in 2015 by the Office of Congressional Ethics, an independent, nonpartisan board, cleared him of wrongdoing, and he promised to repay the settlement.\n A spokeswoman for Mr. Farenthold did not respond to questions about whether he had fulfilled that promise or whether he would do so after resigning. But fellow Republicans suggested that he had not.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mr. Farenthold made a commitment that he would reimburse taxpayers for the settlement,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Speaker Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He reiterated his commitment to the speaker, and the speaker expects him to follow through.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Representative Steve Stivers, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, also said in a statement that he hoped Mr. Farenthold would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153true to his word\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and pay back the taxpayer money.\n After the disclosure, more of his aides came forward to accuse Mr. Farenthold of fostering a hostile environment, describing a congressman with a harsh temper who made sexually explicit jokes and engaged in casual sexual banter.\n The House Ethics Committee also opened a subcommittee investigation into Ms. Greene\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allegations.\n In a video in December announcing his resignation, Mr. Farenthold continued to deny the allegations, but he acknowledged running an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unprofessional\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d workplace and said he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153profoundly sorry\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d for his actions. At the time, Republican leadership praised his decision to step aside, over Democratic criticism that he should immediately resign.\n After his resignation on Friday, Mr. Farenthold deleted his Twitter account and the Facebook campaign page where he first announced his decision to not seek re-election.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Leaving my service in the House,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said in his statement, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m able to look back at the entirety of my career in public office and say that it was well worthwhile.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Trump slams 'crooked' Hillary aide Huma, calls on 'Deep State' DOJ to act\n President Trump went after \"Crooked\" Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin on Tuesday, appearing to call on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Deep State\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Justice Department to look at potential security issues in her handling of classified material after a recent email dump.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Crooked Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top aide, Huma Abedin, has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols. She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Remember sailors pictures on the submarine? Jail!\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Trump tweeted early Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Deep State Justice Dept must finally act? Also on Comey & others.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Trump was referring to U.S. Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was put in prison for taking unauthorized photos inside a nuclear submarine. He seemed to suggest a double standard is at play, compared with the lack of punishment for Clinton and her aides.\n The president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweet comes after the State Department, in a Friday news dump, released a batch of emails from Abedin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s account that were discovered by the FBI on a laptop belonging to her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner. At least four of the documents were marked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153classified.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Abedin also forwarded sensitive State Department emails to her personal Yahoo email account before every Yahoo account was hacked, first reported by the Daily Caller. Abedin also sent passwords for her government laptop to her Yahoo account on Aug. 24, 2009.\n In 2013, Yahoo was hacked, and the company said in a statement that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all Yahoo user accounts were affected\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d by the theft.\n Former FBI Director James Comey, who led the Clinton email investigation, said during a congressional hearing last year that he believed Abedin forwarded emails to Weiner for him to print out so that she could give them to Clinton.\n Abedin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emails shook the 2016 presidential race, as Comey told Congress on Oct. 28, 2016, just days before the election, that the FBI had found more of Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s messages on Weiner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s laptop as they investigated a sexting case against him.\n The discovery of those records reopened the case against Clinton, several months after Comey said he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommending any charges be filed in the case. Comey at the time said Clinton was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremely careless\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d in her handling of classified emails on her private server.\n",

Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) and his wife, Margaret Hunter, were indicted Tuesday on charges of improperly using campaign funds for private use.\n A grand jury in San Diego indicted the Hunters on charges of filing false campaign finance records, saying the couple misused more than $250,000 after a two-year investigation. The Justice Department said the pair used political money to pay for their children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tuition and spent thousands of dollars at shopping malls, Washington restaurants and surf shops, among other expenditures.\n The indictment includes details accusing the Hunters of making efforts to hide their personal expenses, including labeling fees for dental work as a donation to a charity called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Smiles for Life\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and tickets to see Riverdance as a fundraising event for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Republican women.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Hunter, 41, is a five-term congressman representing San Diego County who served for three tours in Afghanistan and Iraq as a Marine. His family has been a household name in California politics for decades, and his father, also named Duncan Hunter, served in the U.S. House for nearly 30 years until handing the reins to his son.\n Hunter had blamed his wife, who acted as a campaign manager, for many of the improper charges, saying she controlled the campaign\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credit card, and in February he feigned ignorance in an interview with Politico, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nah, I know the rules.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And if I did\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d spend campaign funds improperly, he said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it was an accident and I paid it back.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He repaid his campaign more than $60,000 earlier this year for improper expenses dating back to 2015, but the FBI began investigation additional charges dating back as far as 2009, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The goal of the conspiracy was for Duncan Hunter and Margaret Hunter to enrich themselves, and others at their direction, by converting campaign funds for their own personal benefit and enjoyment,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the 47-page indictment says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Hunters knew that many of their desired purchases could be made only by using campaign funds, since they did not otherwise have sufficient personal funds to pay for their purchases.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In a speech earlier this month, Hunter echoed President Donald Trump and castigated the Justice Department, accusing the agency of being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153corrupt, answerable to no one\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and said it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uses the law to extort the American people and effect political change.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I call on this Congress to root out all the corrupt lawyers and bureaucrats in the DOJ and the FBI so the greatest president of my generation can do the work that the American people duly elected him to do,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Hunter said.\n The lawmaker is running for re-election in November against Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar.\n When HuffPost asked Hunter how his campaign was going at the end of July, just before House lawmakers left for the August break, Hunter said things were good.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big wave right now,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Hunter said, referring to a wave of Democratic gains.

But on Thursday, in an extraordinary rebuke of the president, he decided that Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to withdraw roughly 2,000 American troops from Syria was a step too far.\n Officials said Mr. Mattis went to the White House with his resignation letter already written, but nonetheless made a last attempt at persuading the president to reverse his decision about Syria, which Mr. Trump announced on Wednesday over the objections of his senior advisers.\n Mr. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, was rebuffed. Returning to the Pentagon, he asked aides to print out 50 copies of his resignation letter and distribute them around the building.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My views on treating allies with respect and also being cleareyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Mattis wrote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n His resignation came as Congress appeared to be hurtling toward a government shutdown and as a deep market slump became even worse over fears of continuing government turmoil.\n With the ousting this month of John F. Kelly as White House chief of staff, Mr. Mattis was the last of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s old-guard national security team \u00e2\u20ac\u201d leaving policy in the hands of Mike Pompeo, the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second secretary of state, and John R. Bolton, the third White House national security adviser.\n Mr. Trump said that Mr. Mattis, 68, will leave at the end of February, and that Mr. Mattis \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The president said he would name a replacement soon.\n As Mr. Mattis was handing in his resignation, the Pentagon was preparing to draw down forces in Afghanistan. Two Defense Department officials said Thursday that about 7,000 troops will be withdrawn in the coming months \u00e2\u20ac\u201d cutting in half the number of American forces there \u00e2\u20ac\u201d in an early step to ending the United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 involvement in the 17-year war.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is scary,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a Twitter post. He called Mr. Mattis \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an island of stability amidst the chaos of the Trump administration.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, called it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a sad day for America because Secretary Mattis was giving advice the President needs to hear.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He added that Mr. Mattis \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rightly believes that Russia and China are clear adversaries and that we are at war with jihadists across the globe who plot to kill Americans at home.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Mattis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation letter was the sharpest, and most public, protest from inside the Trump administration over the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rejection of the alliances and relationships that have underpinned American security since the end of World War II.\n It was also the first resignation over a major national security issue by a leading cabinet member since 1980, when Cyrus Vance quit as secretary of state. Mr. Vance left over President Jimmy Carter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to attempt a rescue effort for American hostages in Iran that Mr. Vance considered ill-advised and that ended in tragedy.\n Mr. Mattis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s letter did not single out any decision. Instead, it condemned Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach to the world as destructive to American influence and power.\n He said the core of American national interests lay in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153providing effective leadership to our alliances,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and specifically described the importance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a defense alliance Mr. Trump has often derided. Mr. Mattis also praised the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Defeat ISIS\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d coalition that Mr. Trump just abandoned in Syria.\n But Mr. Mattis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core complaint was that Mr. Trump had lost sight of the importance of the competition for global power with Russia and China, who want \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a world consistent with their authoritarian model.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Mattis was the primary author of a new American defense strategy whose central goal was to take on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153revisionist\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d powers \u00e2\u20ac\u201d an approach that some of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former advisers say the president never fully comprehended.\n Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to pull out of Syria, which was opposed by virtually every high-level administration official but lauded by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, was the last straw. Among his other concerns, Mr. Mattis viewed the withdrawal as abandoning Kurdish fighters and other American allies, and as ceding critical territory to Russia and Iran.\n No senior Pentagon official has defended the withdrawal publicly, despite requests from the White House. As a result, Mr. Trump appeared by himself in a video \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which he tweeted Wednesday evening \u00e2\u20ac\u201d announcing victory over the Islamic State.\n During Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting at the White House, officials said that Mr. Trump again asked Mr. Mattis to publicly endorse the Syria decision. Mr. Mattis refused.\n The president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweets announcing the departure of his defense secretary shocked officials at the Pentagon, who as recently as Thursday afternoon were insisting that Mr. Mattis had no intention of resigning.\n Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selection of Mr. Mattis as his Pentagon chief only weeks after his 2016 election was widely praised. The career Marine was respected among allies and adversaries and on Capitol Hill, and he was beloved in the Pentagon as a protector against a president with scant understanding of his own role as commander in chief.\n Mr. Mattis commanded Marines in Afghanistan and in the 2003 invasion of Iraq before becoming the head of United States Central Command, overseeing all American troops in the Middle East. Though a colorful, hard-charging advocate of aggressive offensive action, Mr. Mattis viewed a tough American posture overseas as a way to deter war, not to start them, with potential foes like Iran.\n He favored working with allies, and often spoke of how difficult it was to conduct American policy without the benefit of friends. During his job interview with Mr. Trump in 2016, Mr. Mattis said he did not believe in torturing terrorism suspects to get information because he thought he could get more out of detainees by talking to them over a pack of cigarettes and a beer.\n The relationship between Mr. Mattis and Mr. Trump had deteriorated for months. The widely accepted narrative that Mr. Mattis was the adult in the room when at the White House came to annoy the president. In October, Mr. Trump accused Mr. Mattis of being a Democrat \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a charge akin to treason in the current Republican administration.\n As defense secretary, Mr. Mattis oversaw the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful military, supervising active-duty troops based in the United States and deployed worldwide, including in war zones in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and on the Saudi border with Yemen. There are also around 25,000 American troops in South Korea, where they have served for generations as a deterrent against North Korea.\n As with Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s abrupt firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the split with Mr. Mattis was a full turn in a relationship that once appeared strong.\n In Mr. Mattis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early days as defense secretary, he often ate dinner with the president in the White House residence. Over hamburgers, and with the help of briefing folders, Mr. Mattis explained to Mr. Trump key points about the United States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 relationships with allies.\n But Mr. Mattis also quietly slow-walked a number of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposals, including banning transgender troops, starting  a Space Force and putting on a costly military parade. In each case, he went through the motions of acquiescing to the White House \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and then buried the plans in Defense Department red tape.\n",

He suddenly faced calls to rally outside his Brooklyn apartment and suggestions that his leadership position was no longer secure.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This deal was morally reprehensible and political malpractice. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Senator Schumer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job to keep the caucus together and fight for progressive values. He failed in that today,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The big blue wave that Schumer hopes will make him Senate majority leader in 2019 will not build itself.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Democracy for America, the political action committee founded by former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean, also said: \"If you want to know why we lost in 2016 and why a Democratic wave in 2018 is far from guaranteed \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 look no further than this weak and profoundly disappointing cave from Senate Democrats.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Members of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No, DREAM, No Deal\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d began stepping up their calls for Schumer and others to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stand strong\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Sunday night, when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., suggested a compromise had been reached, without offering any solid commitment.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When the Democrat filibuster of the government funding bill ends, the serious, bipartisan negotiations that have been going on for months now to resolve our unfinished business -- military spending; disaster relief; healthcare; immigration and border security -- will continue,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Assuming that the government remains open, it would be my intention to proceed to legislation that would address DACA.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Schumer, near the time of his announcement Monday, pledged his continued support for DREAMers, tweeting: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Soon, the govt will reopen, and we have a lot to do: #ProtectDreamers. Write a budget, Address health care, veterans, disaster relief, pensions & the opioid epidemic. The #TrumpShutdown will soon end, but the work goes on.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But by the time Republicans had the 60-plus votes, with support from 33 Democrats, the revolt was in full force.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Enough is enough,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Lorella Praeli, director of immigration policy and campaigns at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We cannot rely on empty promises from those who have already proven to play politics with the lives of Dreamers. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Let it be known -- we will be watching, and will make sure voters this November know if their representatives stood for Dreamers or for their deportations.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The short-term deal now only gives Congress until Feb. 8 to work out longer-term legislation, and an agreement on immigration.\n Trump tweeted Tuesday he's not sure it will happen.\n \"Nobody knows for sure that the Republicans & Democrats will be able to reach a deal on DACA by February 8, but everyone will be trying....with a big additional focus put on Military Strength and Border Security. The Dems have just learned that a Shutdown is not the answer!\" he said.\n",

Blake Farenthold Resigns After Sexual Harassment Allegations\n Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) is resigning from Congress, he announced Friday in a statement and accompanying video.\n Farenthold declared in December that he would not seek re-election in 2018 after reports emerged that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d used taxpayer money to settle sexual harassment claims. A few of his GOP colleagues urged him to resign over the accusations, which Farenthold has repeatedly denied.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While I planned on serving out the remainder of my term in Congress, I know in my heart it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for me to move along and look for new ways to serve,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said in the statement.\n In his video, flanked by an American flag and a Texas state flag, he added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You know, I look forward to staying in touch with everyone. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been an honor and a privilege to serve. Thank you so much. Please, stay in touch. I love y\u00e2\u20ac\u2122all.

He promptly deleted his Twitter and Facebook profiles.\n Farenthold used $84,000 in taxpayer funds to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit his former communications director, Lauren Greene, had filed in 2014, Politico reported in December. Greene accused Farenthold of telling her he had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sexual fantasies\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wet dreams\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d about her, and then claimed she was fired after complaining to Farenthold.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I had no idea how to run a congressional office,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the four-term congressman said in December. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a result, I allowed a workplace culture to take root in my office that was too permissive and decidedly unprofessional.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Farenthold said after the reports broke that he would repay the $84,000 to the Treasury Department, but has not made good on that promise. A representative for his office told HuffPost in February that the congressman was waiting to see what changes lawmakers will add to the Congressional Accountability Act.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He is waiting on the advice of counsel to see what final bill is enacted,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Bob Haueter, Farenthold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief of staff, told HuffPost at the time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Once the final bill is done and the law is changed and is complete and he can see that, he will make a determination of how he proceeds.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In his resignation statement, Farenthold reflected on his time spent working to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153make government more efficient and responsive, cut government spending, repeal Obamacare, protect life and reduce the debt.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would like to thank my staff both in Washington and Texas for all of their hard work on behalf of our constituents.

A lengthy investigation and multiple rounds of Congressional testimony failed to produce a shred of evidence that Special Agent Strzok\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal views ever affected his work,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Goelman said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In fact, in his decades of service, Special Agent Strzok has proved himself to be one of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top counterintelligence officers, leading to only one conclusion \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 the decision to terminate was taken in response to political pressure, and to punish Special Agent Strzok for political speech protected by the First Amendment, not on a fair and independent examination of the facts. It is a decision that produces only one winner \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 those who seek to harm our country and weaken our democracy.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Strzok exchanged texts with former FBI official Lisa Page that disparaged Trump as well as other politicians, including various Democrats. He testified last month after the release of an inspector general report on the handling of the FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hillary Clinton probe that described anti-Trump texts exchanged by bureau officials.\n Strzok, a 21-year veteran of the FBI, played a prominent role in both of the investigations surrounding the Clinton and Trump campaigns during the 2016 election. He was involved in the Clinton investigation, which was highly public, as well as the investigation into the Trump campaign and Russian interference in the 2016 election, which the bureau never publicly acknowledged until months into Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency. Strzok subsequently joined the Mueller team, but left the team as soon as Mueller became aware of his anti-Trump texts.\n The precise justification for Bowdich\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to fire Strzok despite the recommendation of the FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office of Professional Responsibility is unclear. But DOJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inspector general was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply troubled\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d by texts Strzok sent that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153potentially indicated or created the appearance that the investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and particularly focused on one anti-Trump text that implied a willingness \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to take official action to impact the presidential candidate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electoral prospects.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d The inspector general report also criticized Strzok for his use of personal email to conduct FBI business.\n It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible that the former FBI counterintelligence official\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extramarital relationship with Page also played a role in the FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision. Wray said at at a press conference in June that the bureau wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hesitate to hold people accountable for their actions\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d after the disciplinary process.\n Trump celebrated Strzok\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s firing on Twitter, writing Monday that the investigation into his campaign \u00e2\u20ac\u0153should be dropped\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and that the investigation into Clinton \u00e2\u20ac\u0153should be properly redone.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Mark Warner, top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, offered Trump an ultimatum for the highly anticipated summit: make Russian interference a priority, or cancel the meeting.\n Other Democrats said Trump should nix the summit regardless -- though they were raising concerns about the meeting even before the indictment.\n Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the charges during a Friday press conference. According to the DOJ document, 12 Russian intelligence officers are accused of hacking emails from the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic Party during the 2016 election.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I want to make sure that other Americans hear ... the president make this issue of Russian interference a priority in the meeting,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Warner, D-Va., told reporters on Capitol Hill Friday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make the indictments a priority in the meeting in Helsinki, then the summit should be canceled.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Warner, whose committee has been investigating Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in the 2016 election for more than a year, also stressed that there \u00e2\u20ac\u0153needs to be other Americans in the room\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d in Helsinki, Finland Monday to ensure that Trump makes the issue of interference in the 2016 election a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153priority.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There should be no one-on-one meeting between this president and Putin,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Warner said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There needs to be other Americans in the room, or the summit should be canceled.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He warned, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid the president could be taken advantage of.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But as Trump continues to describe the Russia probe as a \"witch hunt,\" the White House downplayed the latest allegations.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s charges include no allegations of knowing involvement by anyone on the campaign and no allegations that the alleged hacking affected the election result,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Lindsay Walters, the deputy White House press secretary. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is consistent with what we have been saying all along.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Within minutes of the indictment, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., urged Trump to call off the Putin meeting.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cancel the Putin meeting. Now,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Schumer tweeted Friday.\n Sen.

Call off this summit, @realDonaldTrump,\" Wyden tweeted.\n Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said Trump should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immediately cancel his meeting.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the stakes\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d for the summit \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could not be higher.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153President Trump must demand and secure a real, concrete and comprehensive agreement that the Russians will cease their ongoing attacks on our democracy,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Pelosi said in a statement Friday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Failure to stand up to Putin would constitute a profound betrayal of the Constitution and our democracy.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Presuming the meeting takes place as scheduled, Helsinki will be the final stop on Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s four-nation European tour.\n Trump spent the past week meeting with NATO allies in Brussels; meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May and Queen Elizabeth II in England; and visiting Scotland.\n",

Guess what? You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Trump said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can definitely do it with an act of Congress. But now they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re saying I can do it just with an executive order.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He said the right awarded to babies born as birthright Americans is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ridiculous\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and that the system \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has to end.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Trump also falsely stated that the U.S. is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the only country in the world\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d that offers citizenship to those born here. More than 30 nations, including Canada and Mexico, have similar policies.\n It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear what the executive order would look like or when it would be proposed \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 if Trump follows through at all, considering his tendency for pre-election bluster and warnings he has received from fellow Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.), who have said doing so would be outside the bounds the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authority.\n All babies born in the U.S. are American citizens under the Constitution\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 14th Amendment, which cannot be changed by presidential order.\n Changing that policy would dramatically reshape the U.S. \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 effectively punishing the children of undocumented immigrants, whom Trump has vowed to remove from the country. Even if he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t follow through or succeed, though, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vow to try aligns with other messaging and actions attacking undocumented immigrants ahead of the midterm elections next Tuesday.\n An executive order challenging birthright citizenship would ensure a legal battle, in which most experts think the president would fail. The Supreme Court ruled in 1898\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark that a child born in the U.S. to immigrant parents was a citizen under the 14th Amendment.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The president cannot erase the Constitution with an executive order, and the 14th Amendment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s citizenship guarantee is clear,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Immigrants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Rights Project. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a transparent and blatantly unconstitutional attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred in the days ahead of the midterms.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Some Republicans \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 including Ryan \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 quickly shot down Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s idea. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the House speaker said Tuesday on WVLK Radio, according to Bloomberg News reporter Erik Wasson.\n Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) criticized the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement, calling instead for immigration reform \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that makes our country more secure and reaffirms our wonderful tradition as a nation of immigrants.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Another Republican, Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, also tweeted that such an executive order would not be possible.\n The are some experts who disagree. Axios cited John Eastman, a constitutional law professor at Chapman University and director of The Claremont Institute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence, who said the amendment has been misapplied and was not intended to apply to every person born in the U.S. regardless of parentage.\n Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) announced Tuesday that he would introduce legislation \u00e2\u20ac\u0153along the same lines as the proposed executive order from President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d to end birthright citizenship, a policy change he has supported for years. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unclear what his legislation would look like \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 and he has previously suggested such a change would require a constitutional amendment.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This policy is a magnet for illegal immigration, out of the mainstream of the developed world, and needs to come to an end,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Graham said in a statement on Tuesday.\n Trump has long supported ending birthright citizenship, recommending in 2015 on the campaign trail that the country \u00e2\u20ac\u0153start a process\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d to scrap it.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they have American citizenship and if you speak to some very, very good lawyers \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and I know some will disagree \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but many of them agree with me and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to find they do not have American citizenship. Our country is going to hell,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Trump said then in an interview with CNN.\n The president has lasered in on immigration ahead of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s midterm elections, stoking fear about the caravan of migrants heading toward the U.S.-Mexico border from Central America. He has falsely claimed the caravan is stocked with criminals, gang members and Middle Eastern terrorists, and has threatened to cut off aid to Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, the countries where most of the migrants hail from.\n He deployed 5,200 active-duty troops to the border on Monday in what officials of his administration described as a necessary national security measure.\n",

Some top Democrats called on Mueller to release what his team knows about Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Moscow deal as a matter of public duty.\n In a strong statement issued Friday night, Sen. Dianne Feinstein joined a chorus of her Democratic colleagues in threatening serious action, including impeachment, against Trump if the allegations proved true. Feinstein is a ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve previously known about attempts to develop Trump Tower Moscow and the misrepresentations surrounding those efforts,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Feinstein said.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now, media reports say President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about that business deal,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Feinstein continued. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If true, the president committed a crime and must be held accountable.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Earlier Friday, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) revealed that his committee had already begun searching for witnesses and documents to confirm BuzzFeed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our committee is already working to secure additional witness testimony and documents related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal and other investigative matters,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Schiff said.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a counterintelligence concern of the greatest magnitude, and given that these alleged efforts were intended to interfere with our investigation, our Committee is determined to get to the bottom of this and follow the evidence wherever it may lead,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he added.\n Trump has maintained he is innocent and on Friday accused Cohen of lying to the special counsel in order to reduce his jail time.\n",

He said that the wall was why he was elected, one of the officials said.\n Democrats were equally adamant, according to another official who was present for the discussion. Pressed by Vice President Mike Pence and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the incoming minority leader, they refused to budge from their offer to devote $1.3 billion to border security. The official also insisted on anonymity to describe the private conversation.\n Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said after the meeting that he had no intention of putting Democratic bills to reopen the government to a vote if Mr. Trump would not sign them.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hopeful that, somehow, in the coming days and weeks, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be able to reach an agreement,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. McConnell told reporters at the Capitol, offering an ominous timeline.\n The events underscored the personal and political crosscurrents standing in the way of any compromise between a president unwilling to lose face with his core supporters on his signature campaign promise and newly empowered Democrats \u00e2\u20ac\u201d poised to assume control of the House on Thursday \u00e2\u20ac\u201d who refuse to give ground on an issue that has come to symbolize Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immigration policies.\n With the partial government funding lapse dragging into its 12th day and affecting 800,000 federal employees, the confrontation in the Situation Room only served to highlight the depth of the divide.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Could be a long time, or it could be quickly,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Trump said of resolving the shutdown. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too important a subject to walk away from.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who is in line to be elected speaker on Thursday, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are asking the president to open up government. Why would he not do it?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He could not give a good answer,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Schumer said.\n Mr. Trump tried creative ways to persuade the Democrats that they should support his wall. At one point, he said Ms. Pelosi should back it because she was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a good Catholic\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and Vatican City is surrounded by a wall, according to one of the officials familiar with the discussion.\n In her first legislative act as speaker, Ms. Pelosi plans on Thursday to bring up two bills to reopen the government. One would fund the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8, providing a month to break the impasse over border security funding, and a second would provide money for the remaining shuttered agencies and departments through September. The homeland security measure would devote $1.3 billion to border security measures, such as enhanced surveillance and fortified fencing, but not the wall.\n Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rejection of those measures left the prospects of a resolution at their dimmest since the shutdown began on Dec. 22. It also highlighted the difficulty of the current situation, in which Democrats, Republicans and even some White House staff members have found themselves trying to anticipate what Mr. Trump will accept.\n The president asked the congressional leaders to return to the White House on Friday to continue the talks, after Democrats had completed their leadership elections, according to an official who attended the meeting. A second official who attended said Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team believed it would be easier for Ms. Pelosi to negotiate once she was officially installed as speaker. Both insisted on anonymity to describe the private gathering.\n In a pair of evening tweets, Mr. Trump seemed to hold out hope of an agreement, writing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s get it done!\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But the path to such a deal is murky at best.\n Before he met congressional leaders on Wednesday, Mr. Trump publicly rejected a compromise that Mr. Pence floated privately with Democrats last month to stave off the government funding lapse, saying $2.5 billion in border security spending was insufficient. In the hours before a midnight deadline to avert a shutdown before Christmas, the vice president had broached that number, which his team has quietly continued to push in the days after parts of the government ran out of money.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No, not $2.5 billion, no \u00e2\u20ac\u201d we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re asking for $5.6\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d billion, Mr. Trump said during a cabinet meeting, hours before the Situation Room briefing.\n His rejection of the figure seemed to confirm the concerns of Democratic leaders who had questioned whether they could trust senior White House officials to broker any compromise that could then be rejected by a president who has often shifted his position at the last moment, especially when it comes to immigration.\n The larger figure referred to the amount Mr. Trump has demanded for the wall, which the House endorsed in a vote last month, but which failed to garner even majority support in the Senate, where it would need 60 votes to prevail.\n But inside the Situation Room later on Wednesday, the proposal resurfaced and Mr. Trump appeared open to it, according to one of the officials present, as Mr. Pence and Mr. McCarthy pressed Democrats to meet in the middle. Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer said $1.3 billion was their highest bid.\n Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gathering in the Situation Room, a secure chamber in the basement of the White House where military operations are tracked and other sensitive discussions unfold, was a conscious effort by Mr. Trump and his aides to infuse a sense of national-security crisis into the immigration discussion. It was the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first face-to-face meeting with Democratic leaders since a combative session last month when he said he would insist that any government spending bill include money for a border wall \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and would proudly own the consequences if that meant a shutdown.\n But it quickly turned tense as Mr. Trump argued for his wall and called on Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, who appeared via teleconference from the border in San Diego to stress the need for it, according to two of the officials who were at the meeting.\n Mr. Schumer interjected, calling on Ms. Pelosi, who disputed Ms. Nielsen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statistics, two of the officials said. Ms. Pelosi then laid out the legislative proposals she planned to bring up on Thursday, detailing how the spending measures had all received broad bipartisan support either in committees or on the floor in the Republican-controlled Congress.\n The back and forth drew an angry response from the Department of Homeland Security.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Democrats in the room either don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care that there is a humanitarian crisis on the border or just prefer ignorance,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement on Wednesday night. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was incredibly disheartening that they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to know the facts when making policy.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Yet hours before the meeting began, what was billed as a somber security briefing had already taken on the sharp tone of a political showdown, as Mr. Trump charged that Democrats were sacrificing border security for a partisan advantage in the 2020 elections.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The United States needs a physical barrier,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the president said during the cabinet meeting, comparing the southern border to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a sieve\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d that allows criminals and drugs to enter the country and facilitates human trafficking.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Walls work,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he added, claiming inaccurately that former President Barack Obama has one \u00e2\u20ac\u0153around his compound\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d in Washington. (Parts of Mr. Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home in the northwest section of the city are bordered by a low brick retaining wall, and others have iron or chain-link fencing.)\n Mr. Trump repeated his false claims about the border wall, including that Mexico was already paying for it, as he promised during his campaign, and that much of its construction had already been completed.\n Outside the White House, the search for a way out is getting more urgent. Some lawmakers have grown anxious about the shutdown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on their constituents, including federal workers who are not receiving pay while their agencies are denied funding.\n Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, wrote an opinion article in The Washington Post suggesting three ways out: Grant the president the $1.6 billion for border security that he requested, without wall funding, plus an additional $1 billion for security at ports of entry; approve a bipartisan bill linking wall funding with protection for young immigrants brought illegally to the country as children; or resurrect the 2013 comprehensive immigration overhaul that included huge increases in border security measures, sweeping changes to immigration law and a pathway to citizenship for the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 11 million undocumented immigrants.\n Incoming lawmakers vented new concerns about the shutdown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effect. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This morning I requested that my pay be withheld until the shutdown is over,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Representative-elect Mikie Sherrill, Democrat of New Jersey, said Wednesday on Twitter, where she posted a letter to the chief administrative officer of the House making her request official.\n She noted that thousands of federal workers in her state were not receiving paychecks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I came here to govern, not engage in partisan politics at the expense of hardworking Americans,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she said.\n",

It also serves as a campaign platform for Democrats ahead of 2020. It has virtually no chance of passing the Senate.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a power grab for the American people,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, who leads the House administration committee that shepherded the legislation.\n The ambitious compendium, at nearly 700 pages, includes proposals designating Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically registering citizens to vote, and restoring voting rights to people who have served felony sentences. It also creates a six-to-one matching system for donations of up to $200 to congressional and presidential candidates who reject high-dollar contributions, funded by an additional fine on corporations found to have broken the law.\n Republicans arguably have spent more time trying to define the bill \u00e2\u20ac\u201d called the For the People Act or H.R. 1, to underscore its primacy \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and tear it down than Democrats have spent trying to promote it. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has branded it the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Democrat Politician Protection Act\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d in weekly speeches, and pledged not to take up the legislation. The House Republican leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, also criticized the legislation.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This bill is a massive federal government takeover that would undermine the integrity of our elections,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. McCarthy said in a speech on Friday, in an attack on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this new, Democrat, socialist majority.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Some of the most debated provisions are intended to reveal who funds online political ads and finances so-called dark-money groups. The Disclose Act, part of the bill, would require super PACs and nonprofit organizations that spend money in elections to disclose the names of donors who contribute more than $10,000. Democrats say such disclosure is broadly popular with voters across the political spectrum.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Congress cannot meaningfully address the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significant challenges without first recognizing and acknowledging the undue influence of special interests in our politics,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Representative Abigail Spanberger, Democrat of Virginia.\n Some of those provisions, however, have drawn criticism from both conservative and liberal groups that argue the language is overly broad and would infringe on First Amendment rights. The American Civil Liberties Union urged members to vote against the bill.\n Democrats have also used the legislation to make clear that they believe that cleanup must start with the White House, and included several provisions jabbing at the president and homing in on a laundry list of his administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged ethical abuses.\n It would require presidents and vice presidents, as well as candidates for the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highest offices, to release at least 10 years of federal tax returns \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Mr. Trump has released none \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and it stipulates that inaugural committees must disclose their expenditures.\n And an amendment sponsored by Representative Raul Ruiz of California would prohibit federal funds from being spent at businesses owned or controlled by the president, the vice president or any cabinet official. Federal agencies spent about $13 million on four of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trips to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in early 2017, according to a report by a nonpartisan congressional watchdog agency issued last month.\n Two other measures also zero in on the costs of administration officials\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 travel. One provision would require the Defense Department to regularly report to Congress details of the costs of presidential travel; the other would prohibit political appointees from using federal funds to pay for travel on noncommercial or private flights for official business.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We must hold our government leaders to the highest standards, and with so many high-profile ethics violations in the past years, it is clear we have failed to do that,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Representative Tom O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Halleran, Democrat of Arizona and the sponsor of the amendments, said in a statement.\n Democrats also successfully put down an attempt by Republicans to divide the caucus and tar the legislation with a resolution expressing the sense that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting power of United States citizens.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Republicans have repeatedly ambushed Democrats \u00e2\u20ac\u201d twice successfully \u00e2\u20ac\u201d with politically freighted procedural motions in a drive to divide Democrats and draw out vulnerable swing-district members. But determined not to let that taint their signature legislation and fired up by a rousing speech from freshman Representative Max Rose of New York, Democrats held steady.\n",

Mueller III completed his report had barely begun when the panel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Republicans moved en masse to demand the resignation of the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman.\n It went downhill from there.\n The acrimony on display Thursday as the intelligence committee tried to resume its work on Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention in the 2016 presidential election laid bare the bitter divide that persists in Congress even after Mr. Mueller, the special counsel, completed his 22-month investigation of the subject. The Republican demand and the barbed response of the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff, echoed well outside the wood-paneled House hearing room.\n Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, spent much of his weekly news conference comparing Mr. Schiff, a fellow Californian, to Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, who fueled fears in the 1950s that Communist spies had infiltrated the American government. Representative Michael R. Turner, Republican of Ohio, played the same card in the hearing room, fuming that Mr. Schiff would not accept Attorney General William P. Barr\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s word that Mr. Mueller had not found the Trump campaign to have taken part in a conspiracy to undermine the election.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With McCarthyism,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d a senator was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chasing after Russian Communists,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Turner, an Intelligence Committee member, said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now we have Schiff chasing after Russian collusion.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Undaunted, Mr. Schiff made clear he was not about to step down, nor was he about to absolve President Trump or his campaign from nefarious conduct with Moscow \u00e2\u20ac\u201d especially without seeing Mr. Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report first. The Justice Department revealed on Thursday that the report came in at more than 300 pages, raising more questions about what information was behind the four-page summary released by Mr. Barr.\n Mr. Schiff had many questions of his own.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You might think that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s O.K. that the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son-in-law sought to establish a secret back channel of communications with the Russians through a Russian diplomatic facility. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s O.K. You might think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s O.K. that an associate of the president made direct contact with the G.R.U. through Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks; that is considered a hostile intelligence agency,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Schiff said, referring to Russian military intelligence and a Russian intelligence hacker.\n He continued: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You might think that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s O.K. that the national security-designate secretly conferred with the Russian ambassador about undermining U.S. sanctions. And you might think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s O.K. he lied about it to the F.B.I. You might say that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all O.K. You might say that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just what you need to do to win. But I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s O.K. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immoral. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unethical. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unpatriotic. And yes, I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corrupt.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Democrats who now control the House say that they will accept Mr. Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings, but as Mr. Schiff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monologue indicated they are increasingly determined not to let go of what they see as a deeply troubling pattern of wrongdoing by Mr. Trump, his businesses and his administration.\n That has in turn enraged Republicans, who have happily embraced what they call Mr. Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absolution of Mr. Trump. They say Democrats will stop at nothing to ruin his presidency, and bristle at Democrats accusing them of turning a blind eye to the Russian threat. And at the center of their wrath is Mr. Schiff, whose doughy-faced demeanor hardly evokes an attack dog.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The findings of the special counsel conclusively refute your past and present assertions and have exposed you as having abused your position to knowingly promote false information, having damaged the integrity of this committee, and undermined faith in U.S. government institutions,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Representative K. Michael Conaway, Republican of Texas, said to Mr. Schiff.\n Reading from a letter signed by every Republican member of the committee, Mr. Conaway added, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Your actions both past and present are incompatible with your duties as chairman of this committee.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Trump intervened as well, accusing Mr. Schiff of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d He \u00e2\u20ac\u0153should be forced to resign from Congress!\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the president wrote on Twitter.\n Mr. Schiff, clearly prepared for the ambush, argued that there was a difference between prosecutors proving a criminal conspiracy and the committee investigating evidence of foreign compromise. The committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own investigative work would go on, he signaled, though outside the hearing room he has indicated that work may well need to shift course once Mr. Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings are fully understood.\n Democrats backed him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153History will clarify what has happened,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut.\n Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California praised Mr. Schiff as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153calm, professional, patriotic,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and said his work as the chairman of the committee has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in stark contrast to the irresponsible and almost criminal behavior of the previous chair of the committee,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What is the president afraid of \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that he would go after a chairman of the committee?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just scaredy-cats. They just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what to do.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The party gave Mr. Schiff a more formal nod of confidence this week as well. On Wednesday, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, House Democrats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 campaign arm, announced that Mr. Schiff would serve as a key fund-raiser for the caucus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most vulnerable members to help put together a firewall to project the House majority.\n Out of the glare of the television cameras, Democrats are somewhat more circumspect.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the heat of the political moment just as the Republicans wanted to try to convict Hillary Clinton in the public sphere, Democrats probably contributed to the expectations that the outcome would be worse for the president than it was,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Himes said in an interview a day ahead of the hearing.\n Notably sitting out the fight was Mr. Nunes, whom Democrats have accused of many of the same abuses that Republicans accused Mr. Schiff of on Thursday and whose resignation they asked for last year. Mr. Nunes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sustained work last term to scrutinize the origins of the Russia investigation and accuse federal law enforcement officials of acting out of anti-Trump political bias sent convulsions through what in quieter times is one of Congress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more bipartisan bodies.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We should not be used as a platform to spread false information and bizarre conspiracies,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Nunes said on Thursday in brief remarks before deferring to Mr. Conaway.\n Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s showdown came, ironically enough, during a hearing with four subject experts on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Playbook: The Kremlin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Use of Oligarchs, Money and Intelligence in 2016 and Beyond.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Down the line, the witnesses warned that Vladimir V. Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Russia would only grow bolder in its efforts to destabilize western democracies, including the United States.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The bad news is that there is a new ideological fight between Putinism and the West, and it has only just begun,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Michael McFaul, an ambassador to Moscow under former President Barack Obama. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In my estimation, we as a country are underestimating it.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The whole episode offered a sharp contrast to the Senate Intelligence Committee, which with a yawning pace and no-leaks team has continued apace with its own Russia investigation. The committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chairman, Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, said this week that he aimed to finish witness interviews in the coming weeks and issue the last in a series of reports on the panel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings in the coming months.\n On Thursday, as Democrats and Republicans in the House traded recriminations, the Senate panel quietly called back for another interview with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son-in-law and senior adviser.\n",

It would dramatically expand voting access, create publicly funded House elections, enhance the transparency of money in politics, restore voting rights to millions of ex-felons, strengthen executive branch ethics law and end partisan gerrymandering.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a historic day, a pivotal day, a day that will make a difference,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said.\n The bill aims to answer rising attacks on voting rights from courts and politicians across the country, and also to stem the increasing inequality of campaign funding by empowering small donors with matching contributions from public funds, among many other things.\n The For The People Act \u00e2\u20ac\u0153takes power from the elites, special interests and the 1 percent and gives it to the American people,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) said.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This vote is an opportunity to be on the right side of history,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If not us, then who? If not now, then when?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n House passage of the legislation is the result of a long collaborative process by the Democratic Party to prioritize campaign finance and voting rights reforms. The party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Democracy Reform Task Force, endorsed by Pelosi and led by Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.), worked with lawmakers both old and new to bring together legislative ideas and craft them into a coherent package.\n Much of this work was begun while Democrats languished in the House minority. As a possible victory in the 2018 elections loomed, they made it clear that the reforms would be their No. 1 priority. This mission was driven not just by party leaders, but also by the candidates who would ultimately deliver Democrats their first majority in the House in eight years.\n One-hundred candidates, including those who won their 2018 races, signed a letter to Pelosi and other congressional leaders demanding the reforms be the first order of business. Many cited the endemic corruption of money in politics as a top complaint they heard on the campaign trail from constituents.\n The vote broke down on party lines, with Republicans in hardened opposition. During multiple committee hearings and floor debate, GOP representatives castigated the bill as a federal power grab designed to help Democrats win elections by allowing increased voting access and nonpartisan gerrymandering. They said the campaign finance disclosures and the public funding of elections assaulted free speech rights, the ethics laws were too broad and unnecessary, and the creation of a federal election day holiday was an unnecessary benefit for lazy workers.\n The Senate will not take up the bill, according to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\n McConnell is perhaps the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest opponent of campaign finance reforms, and the Republican Party has enacted measures across the country in the last decade to restrict voter access. Those restrictions would be overturned by the For The People Act.\n Still, Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) announced the outlines of a Senate companion bill on Wednesday. President Donald Trump has been advised to veto the legislation if it reaches his desk.\n Democrats believe that the reform package is popular and plan to vote on individual pieces of it to keep the issues of corruption and voting rights front and center. They are already pursuing a reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act in a separate bill. And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on Thursday that he would like to mandate automatic voter registration across the country.\n The House bill \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is just the first step in our efforts to change politics in this country \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 to change politics in this town,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d freshman Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.) said on Thursday ahead of the vote.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a fight that will not end until we win it,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Pelosi said.\n",

Adam Schiff step down as chairman over the California Democrat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s repeated claims to have evidence of Trump-Russia collusion.\n In a letter, obtained by Fox News and signed by every Republican on the committee, the lawmakers slammed Schiff for his claims in the media that there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more than circumstantial evidence\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. They repeated their demand in person during a feisty hearing Thursday morning.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Your actions both past and present are incompatible with your duty as Chairman of this Committee,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the letter stated. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have no faith in your ability to discharge your duties in a manner consistent with your Constitutional responsibility and urge your immediate resignation as Chairman of this Committee.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The letter follows the conclusion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe, which turned up no evidence of collusion between Trump campaign members and Russia during the 2016 presidential election.\n President Trump himself went even further than congressional Republicans Thursday morning, tweeting:\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Congressman Adam Schiff, who spent two years knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking, should be forced to resign from Congress!\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Another top Republican, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, also lambasted Schiff on Thursday - comparing the California lawmaker to director Oliver Stone.\n \"He's made some pretty outrageous comments that Mueller could not verify, Graham said. \"He's getting into conspiracy land and he's acting like an Oliver Stone type figure. That to me is not helpful to him but I'm not going to ask him to resign for Congress.\"\n Schiff, a vocal critic of the president, has doubled down on his claim that Trump and his administration colluded with foreign powers despite Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Undoubtedly, there is collusion,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Schiff told The Washington Post after Attorney General William Barr's four-page summary of Mueller's investigation was released Sunday. He told the paper that the question of whether Trump or the people around him were compromised by a hostile foreign power was not in any part of Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report.\n The letter to Schiff was sent as those same Republicans confronted Schiff at the start of a Russia-themed hearing Thursday morning.\n Rep. Michael Conaway, R-Texas, attacked Schiff for driving a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153false narrative\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d about collusion between Trump and Russia and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153undermining the faith\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d of the American people. Conaway then went on to demand Schiff immediately resign his committee chairmanship, saying that Republicans on the committee have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no faith in you.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Schiff defended himself during Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hearing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c pointing to evidence of Russian hacking during the last presidential election, that Russian operatives offered dirt on Hillary Clinton during the campaign and that members of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign and family took meetings with Russians.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You might think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s okay that they lied about the meeting,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Schiff said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s okay.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Schiff on Monday signed a letter with his fellow House committee chairs demanding the full Mueller report by April 2.\n House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said earlier this week that the mounting calls to remove Schiff were \"absolutely ridiculous.\" She consulted with Schiff and other committee leaders over the weekend as Barr notified Congress of Mueller's report and summarized the details.\n A Pelosi aide said Schiff was being attacked because he's done \"an outstanding job.\"\n \"Democrats aren't going to be intimidated by the White House or Congressional Republicans,\" spokeswoman Ashley Etienne said. \"We're not going to be distracted from securing the release of the full Mueller report and the underlying evidence, and we will continue to pursue legitimate oversight because that's what the Constitution requires.\"\n",

The president again suggested that he should win the Nobel Peace Prize, and he reviewed which conservative commentators had been supportive of him, while dismissing Ann Coulter, who has not.\n Sounding alternately defensive and aggrieved, Mr. Trump explained his failure to secure wall funding during his first two years in office when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress by saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was a little new to the job.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d He blamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certain people, a particular one, for not having pushed this faster,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d a clear reference to former Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, a Republican.\n Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assertions were replete with misinformation and, when challenged by reporters, he refused to accept statistics produced by his own government that conflicted with his narrative.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The numbers that you gave are wrong,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he told one reporter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fake question.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n On point after point, the president insisted that he would be proved correct. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People said, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTrump is crazy,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said at one point, discussing his outreach to Mr. Kim. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And you know what it ended up being? A very good relationship.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Trump acknowledged that his declaration of a national emergency would be litigated in the courts and even predicted a rough road for his side. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Look, I expect to be sued,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said, launching into a mocking riff about how he anticipated lower court rulings against him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll win in the Supreme Court,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he predicted.\n Indeed, Public Citizen, an advocacy group, filed suit by the end of the day on behalf of three Texas landowners whose property might be taken for a barrier. California and New York likewise announced that they will sue over what Gov. Gavin Newsom of California called the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vanity project,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and a roster of other groups lined up to do the same. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fortunately, Donald Trump is not the last word,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Mr. Newsom, a Democrat. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The courts will be the last word.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Among those predicting a flurry of judicial decisions against Mr. Trump was George T. Conway III, a conservative lawyer and the husband of Kellyanne Conway, the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s counselor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If he knows he is going to lose,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Conway, a vocal critic of Mr. Trump, wrote on Twitter, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153then he knows he is violating the Constitution and laws he has sworn to uphold.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The House Judiciary Committee announced Friday that it would investigate the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emergency claim, while House Democrats plan to introduce legislation to block it. That measure could pass both houses of Congress if it wins the votes of the half-dozen Republican senators who have criticized the declaration, forcing Mr. Trump to issue the first veto of his presidency.\n The emergency declaration, according to White House officials, enables the president to divert $3.6 billion from military construction projects to the wall. Mr. Trump will also use more traditional presidential discretion to tap $2.5 billion from counternarcotics programs and $600 million from a Treasury Department asset forfeiture fund.\n Combined with $1.375 billion authorized for fencing in the spending package passed on Thursday night, Mr. Trump would have about $8 billion in all for barriers, significantly more than the $5.7 billion he unsuccessfully demanded from Congress.\n The president opted not to tap hurricane relief money from Texas or Puerto Rico, an idea that had generated angry complaints from Republicans. But he expressed no concern that diverting military construction money would delay projects benefiting the troops like base housing, schools and gyms. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sound too important to me,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n Neither the White House nor the Pentagon had yet identified which projects may be shelved as a result, but Pentagon lawyers and other officials planned to work over the weekend to identify which construction funds would be diverted.\n The declaration also provided that land may be transferred to the Defense Department from other federal agencies or from privately purchased or condemned land. The next step would be to secure those lands, where the Pentagon would erect barriers. The declaration gives Patrick Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, broad latitude to carry out this process.\n Most Americans oppose Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emergency declaration, according to polls. One released this week by Fox News found 56 percent against it, including 20 percent of Republicans.\n Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desire for approval by Fox and other conservative news outlets was on display when he identified various pundits as supporters, naming Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Tucker Carlson and Rush Limbaugh, although he insisted that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t decide policy.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But Ms. Coulter, who has viscerally attacked Mr. Trump for caving on the wall, has clearly gotten under his skin. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know her,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said before quickly correcting himself. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I hardly know her. I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spoken to her in way over a year.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d He noted, though, that she was an early predictor of his election victory. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So I like her, but she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s off the reservation,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But anybody that knows her understands that.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Ms. Coulter fired back shortly afterward. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The only national emergency is that our president is an idiot,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she said on KABC radio in Los Angeles.\n White House officials rejected criticism from across the ideological spectrum that Mr. Trump was creating a precedent that future presidents could use to ignore the will of Congress. Republicans have expressed concern that a Democratic commander in chief could cite Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move to declare a national emergency over gun violence or climate change without legislation from Congress.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It actually creates zero precedent,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, told reporters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is authority given to the president in law already. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as if he just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get what he wanted so he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s waving a magic wand and taking a bunch of money.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Presidents have declared national emergencies under a 1970s-era law about five dozen times, and 31 of those prior emergencies remain active. But most of them dealt with foreign crises and involved freezing property, blocking trade or exports or taking other actions against national adversaries, not redirecting money without explicit congressional authorization.\n White House officials cited only two times that such emergency declarations were used by presidents to spend money without legislative approval \u00e2\u20ac\u201d once by President George Bush in 1990 during the run-up to the Persian Gulf war, and again by his son, President George W. Bush, in 2001 after the terrorist attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania.\n In both of those cases, the presidents were responding to new events \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and Al Qaeda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assault on the United States \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and were moving military funds around for a military purposes. Neither was taking action specifically rejected by Congress.\n In Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case, he is defining a longstanding problem at the border as an emergency even though border apprehensions have actually fallen in recent years, to 400,000 in the last fiscal year from a peak of 1.6 million in the 2000 fiscal year. And unlike either of the Bushes, he is taking action after failing to persuade lawmakers to go along with his plans through the regular appropriations process.\n The spending package passed Thursday by Congress included none of the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump demanded for 234 miles of steel wall. Instead, it provided $1.375 billion for about 55 miles of fencing. Mr. Trump signed the package into law on Friday anyway to avoid a second government shutdown after the impasse over border wall funding closed the doors of many federal agencies for 35 days and left 800,000 workers without pay.\n For weeks, Republicans led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky urged Mr. Trump not to declare a national emergency, but the president opted to go ahead anyway to find a way out of the political corner he had put himself in with the failed effort to force Congress to finance the wall.\n Mr. McConnell privately told the president that he would support the move despite his own reservations, but warned Mr. Trump that he had about two weeks to win over critical Republicans to avoid having Congress vote to reject the declaration.\n Mr. Trump was among those Republicans who criticized President Barack Obama for using his executive authority to spare millions of illegal immigrants from deportation after failing to persuade Congress to do so. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Repubs must not allow Pres Obama to subvert the Constitution of the US for his own benefit & because he is unable to negotiate w/ Congress,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Trump tweeted in 2014.\n But Mr. Trump sought to drive home the personal toll of illegal immigration, inviting to the Rose Garden several relatives of Americans killed by people in the country without authorization. Some of the relatives, known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153angel moms,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d stood up holding pictures of loved ones who had died.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Matthew\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death was preventable and should have been prevented,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d one of the women, Maureen Maloney, said in an interview after the event. Her son Matthew Denice, 23, was killed in 2011 in a motorcycle accident in Massachusetts after colliding with an automobile driven by an undocumented immigrant. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He should have never been here in the first place,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t here, it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have happened.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

On Wednesday, the Democratic leaders emerged from the White House after 90 minutes, unified on not giving in to Trump.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are now feeling the heat,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Schumer said.\n Pelosi, who is expected to return to the House speakership Thursday afternoon after eight years as minority leader, intends as her first action to pass spending bills that won Republican support last year to reopen the closed agencies.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re asking the president to open the government,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she told reporters on the White House driveway. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are giving him a Republican path to do that. Why would he not do that?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, though, said he will not take up legislation that Trump has not endorsed, which means the shutdown will continue.\n About a quarter of the federal government ran out of operating money at midnight Dec. 21 after Trump reneged on his commitment to a sign a short-term spending bill that had already passed the Senate on a unanimous vote. Trump changed his mind after Fox News and talk radio hosts ridiculed him for again backing down on his demand for wall money.\n Trump is now insisting that Congress appropriate $5.7 billion for that project, while Democrats want a short-term spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security and full-year funding for the other affected agencies while funding for the wall is negotiated separately.\n In the meantime, about 800,000 federal employees \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 about half furloughed, half deemed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153essential\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and required to work anyway \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 face real problems with their household finances. Many will miss their first paycheck on Jan. 11 unless Trump signs a spending bill before then. Employees would have to dip into their savings or borrow money to pay their bills, as there is no government program to help them.\n Trump, however, did not mention them during extended remarks he offered shortly before his meeting with the eight top Democratic and Republican congressional leaders.\n When asked how long the shutdown would last, the president replied, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As long as it takes,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d calling his wall, a signature campaign promise, a matter of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153national security.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments came at what was billed as the first Cabinet meeting of 2019. Instead, Trump spent the first hour and a half of it complaining about a variety of issues, such as former Defense Secretary James Mattis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 performance and the late Sen. John McCain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote against Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s repeal of Obamacare, as well as offering his musings on such things as the utility of wheels and his desire for Russia to invade Afghanistan again.\n Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks were riddled with falsehoods on everything from trade to the number of illegal immigrants in the country to the way NATO works.\n The White House did not respond to HuffPost queries about whether Trump understood that what he was saying was false and, if he did, why he was doing so anyway.\n Trump promised hundreds of times during his campaign that the wall would cost taxpayers nothing because he would get Mexico to pay for it. But since taking office, Trump has never asked Mexico for payment. Instead, he began threatening to shut down the government early last year unless Congress gave him billions of dollars to build it \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 even though the type of structure he wants remains unclear.\n During the campaign, he promised a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great, great\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d wall made of reinforced concrete that would rise 30 feet or more and extend so far underground that it would be impossible to tunnel underneath. In recent months, he has at times said the wall could just be steel slats, which would be like the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bollard fencing\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d developed during President Barack Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration.\n In a tweet Wednesday morning, Trump claimed, falsely, that Mexico was already paying for a border wall, thanks to a newly renegotiated trade deal, and that the wall was already largely done but he needed billions of dollars anyway.\n Despite numerous requests over several weeks, the White House has not provided any economic analysis to back up Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claims. Outside economists and trade experts, however, said the revisions in the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump has rebranded the United States Mexico Canada Agreement, will not bring in to the U.S. Treasury anywhere near what is necessary to pay for a wall. More important, what extra money does come in will be from tariffs, which are paid by people in the U.S., not Mexico.\n",

Mueller III, with several saying that Americans deserved to know any findings about President Trump, Russia and the 2016 election in order to form judgments about Mr. Trump and the 2020 race.\n Former Representative Beto O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Rourke, campaigning in South Carolina on Friday night, told reporters that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153those facts, that truth, needs to be laid out for all Americans to be able to make informed decisions going forward, whether at the ballot box\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d or in their discussions with their senators and representatives.\n Mr. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Rourke, asked if he supported impeaching Mr. Trump, said he believed the president and his 2016 campaign \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at least sought to collude with the Russian government to undermine our democracy\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and that Mr. Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sought to obstruct justice\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d once in office.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think those are grounds enough for members of the House to bring up the issue of impeachment,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But whether they do or not, this will ultimately be decided by the American public at the ballot box in South Carolina and in every state of the union.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n No voters brought up the Mueller report to Mr. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Rourke as he spoke to them Friday. Indeed, in the hours after the announcement of the report, Democratic candidates reacted over Twitter or in remarks at events rather than in back-and-forth conversations with voters.\n Several candidates, in calling for the swift release of the report, also sought to gather new supporters and their email addresses by putting out \u00e2\u20ac\u0153petitions\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d calling for complete transparency from the Justice Department.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Trump Administration shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to lock up Robert Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report and throw away the key,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Senator Cory Booker argued on Twitter, asking people to sign a petition and provide their names and emails. Such information is often used for future fund-raising solicitations.\n Within hours of Mr. Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s completing his investigation, Senator Elizabeth Warren and the campaign arm of House Democrats were already placing ads on Facebook demanding the full report\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s release, with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee seeking 100,000 signatures for its online petition.\n With no detailed information available about the report, Ms. Warren and Mr. Booker \u00e2\u20ac\u201d as well as Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris \u00e2\u20ac\u201d sought to focus attention and pressure on how quickly Attorney General William P. Barr would release the full report.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Attorney General Barr \u00e2\u20ac\u201d release the Mueller report to the American public. Now,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ms. Warren wrote on Twitter.\n Ms. Gillibrand made similar demands and also retweeted the news of the report along with three words: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153See you Sunday.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d That is when Ms. Gillibrand plans to formally kick off her 2020 campaign in front of Trump International Tower in New York.\n Ms. Harris, in addition to calling for the report to be released \u00e2\u20ac\u0153immediately,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d called on Mr. Barr to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153publicly testify under oath about the investigation and its findings.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Ms. Harris, Ms. Warren and Ms. Gillibrand also joined Mr. Booker and Senator Bernie Sanders in asking supporters to sign their petitions calling for the report\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immediate release.\n Four other candidates \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington; former Representative John Delaney; and Juli\u00c3\u00a1n Castro \u00e2\u20ac\u201d also called for the release of the full report.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As Donald Trump said, \u00e2\u20ac\u2122Let it come out,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Sanders wrote on Twitter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I call on the Trump administration to make Special Counsel Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full report public as soon as possible.

He indicated he was not shifting on his demand for more than $5 billion for funding for a wall on the southern border, saying it was necessary as the border is a \"dangerous, horrible disaster.\"\n \"This is national security we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not talking about games,\" he told reporters.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We're not playing games, we have to do it.\"\n Despite Trump saying conversations had \"come a long way,\" Democrats were more dour in their assessment.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer exited saying Trump told them \"he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Trump later confirmed in the Rose Garden, \"Absolutely I said that,\" while clarifying he hopes the partial shutdown doesn't last more than a few more days.  He said it could be opened \"very quickly\" if they come to an agreement on the wall.  He offered some flexibility only on what the wall would be made of, saying it could be concrete or steel.\n \"Steel is more expensive than the concrete, but I feel like we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about steel because the other side feels better about it,\" he said.\n Yet House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Democrats' view is that they cannot resolve the funding dispute until the government fully opens.  She said there had been progress only in the sense of a \"better understanding\" of each other.\n Looking for an elusive resolution, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Trump agreed to designate staff to engage in negotiations with congressional leadership aides this weekend.  Trump later said the group would \"determine what we're going to do about the border.\"  That group would include Vice President Pence and advisor Jared Kushner.\n The meeting came on the 14th day of the shutdown, which was triggered by disagreements over the funding of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promised wall, after Democrats formally took control of the House of Representatives.  Trump has said that $5 billion in funding for the wall is non-negotiable, while Democrats have said they will fund more general border security -- but not the wall.\n Trump met with Democratic and Republican leaders of both chambers.  Ahead of the meeting Trump sent a letter to members of Congress congratulating Pelosi on her election as speaker and calling on Congress to re-open the government.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As we begin this new Congress, our first task should be to reopen the Government and to deliver on our highest duty as elected officials: the security of the Nation and its borders,\" he said.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is the sovereign right of every nation to establish an immigration program in its national interest\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlawfully admitting those who have followed the rules, while denying entry to those who break the rules or fail to meet the requirements established in law.\"\n As part of his strategy, he made available to every member a presentation on border security that he said those present at a meeting Wednesday did not want to hear.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Americans have endured decades of broken promises on illegal immigration.  Now, is the time for both parties to rise above the partisan discord, to set aside political convenience, and to put the national interest first,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he wrote.\n Democrats, meanwhile, passed legislation in the House that would fund the whole government, but not the wall.   Pelosi accused Republicans of holding government workers hostage for the separate demand of a wall.\n \"The wall and the government shutdown really have nothing to do with each other,\" Pelosi said at an MSNBC Town Hall.\n \"There is no reason to have workers pay a price with their paycheck,\" she said\n The legislation was immediately dismissed by Republican leadership.  McConnell, R-Ky., called the bills \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a time-wasting act of political posturing\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a resolution will have to be palatable to House Democrats and Senate Republicans alike.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to make policy rather than simply making political theatre,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he told reporters.\n White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said on \"Fox & Friends\" earlier Friday that it would be up to Pelosi to get her party behind her, including the left flank pushing for impeachment.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think we're hopeful because the people that elected Nancy Pelosi didn't elect her to come up here and do nothing and didn't elect her to play political games,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she said.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They elected her to find real solutions and actually work with the president and work with all members of Congress to get things done.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n On Thursday night, Pence said on Fox News' \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tucker Carlson Tonight\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d that the terms of the negotiations were clear: \"Bottom line, if there's no wall, there's no deal.\"\n",

Bernie Sanders of Vermont, campaigning in San Francisco on Sunday, told the large crowd that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don't want a summary of the report! I want the whole damn report because nobody, especially this president, is above the law.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n And on Saturday, one day before Attorney General William Barr released a short summary of Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings, former Texas Rep. Beto O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Rourke charged on the campaign trail in South Carolina that you \u00e2\u20ac\u0153have a president, who in my opinion beyond the shadow of a doubt, sought to, however ham-handedly, collude with the Russian government \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 a foreign power \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 to undermine and influence our elections.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He did not comment at length on Sunday, but did say at a campaign stop in Las Vegas that Trump is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of the most racist and uncivil presidents we have ever had.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly two-year-long investigation did not establish that members of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2016 presidential campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government to interfere in the election in favor of Trump and at the expense of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-awaited findings also did not take a clear position on whether Trump obstructed justice, with no conclusions that the president committed a crime but also not exonerating Trump. Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Sunday concluded, though, that Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report did not contain sufficient evidence to establish that Trump committed obstruction of justice.\n America Rising, a pro-Republican opposition research group, took aim at O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Rourke, saying on Sunday after Barr\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement that the candidate made \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brazen and incorrect claims on the campaign trail.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Barr is expected to make public more of the report, but 2020 Democrats are demanding the full report be released.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Mueller report needs to be made public, the underlying investigative materials should be handed over to Congress, and Barr must testify. That is what transparency looks like. A short letter from Trump's hand-picked Attorney General is not sufficient,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Sen. Kamala Harris of California wrote on Twitter Sunday.\n Rourke demanded Barr \u00e2\u20ac\u0153release the full Mueller report to the American people and their representatives.\"\n Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts pointed to a recent unanimous vote by Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives to urge the release of the report.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Congress didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask for a 'summary,' Attorney General Barr. Members of the House voted 420-0 to release the report. The American people deserve to see the full report. #ReleaseTheFullReport,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she wrote on Twitter.\n Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey wrote that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153American public deserves the full report and findings from the Mueller investigation immediately\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot just the in-house summary from a Trump Administration official.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n It was a similar call from Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who tweeted that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153AG Barr's summary 4-pg letter of Special Counsel Mueller's investigation underscores that the ENTIRE report & documentation-including all information re Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to influence our election-need to be made public. The public deserves answers now-our democracy depends on it.\"\n And Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York also chimed in, demanding that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mueller report must be made public. Not just a letter from someone appointed by Trump to protect himself\u00e2\u20ac\u201dall of it. The President works for the people, and he is not above the law.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seen his campaign surge in recent days, also called for the entire report to be released. And in an interview on MSNBC, he pointed to the 2020 presidential election as the best way to oust Trump from the White House, saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think this is further evidence that it would be a mistake for Democrats to think that the way for the Trump presidency to end is by way of investigation.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland called for the report to be made public, but also urged that it was time to move on. He told Fox News Sunday night that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whether you're a Democrat, Republican or independent, you should want to see this report, and we should want to move on from this.\"\n",

      "text": "SOURCE: fox\n\nTITLE: FBI's show of force in Roger Stone arrest spurs criticism of Mueller tactics\n\nPUBLISHED: 2019/01/25\n\nThe FBI's pre-dawn arrest of President Trump's ex-adviser Roger Stone at his Florida home prompted critics to once again question the tactics of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, after more than a dozen special agents clad in tactical gear raided Stone's property Friday.\n Stone, 66, was taken into custody early Friday after being indicted by a federal grand jury a day earlier as part of Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election.\n CNN, which conveniently happened to be staking out Stone's Fort Lauderdale home, posted video of the arrest that showed a team of FBI agents with guns banging on Stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s door and demanding that he come outside.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the crack of dawn, 29 FBI agents arrived at my home with 17 vehicles, with lights flashing, when they could have contacted my lawyer,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Stone explained after a court appearance Friday.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the FBI agents were extraordinarily courteous.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Stone will appear on Fox News Channel's \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" on Friday at 8 p.m. ET.\n Stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorney added that the arrest was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spectacle.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A SWAT team, searching the house, scaring his wife, scaring his dogs\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit was completely unnecessary,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorney said.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A telephone call would have done the job, and he would have appeared.\n Mr. Stone has nothing to hide.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The arrest operation drew scrutiny on social media\u00e2\u20ac\u201deven from President Trump, who said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Border Coyotes, Drug Dealers and Human Traffickers are treated better,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and questioned \u00e2\u20ac\u0153who alerted CNN to be there?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n One federal law enforcement source told Fox News on Friday that the operation was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153standard\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d for a home arrest.\n The source told Fox News that home arrests typically take place early in the morning with a team of FBI agents in protective gear, adding that Stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s situation was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nothing out of the ordinary.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n A former senior Justice Department official, now-white collar criminal attorney with Ifrah Law, James Trusty, told Fox News that while common procedure in white collar cases would involve a federal prosecutor contacting the defendant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorney, Stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s charges could have sparked a different approach.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It shows that there is either a fundamental distrust of Mr. Stone, possibly due to the witness tampering charge, or that there was a real breakdown with his attorney,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Trusty said Friday.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The wild card here is that in charging Stone with a form of obstruction of justice, the Mueller team may view it differently than typical white-collar investigations.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the FBI and the Mueller team believe Stone has engaged in witness tampering, then there is a palpable distrust, which would make them err on the side of surprise, rather than a courtesy phone call.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The 24-page indictment released early Friday alleges that Stone worked to obstruct the House Intelligence Committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election by making false statements to the committee, denying he had records sought by the committee and persuading a witness to provide false testimony.\n The indictment does not charge Stone with conspiring with WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy website that published the emails, or with the Russian officers Mueller says hacked them.\n Instead, it accuses him of witness tampering, obstruction and false statements about his interactions related to WikiLeaks' release.\n But former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Joseph diGenova blasted the tactic as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outrageous.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am appalled that the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI have permitted a vindictive use of arrest in a non-violent case with a defendant who was willing to surrender,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d diGenova, who has informally been an adviser to the president throughout the Russia investigation, told Fox News.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is an abuse of power and it underscores the vindictive nature of it by the fact that CNN was alerted ahead of time.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For those of us who have been prosecutors and have prosecuted mob figures, drug dealers and terrorists\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthose are the people for whom these aggressive tactics are reserved.\n Not a Roger Stone.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Make no mistake,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was designed to be vindictive and intimidating.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n DiGenova likened the FBI arrest of Stone to the bureau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early morning raid last summer of the home of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\n Stone on Friday said he would plead not guilty to the charges leveled against him by the special counsel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team, and said he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153looks forward to being fully and completely vindicated.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I believe this is a politically motivated investigation,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Stone said Friday.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no circumstance whatsoever under which I will bear false witness against the president, nor will I make up lies.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Stone served as an adviser to Trump for years before Trump ran for president.\n He left Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign in August 2015, but maintained regular contact with and publicly supported the Trump campaign throughout the 2016 presidential election.\n Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation, which was initially ordered to look into the 2016 election, has gone on for more than a year and half.\n It has expanded to probe financial crimes of Trump associates before the election, conversations Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national security adviser had with the Russians during the transition and whether Trump obstructed justice with his comments and actions related to the probe.\n Twenty-six Russian nationals and three Russian companies have been charged with interfering in the 2016 presidential election.\n But none of the Trump associates connected to Trump have been charged with crimes related to collusion.\n Other convictions include former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, who both pleaded guilty to making false statements in 2017.\n Former campaign adviser Rick Gates in 2018 pleaded guilty and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted and later pleaded guilty in a separate financial crimes case dating back before the 2016 election.\n Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements in a case brought by Mueller in November.\n Alex van der Zwaan, a London-based lawyer, pleaded guilty to making false statements this year, and Richard Pinedo, a California man, pleaded guilty to identity fraud in 2018.\n",

Many used the same language in their critiques, accusing Trump of holding the government and federal workers \"hostage.\"\n House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., tweeted, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear from the President was any sympathy for the federal workers who face so much uncertainty because of the chaos of the #TrumpShutdown.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Before Trump made his announcement, Pelosi had called his anticipated proposal \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a non-starter.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For one thing, this proposal does not include the permanent solution for the Dreamers and TPS recipients that our country needs and supports.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n For his part, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, called Trump's proposal \"one-sided and ineffective.\"\n \"It's clear the President realizes that by closing the government and hurting so many American workers and their families, he has put himself and the country in an untenable position. Unfortunately, he keeps putting forward one-sided and ineffective remedies. There's only one way out: open the government, Mr. President, and then Democrats and Republicans can have a civil discussion and come up with bipartisan solutions.\"\n Schumer, D-N.Y., concluded, \"It was the President who single-handedly took away DACA and TPS protections in the first place \u00e2\u20ac\u201c offering some protections back in exchange for the wall is not a compromise but more hostage taking.\"\n House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer shared a similar sentiment, urging Trump and Sen. Mitch McConnell to \"stop holding government hostage and end the shutdown\" immediately.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The president must stop holding government hostage and end the shutdown so federal employees can get back to work serving the American people. There is no reason for Americans to be shut out of work and without a paycheck while negotiations take place on the best way to secure our borders,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n Hoyer said negotiation can progress after the government reopens.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the government open, we can negotiate an agreement to strengthen border security that both sides can support and that is in the best interests of the American people.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Another leading Dem, Sen. Kristen Gillibrand of New York, who announced her White House bid on Jan. 15 in an episode of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" said Trump's offer was a \"bad deal.\"\n Gillibrand tweeted: \"Trump ordered the end of DACA and TPS. Then he shut down the government. Now he's holding federal workers hostage, saying he'll temporarily give back what he took away -- only if we give him a pointless, ineffective wall he falsely promised Mexico would pay for. This is a bad deal.\"\n Then there was New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez's response. He bluntly accused Trump of forcing \"a pointless shutdown\" to pay for the border wall.\n \"This is about more than 800,000 Americans who are being held hostage by a President who has forced a pointless shutdown to pay for an expensive, ineffective wall. This is not about immigration. Dreamers and TPS recipients are not bargaining chips. It's unacceptable that after taking away DACA protections, eliminating the TPS program for thousands of immigrants and creating a humanitarian crisis at the border, President Trump is offering temporary solutions in exchange for a permanent wall.\"\n The Democratic senator also said \"a legitimate negotiation\" can proceed after the government is reopened.\n Fellow Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware slammed McConnell for refusing \"to meaningfully negotiate with Senate Democrats,\" but also called Trump's offer \"a first step toward comprehensive immigration reform.\"\n \"This senseless government shutdown is hurting millions of Americans, and its impacts are only getting worse. The President should re-open the government so that Republicans and Democrats in Congress can work with the White House to find a sensible solution on border security and immigration. I am confident that a reasonable compromise can be reached, but not while President Trump continues to keep significant parts of the government shut down and Leader McConnell refuses to meaningfully negotiate with Senate Democrats,\" he said.\n \"Some relief for Dreamers and an extension of Temporary Protected Status represent a first step toward comprehensive immigration reform, but more ideas from members of both parties should be taken up and debated. Republicans and Democrats stand ready to work toward a solution, but the fact remains that there is no reason to have large parts of the federal government shut down while we debate appropriate border security and immigration policies.\"\n Republican lawmakers, at the opposite end of the reaction spectrum, praised the president for his willingness to negotiate.\n Senate Majority Leader McConnell, for instance, commended the president \"for taking bipartisan steps toward addressing current immigration issues.\"\n In his statement, he said; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Compromise in divided government means that everyone can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get everything they want every time. The president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal reflects that. It strikes a fair compromise by incorporating priorities from both sides of the aisle.\"\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This bill takes a bipartisan approach to re-opening the closed portions of the federal government. It pairs the border security investment that our nation needs with additional immigration measures that both Democrat and Republican members of Congress believe are necessary. Unlike the bills that have come from the House over the past few weeks, this proposal could actually resolve this impasse. It has the full support of the President and could be signed into law to quickly reopen the government.\"\n Republican Whip Steve Scalise called on Democrats to match Trump's willingness to negotiate.\n \"The time for political games has long passed. Democrats must put their personal dislike of the president aside, end their obstruction, and finally come to the negotiating table. It's time Democrats do what is right for the functioning and security of our nation and agree to a deal that opens our government, and includes funding for a border wall and other measures to solve this serious immigration crisis at our southern border,\" he said in a statement.\n Also on the Republican side, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she was \"hopeful\" for a \"constructive debate\" with Democrats.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Compromise is not a sign of weakness \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sign of strength, particularly when hundreds of thousands of families are being harmed. The Administration, Senate Republicans, and Democrats must now resolve this stalemate before 800,000 federal workers and their families miss yet another paycheck, and our economy is further damaged,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she said.\n Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, whose views on the president and his policies have fluctuated, said Trump \"put forth a reasonable, good faith proposal that will reopen the government and help secure the border.\"\n He tweeted, \"I look forward to voting for it and will work to encourage my Republican and Democratic colleagues to do the same.\n Earlier, while speaking in Ogden, Utah, Romney said he did not understand Pelosi's position on border security.\n \"You (Pelosi) and your fellow Democrats have voted for over 600 miles of border fence in the past, why won't you vote for another few miles now? I don't understand their position, I really don't,\" the Republican senator said.\n Florida Sen. Marco Rubio took a positive view of Trump's proposed deal, like his fellow Republicans. He said Trump made \"a very reasonable offer\" and urged Democrats to work with him.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The way to end this shutdown is for both sides to make mutual concessions in order to reach an agreement. The president has made a very reasonable offer to extend DACA and TPS protections in exchange for the border security measures he supports. I hope that instead of choosing the road of endless obstruction, Democrats will decide to work with him to reach an agreement and end the shutdown,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n Likewise, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy called the president's immigration offer \"reasonable.\"\n McCarthy tweeted: \"President Trump has put forward a serious and reasonable offer to reform parts of our broken immigration system and reopen government. The moment now turns to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. The country is watching.\" \n",

Cohen, his longtime lawyer and fixer, to lie to Congress about his role in negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow.\n The rare public statement by a spokesman for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, challenged the facts of an article published by BuzzFeed News on Thursday saying that Mr. Cohen had told prosecutors about being pressured by the president before his congressional testimony.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153BuzzFeed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s description of specific statements to the special counsel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s congressional testimony are not accurate,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said the spokesman, Peter Carr.\n Before Mr. Carr\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement, the BuzzFeed report led to a flurry of reactions by senior members of Congress who said that the allegations, if true, could be grounds for initiating impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump.\n The president himself responded on Twitter late Friday, calling the special counsel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our Country!\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n A proven effort by Mr. Trump to pressure a witness to commit perjury would be one of the most damning revelations so far in the investigation into Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to sabotage the 2016 presidential election and could be the cornerstone of a case that the president obstructed justice to keep investigators at bay.\n Both the White House and lawyers for Mr. Trump vigorously denied the BuzzFeed report even before the special counsel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office weighed in.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Two words sum it up better than anything anybody else can say, and that is \u00e2\u20ac\u2122categorically false,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, told reporters on Friday.\n BuzzFeed News maintained that its report was accurate, its editor, Ben Smith, said after Mr. Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office disputed the account. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We stand by our reporting and the sources who informed it, and we urge the Special Counsel to make clear what he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disputing,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Smith said on Twitter.\n The statement by Mr. Carr, the special counsel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman, was unusual because it appeared to be the first time he had publicly challenged the facts of a news media account that had generated significant attention for its revelations about the president.\n The New York Times has not independently confirmed the BuzzFeed report. One person familiar with Mr. Cohen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s testimony to the special counsel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prosecutors said that Mr. Cohen did not state that the president had pressured him to lie to Congress.\n Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that his panel would investigate the BuzzFeed report and was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153already working to secure additional witness testimony and documents related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal and other investigative matters.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n If true, Mr. Schiff said, the allegations \u00e2\u20ac\u0153would constitute both the subornation of perjury as well as obstruction of justice.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas, another Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, wrote in a tweet that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if the @BuzzFeed story is true, President Trump must resign or be impeached.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Friday that the panel expected Mr. Cohen to be back to testify privately in early February.\n The report added another jolt to a chaotic week for the White House, which has had to fend off questions about recent revelations that F.B.I. counterintelligence agents began investigating Mr. Trump in 2017 and that Mr. Trump has tried to conceal the details from senior administration officials about his interactions with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.\n In a December court filing, prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller described how Mr. Cohen had repeatedly lied to Congress both about the length of negotiations over the Trump Tower Moscow deal and about Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s involvement in the project.\n Mr. Cohen had told lawmakers that the negotiations ended in January 2016 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d before the first presidential primaries \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and were never discussed extensively among executives of the Trump Organization. In fact, according to prosecutors, the discussions continued as late as June 2016, after Mr. Trump was the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\n They also said Mr. Cohen discussed the progress of the Moscow project with Mr. Trump more frequently than he had told the committee and had briefed members of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family about the negotiations.\n When he appeared in court to plead guilty to lying to Congress, Mr. Cohen said he had concealed his interactions with Russian officials and the fact that he asked Mr. Trump to travel to Russia to promote the deal because he wanted to support Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153political messaging.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n That day, Mr. Trump defended his role in the Trump Tower Moscow discussions, brushing aside concerns that he was advancing his business interests at the time he was hoping to become president. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was a good chance that I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have won, in which case I would have gotten back into the business, and why should I lose lots of opportunities?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he told reporters.\n Mr. Cohen drafted his statement to Congress in August 2017 along with Steven Ryan, his lawyer at the time, according to people familiar with how the testimony was put together. Mr. Ryan was working with lawyers for the Trump family as part of a joint defense agreement.\n At least one of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal lawyers saw Mr. Cohen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s congressional testimony before he delivered it in August and October 2017, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.\n Mr. Cohen initially repeated his false statements about the Moscow tower to prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller after he pleaded guilty in August to campaign finance violations and financial crimes. But he corrected himself during subsequent interviews and proved credible, the special counsel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office said in a December sentencing memo.\n Mr. Cohen said he initially lied because he did not want to contradict his congressional testimony, prosecutors said. Subsequently, he took care \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not to overstate his knowledge or the role of others in the conduct under investigation\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and provided \u00e2\u20ac\u0153useful information\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d about his contacts with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153persons connected to the White House\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d in 2017 and 2018, the special counsel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s filing said.\n That truthfulness was a departure from Mr. Cohen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pattern of deception throughout his professional life, according to a separate sentencing memo by federal prosecutors in New York, filed at the same time as Mr. Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Driven by greed, they said, he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153repeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Cohen was sentenced in December to three years in prison for lying to Congress, campaign finance violations and financial crimes. He said he took full responsibility for his crimes, but said he acted out of blind loyalty to Mr. Trump, who he said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153led me to choose a path of darkness over light.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n During his nomination hearing this week to become attorney general, William P. Barr was asked if the president would have committed a crime if he had coached a witness to testify falsely \u00e2\u20ac\u201d or not to testify at all.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Barr said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Under an obstruction statute, yes.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Federal employees will get back pay \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very quickly or as soon as possible,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said. Shortly after the announcement, the Senate and House both passed a resolution to reopen the government through that date.\n The announcement comes on the 35th day of the longest shutdown in United States history and is a clear cave by Trump, whose impasse over the budget stems from his demands for $5.7 billion in funds for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 a project Democratic lawmakers say is a firm deal-breaker.\n If funding for his border wall is not secured by the end of the negotiation period, Trump said he is prepared to shut down the government again or issue a national emergency declaration in order to get funding \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 a plan that would strip funding from disaster recovery efforts.\n Throughout the shutdown, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation has suffered across parties as airports have grappled with severe delays and federal workers have gone without paychecks, putting many at risk of losing their homes, defaulting on loans and missing other crucial payments.\n Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement comes a day after the Senate failed to pass his proposal to reopen the government with border wall funding in exchange for temporary legal protection for some undocumented immigrants.\n House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was in the middle of a roundtable with Capitol Hill reporters when reports began surfacing of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support for a short-term government funding bill. She was mum on whether she considered his proposal a final deal.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going in that direction but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not to that place,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Pelosi. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m hopeful.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) spoke on the Senate floor shortly after Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement, congratulating lawmakers on the development.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The solution to this impasse was to separate funding the government from our disagreements over border security,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Schumer said, adding that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we can never hold American workers hostage again.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Trump spent most of his speech on Friday rehashing his usual talking points about crime at the border.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We really have no choice but to build a powerful wall or a steel barrier,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n",

Mueller III, revealed on Friday the most direct link yet between parallel efforts by the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks to damage Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election using Democratic Party material stolen by Russians.\n A top Trump campaign official dispatched Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to President Trump, to get information from WikiLeaks about the thousands of hacked Democratic emails, according to an indictment. The effort began weeks after Democratic officials publicly accused Russian intelligence operatives of the theft, which was part of Moscow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broad campaign to sabotage the 2016 presidential race.\n The indictment made no mention of whether Mr. Trump played a role in the coordination, though Mr. Mueller did leave a curious clue about how high in the campaign the effort reached: A senior campaign official \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was directed\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d by an unnamed person to contact Mr. Stone about additional WikiLeaks releases that might damage the Clinton campaign, according to the court document.\n In an indictment filled with colorful details about clandestine meetings, angry texts \u00e2\u20ac\u201d even a reference to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Godfather: Part II\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Mr. Stone was charged with seven counts, including obstruction, making false statements and witness tampering. Mr. Mueller did not say that Mr. Stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interactions with WikiLeaks were illegal, nor that the Trump campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with the organization.\n F.B.I. agents arrested Mr. Stone before dawn, appearing at his Fort Lauderdale, Fla., home with ballistic vests and guns drawn. Agents typically use those tactics as a precaution to secure possible evidence and protect themselves in case a suspect fights arrest. Prosecutors sealed details of the case because they feared that public disclosure would increase the risk of Mr. Stone fleeing or destroying or tampering with evidence, according to court documents.\n F.B.I. agents were also seen carting hard drives and other evidence from Mr. Stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apartment in Harlem, and his recording studio in South Florida was also raided.\n Mr. Stone appeared briefly on Friday morning in Federal District Court in Fort Lauderdale, his ankles and waist shackled in front of a packed courtroom. A man known for his dapper wardrobe was dressed simply in a navy blue cotton polo shirt, bluejeans and his trademark round, black-rimmed glasses.\n Afterward, in a theatrical appearance outside the courthouse, Mr. Stone vowed to beat what he called politically motivated charges. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no circumstance whatsoever under which I will bear false witness against the president, nor will I make up lies to ease the pressure on myself,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I look forward to being fully and completely vindicated,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he added, then flashed twin V-for-victory hand signs reminiscent of his political hero, former President Richard M. Nixon. In a brief interview later, Mr. Stone said he will plead not guilty, and people close to him have predicted that Mr. Trump could pardon Mr. Stone should he be convicted of any of the charges.\n The indictment is the first in months by Mr. Mueller, who is investigating Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interference in the 2016 election and possible coordination with Trump associates. Citing details in emails and other forms of communications, the indictment suggested that Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign knew about additional stolen emails before they were released and asked Mr. Stone to find out about them.\n According to the indictment, between June and July 2016, Mr. Stone told \u00e2\u20ac\u0153senior Trump campaign officials\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d about the stolen emails in WikiLeaks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 possession that could be damaging to Mrs. Clinton. On July 22 that year, WikiLeaks released its first batch of Democratic emails. After that, according to the indictment, the Trump campaign sought more.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A senior Trump campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information Organization 1 had regarding the Clinton campaign,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the indictment said, referring to WikiLeaks.\n The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, sought to broadly distance Mr. Trump from the charges. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The charges brought against Mr. Stone have nothing to do with the president,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she told CNN. Asked whether he directed a campaign aide to contact Mr. Stone about the WikiLeaks emails, she repeated that the charges did not involve Mr. Trump.\n A self-described dirty trickster, Mr. Stone began his career as a Nixon campaign aide and has a tattoo of Nixon on his back. He has spent decades plying the political dark arts \u00e2\u20ac\u201d including scandal-mongering \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to help influence American election campaigns, and has long maintained that he had no connection to Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.\n He sometimes seemed to taunt American law enforcement agencies, daring them to find hard evidence to link him to Moscow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interference; it is illegal for a political campaign to accept foreign aid. His brash behavior made him less of a subject of news media scrutiny than other current and former aides to President Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u201d like the character in a whodunit whom readers immediately dismiss as too obvious to have committed the crime.\n The indictment does not mention whether Mr. Stone or any other Trump associate knew about the Russian operatives\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 plans before they hacked the Democrats.\n In social media posts and interviews during the 2016 presidential race, Mr. Stone indicated that he had advance knowledge that a trove of information damaging to Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign might be about to spill into public view, and even suggested that he had personally spoken to the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange.\n Mr. Stone has changed his story as investigators closed in, saying that he was not actually speaking to Mr. Assange and that he had no direct knowledge that Russians were responsible for the Democratic hacking. Still, it was revealed last year that, in the weeks before the election, Mr. Stone was messaging on Twitter with Guccifer 2.0, a pseudonym used by one or more operatives in the Russian intelligence scheme to steal the emails and funnel them to WikiLeaks.\n Three senior Trump campaign officials told Mr. Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team that Mr. Stone created the impression that he was a conduit for inside information from WikiLeaks, according to people familiar with their witness interviews. One of them told investigators that Mr. Stone not only seemed to predict WikiLeaks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 actions, but also that he took credit afterward for the timing of its disclosures that damaged Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s candidacy.\n In October 2016, Mr. Stone exchanged emails with Stephen K. Bannon, then the chief executive of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign. In one exchange, Mr. Stone wrote that more WikiLeaks disclosures were forthcoming, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a load every week going forward,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d according to the indictment. Mr. Bannon appears to be the official described in the court document as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the high-ranking Trump Campaign official,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d based on previous disclosures about the email exchange.\n A day before Mr. Stone and Mr. Bannon emailed about WikiLeaks, Donald Trump Jr. exchanged messages on Twitter with the WikiLeaks account and asked, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behind this Wednesday leak I keep reading about.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n At the end of that week, on Oct. 7, WikiLeaks released more than 6,000 emails related to John D. Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign. The release, 30 minutes after The Washington Post published a recording of Mr. Trump bragging about assaulting women, appeared aimed at redirecting negative attention from Mr. Trump to the Clinton campaign.\n The special counsel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigators spent months encircling Mr. Stone, and the indictment unsealed on Friday detailed how he relied on several longtime associates to get information about the timing and content of WikiLeaks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 document releases in the months before the election.\n They pored over his testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The indictment documented numerous lies to lawmakers about his efforts to set up a back channel to WikiLeaks, and about his efforts to pressure other witnesses to lie.\n He exchanged heated texts with Randy Credico, a New York radio host with his own contacts with WikiLeaks, pressuring Mr. Credico to lie to the Intelligence Committee so that his story would line up with Mr. Stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.\n Mr. Stone told Mr. Credico he should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFrank Pentangeli\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d before the House committee, the indictment said, a reference to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Godfather\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d character who lies to Congress about his interactions with the Mafia.\n The tumultuous relationship between Mr. Stone and Mr. Trump goes back decades, with Mr. Stone serving as an informal adviser as Mr. Trump considered running for president several times.\n When Mr. Trump formally announced during the spring of 2015 that he was running for president, Mr. Stone was one of the first to join his campaign. Within months, however, the two had a public dispute and Mr. Stone left the team. But they have remained close, speaking often by telephone.\n On Friday, the day that Mr. Stone stood on the steps of a courthouse and pledged his enduring loyalty to the president, Mr. Trump bashed the investigation that had led armed federal agents to his friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house in the morning darkness.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greatest Witch Hunt in the History of our Country!\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he wrote on Twitter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153NO COLLUSION!\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

It institutes a public financing system for congressional campaigns, requires presidential candidates to disclose tax returns and makes Election Day a federal holiday.\n The House approved the plan 234-193. But the measure is not expected to succeed in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said the bill is dead on arrival.\n The American Civil Liberties Union, in a recent letter to Congress, encouraged lawmakers to vote against the bill because of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153provisions that unconstitutionally impinge on the free speech rights of American citizens and public interest organizations.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They will have the effect of harming our public discourse by silencing necessary voices that would otherwise speak out about the public issues of the day,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the ACLU wrote.\n One concern of civil libertarians is the bill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inclusion of the DISCLOSE ACT, which would require all organizations that spend money on elections to disclose donors.\n The ACLU said it supports making organizations report spending for public communications like TV ads that expressly call for the election or defeat of a candidate for office, but it worries the DISCLOSE ACT goes beyond that.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These standards are unclear and entirely subjective, which will lead to confusion and, ultimately, less speech,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the ACLU said.\n Republicans called the bill a Democratic power grab that amounts to a federal takeover of elections.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now, instead of getting money out of politics, the Democrats on this committee voted to pass a bill that will publicly fund \u00e2\u20ac\u201c campaign travel, campaign dinners, and in some cases, the politicians themselves,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Illinois Rep. Rodney Davis wrote in an op-ed for The Hill.\n The White House said in a statement that the Democrats' plan would \"micromanage\" elections that now are run largely by states and would establish \"costly and unnecessary program to finance political campaigns.\"\n But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the bill \"restores the people's faith that government works for the public interest, the people's interest, not the special interests.\"\n Trying to turn Republicans' words against them, Pelosi said, \"Yes it is a power grab -- a power grab on behalf of the people.\"\n House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California said the legislation would undermine the integrity of elections by allowing convicted felons to vote, and would apply a one-size-fits-all standard to elections now run by states and local governments.\n Democrats called that a mischaracterization.\n To Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., the bill \"grabs power away from the elites and the power brokers and gives it to the people.\"\n She and other Democrats disputed the claim that taxpayers will pay for campaigns, noting that money for political campaigns would come from a surcharge on federal settlements made with banks and corporations that run afoul of the law.\n",

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., had also suggested that a three-week continuing resolution could be the way forward.\n \"If they come to a reasonable agreement, I would support that,\" Trump told reporters.\n The partial closure of the government has led to hundreds of thousands of workers furloughed or working without pay, with groups representing the workers increasing their calls for D.C. to end the deadlock and get workers paid again.\n Many workers missed their second paycheck on Friday.\n Every former secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, including former White House chief of staff John Kelly, sent a letter to the president and Congress on Thursday asking them restore the department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s funding.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153DHS employees who protect the traveling public, investigate and counter terrorism, and protect critical infrastructure should not have to rely on the charitable generosity of others for assistance in feeding their families and paying their bills while they steadfastly focus on the mission at hand,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the letter said.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is unconscionable.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n President Trump on Saturday announced a compromise plan that funded the wall while extending protections for 700,000 illegal immigrants brought to the country as children and 300,000 immigrants from countries designated unsafe to return.\n However, Democrats rejected the plan even before Trump announced it, and a Senate version of the plan failed to get the 60 votes needed on Thursday.\n A second bill, already passed by the Democrat-controlled House to re-open the government, also fell short.\n On Thursday, Trump had promised that Republicans \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will not cave\" on border wall demands.\n \n",

Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected it even before Mr. Trump spoke, and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, denounced the offer as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not a compromise but more hostage taking.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n With the shutdown entering its fifth week and polls showing a majority of the public blaming Mr. Trump, the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advisers have been searching for an exit strategy. Saturday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech grew out of talks that Vice President Mike Pence and the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, have had in recent days with lawmakers including Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader.\n The proposal was Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first public offer to Democrats since the partial shutdown began nearly a month ago. It came after an acrimonious week of tit-for-tat politics, in which Ms. Pelosi told the president he could not deliver his State of the Union address in the Capitol until the shutdown was over, and the president retaliated by grounding a plane that was supposed to take Ms. Pelosi on a fact-finding mission to Afghanistan.\n In casting the plan as a compromise, the president sought to shift pressure to Democrats \u00e2\u20ac\u201d who have repeatedly refused to give Mr. Trump any money for his border wall \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to end the shutdown. But Democrats continued to insist they will not negotiate with Mr. Trump over border security until the government reopens.\n Over the course of his administration, Mr. Trump has repeatedly sought to curb both legal and illegal immigration. He has revoked Temporary Protected Status, or T.P.S., which offers crucial protections for immigrants, for people from some Latin American and African countries. And he has moved to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, an Obama-era program that shielded the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation.\n In the deal he outlined on Saturday, Mr. Trump offered to restore T.P.S. protection for 300,000 people, and said he would allow 700,000 Dreamers to keep their protections for three more years in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That is our plan,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Trump said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Border security, DACA, T.P.S. Many other things. Straightforward, fair, reasonable and common sense with lots of compromise.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d The proposal, Mr. Trump added, was intended to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153break the logjam and provide Congress with a path forward.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The speech was the second time during the shutdown that the president addressed the nation about the immigration crisis. But unlike his first address, a prime-time broadcast from the Oval Office that leaned heavily on dark messaging about the dangers of crime and illegal drugs flowing across the border, Mr. Trump seemed on Saturday to soften his tone.\n He paired the address with his first naturalization ceremony at the White House, a move intended to underscore the idea that he supports legal immigration. And his language was markedly different; instead of insisting on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big beautiful wall\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he promised during his 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump took care to use the word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153barrier\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d as well \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and seemed to pare back his vision for it.\n Calling the wall \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a powerful and beautifully designed see-through steel barrier on our southern border,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Trump said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea. These are steel barriers in high priority locations. Much of the border is already protected by natural barriers such as mountains and water.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Mr. Trump noted that he had adopted some Democratic proposals on border security. The president proposed $800 million for humanitarian assistance and $805 million for drug detection technology, in addition to funding for 2,750 more border agents and law enforcement officials and 75 new immigration judge teams.\n In her talking points, issued to Democrats, Ms. Pelosi said her party favored \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new drug, weapons and contraband scanning technology at official ports of entry,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153filling the more than 3,000 vacancies for customs officers.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ms. Pelosi also intends to bring up legislation in the coming days that includes an additional $1 billion for border security, including $563 million for 75 new immigration judges and support staff.\n Even so, Democrats roundly criticized the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan. They were particularly incensed that Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer extended protections to Dreamers and T.P.S. recipients that he himself revoked. And they said the deal was a nonstarter because it did not offer any permanent protections for Dreamers.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s simply more fake promises raising false hopes,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It will fool few Americans because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s neither serious nor credible as a real remedy for Dreamers.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Some on the right also pushed back, describing the proposal as amnesty. James Carafano, a national security expert at the Heritage Foundation who worked on Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transition, was among the critics. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Amnesty encourages further illegal immigration, incentivizes the tragedy of human trafficking and undermines our citizens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 confidence in the rule of law,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n Mr. Pence, briefing reporters after Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks, said the speech reflected a painstaking process of listening to lawmakers, including rank-and-file Democrats who made it clear they believed that protections for DACA and T.P.S. recipients must be included in a border security deal.\n And he pushed back forcefully against critics like Mr. Carafano who said the measure amounted to an unacceptable amnesty for undocumented immigrants.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no pathway to citizenship in this proposal,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Pence said.\n But that was one reason many Democrats considered it unacceptable. Other senior administration officials made it clear that part of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy was to try to drive a wedge within the party between those who want to hold out for a much more generous solution and those who may feel enough political pressure to end the shutdown that they will feel obliged to support it.\n Noting that Tuesday is the deadline for the government to reopen in time to prevent federal employees from going a second consecutive pay period without a check, Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, said Senate Democrats had a tricky decision to make. He also noted that the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to declare a national emergency was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d still a tool available to Mr. Trump to find funds to build the wall if a legislative agreement could not be reached.\n Now it will be up to Mr. McConnell to put legislation incorporating Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal on the Senate floor.\n Mr. McConnell \u00e2\u20ac\u201d who has insisted he will not put any legislation on the floor unless the president will sign it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d spoke to Mr. Trump, Mr. Kushner and Mr. Pence on Thursday night about finding a way forward.\n Mr. McConnell told the president that before he could bring up legislation on the Senate floor, he needed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153public reassurance\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d that Mr. Trump would sign it, one person close to the talks said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive discussions.\n The president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strikes a fair compromise by incorporating priorities from both sides of the aisle,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. McConnell said in a statement after Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech.\n If Mr. McConnell does indeed put a bill on the floor, as the president said he would, Senate Democrats will have to decide whether to block it or let it come up for a vote. Despite Democrats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vow to reject the measure, it could create an opening for negotiations between the two sides.\n The shutdown stalemate is creating increasing nervousness on Capitol Hill, especially among Republicans seeking re-election in Democratic-leaning states. One of them, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, is among only a handful of Republicans who have broken with the president and called for the government to reopen without a border security deal.\n On Saturday, she praised the president, saying she hoped that Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lead to constructive debate that will end this impasse.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n White House aides and allies of Mr. Trump said Saturday that Mr. Trump succeeded in ratcheting up the political pressure on Ms. Pelosi, especially if the Senate succeeded in passing a bill.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Democrats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 talking points have been that the president is solely responsible for shutting down the government,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Marc Short, the former White House legislative director, said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This puts more onus on them to come back and say why this proposal is insufficient.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But one reason Democrats are so leery of the deal is that they have been down this road with the president before. Last year, Mr. Trump and Mr. Schumer negotiated $25 billion in wall money for a pathway to citizenship for the Dreamers. But that deal fell apart when hard-line White House advisers persuaded the president to back away.\n The standoff over the shutdown, some former aides noted, was the first time Mr. Trump has had to engage in meaningful, high-stakes negotiations. But even that has come as a last resort, in what some have likened to negotiating out of desperation after failing to score political points.\n",

The national emergency declaration gives Trump a chance to reroute other government money to fund the project \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 and sets up a legal battle that could tie up the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s signature project for months or years.\n To justify the wall, Trump repeatedly insisted criminals, gang members and drug traffickers were pouring over the border and that only a wall could stop them.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have far more people trying to get into our country today than probably ever before,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Trump said.\n In fact, arrests for illegal border crossings are at their lowest levels since the 1970s. There were roughly 520,000 arrests for unauthorized border crossings last year, which is about one-third of the 1.6 million arrests that happened in 2000. Since 2014, a high proportion of those crossing have been Central American children and families seeking to make humanitarian claims such as asylum.\n The total wall funding will now come to about $8 billion, partially approved by Congress but mostly by Trump alone. That will buy the administration some 234 miles of border wall, a senior administration official told reporters Friday.\n The national emergency declaration will allow the Trump administration to use about $3.6 billion from Defense Department construction projects to build the wall, along with another $2.5 billion the department had allocated for counter-drug activities, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters.\n The Trump administration also plans to take executive action to move about $200 million from the Department of Homeland Security and another $600 million from the Treasury Department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s asset forfeiture account.\n None of the money will come from hurricane relief, Mulvaney said.\n The DHS funding bill included restrictions on where new border wall could be constructed. Those restrictions won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t apply to the portions built with national emergency money, a senior administration official said.\n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced Thursday on the Senate floor that Trump planned to sign the bill and declare a national emergency at the same time, adding that he supported the decision. Congress passed a government funding bill Thursday evening.\n McConnell warned Trump in private that declaring an emergency would spark a backlash among Republicans, according to The Washington Post.\n A national emergency declaration grants a president the ability to circumvent certain government rules so that an administration can respond to a crisis. In this case, Trump is sidestepping Congress so that he can gain access to certain federal funds without congressional approval.\n Administration officials cited dozens of previous national emergency declarations, insisting that Trump would not break with historical precedent by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unlocking\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d new pots of money for the border wall he seeks.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as if he just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get what he wanted so he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s waving a magic wand and taking a bunch of money,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mulvaney said.\n The move is almost certain to be challenged in court.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any crisis on our border is of President Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own making: family separations, child detention, turning our backs on asylum seekers, and more. There is no national emergency,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who has sued the Trump administration multiple times, said in a statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If Trump oversteps his authority and abandons negotiations with Congress by declaring a fabricated national emergency, we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t only call his bluff, we will do what we must to hold him accountable.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Prior to the declaration, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the proclamation a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gross abuse of the power of the presidency\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and vowed that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Congress will defend our constitutional authorities.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n For two months, Democrats in Congress have been enmeshed in stalled negotiations with Trump as he refused to accept anything less than $5.7 billion in the federal budget for his border wall. The stalemate caused a record-breaking partial government shutdown that forced an estimated 800,000 government employees to go without pay for 35 days.\n Trump reopened the government for three weeks on Jan. 25, allowing government workers to get back to work as border security negotiations continued.\n In January, Trump asserted that he had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the absolute right to declare a national emergency,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d according to CNN. He called it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the easy route\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d while insisting that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather Congress approve his border wall funding.\n",

Mr. Trump signed it on Friday night, restoring normal operations at a series of federal agencies until Feb. 15 and opening the way to paying the 800,000 federal workers who have been furloughed or forced to work without pay for 35 days.\n The plan includes none of the money for the wall that Mr. Trump had demanded and was essentially the same approach that he rejected at the end of December and that Democrats have advocated since, meaning he won nothing concrete during the impasse.\n Mr. Trump presented the agreement with congressional leaders as a victory anyway, and indicated in a speech in the Rose Garden that his cease-fire may only be temporary: If Republicans and Democrats cannot reach agreement on wall money by the February deadline, he said that he was ready to renew the confrontation or declare a national emergency to bypass Congress altogether.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We really have no choice but to build a powerful wall or steel barrier,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Trump said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down on Feb. 15, or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and Constitution of the United States to address this emergency.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But Mr. Trump has already adopted some of the language that his Democratic adversaries have used during the longest shutdown in history. He conceded that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we do not need 2,000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shining sea \u00e2\u20ac\u201d we never did\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and invoked the utility of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153smart walls\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d that substitute some physical barriers for drones and other sensors. The semantic evolution provides both the president and Democrats with a face-saving way forward if they want it.\n The surprise announcement was a remarkable surrender for a president who made the wall his nonnegotiable condition for reopening the government and a centerpiece of his political platform. Some immigration hard-liners that make up a key part of his political base were incensed by the capitulation.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Good news for George Herbert Walker Bush: As of today, he is no longer the biggest wimp ever to serve as President of the United States,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the commentator Ann Coulter, who has aggressively pushed Mr. Trump to keep his campaign promise on the wall, wrote on Twitter.\n On Capitol Hill, though, jittery lawmakers from both parties greeted the news with relief. Mr. Trump relented as the effects of the shutdown were rippling with ever greater force across the economy, with fallout far beyond paychecks. On Friday, air traffic controllers calling in sick slowed air traffic across the Northeast; hundreds of workers at the Internal Revenue Service also did not show up; and the F.B.I. director said he was as angry as he had ever been over his agents not being paid.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153None of us are willing to go through this again,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, referring to a half-dozen Republicans who voted on Thursday for a Democratic measure to reopen the government for two weeks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just a few of us. There are a great many in our conference that feel pretty strongly.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Democrats, who declined to revel in their clear victory, said they would work in good faith to strike a deal on border security. They have raised their offer on border security funding considerably and toughened their rhetoric on stopping illegal immigration.\n But Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated plainly that any compromise would not include money for a new border wall, which Democrats view as ineffective and overly costly even though many have supported border fencing in the past.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Have I not been clear on a wall?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. The two have repeatedly said they would support allocating additional money for technology and increased patrols along the border, like the ones Mr. Trump referenced on Friday.\n The cease-fire should pave the way for Mr. Trump to deliver his State of the Union address to Congress after all, but Ms. Pelosi said it would not be held this Tuesday, as originally scheduled. She had rescinded her invitation this week to come to the House chamber until the government was reopened, and on Friday, she said she would work with Mr. Trump to find a new date.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The State of the Union is not planned now,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ms. Pelosi said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When government is open we will discuss a mutually agreeable date.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n As he announced the deal, Mr. Trump paid tribute to the federal workers who have endured five weeks without pay, expressing sympathy for them in a way he had not until now. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You are fantastic people,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he said.\n He promised to ensure that workers would be compensated for the paychecks they have missed since the shutdown began in late December \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very quickly or as soon as possible.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d To that effect, the Office of Management and Budget circulated a letter to affected agencies and departments on Friday afternoon instructing management to prepare for an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153orderly reopening\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and to prioritize pay and benefits for workers.\n But other costs will be more permanent. Many federal contractors do not expect to be repaid for their work during the shutdown. Its compounding effects will ultimately cost the federal government more money than if it was open. And though the long-term economic damage caused by the shutdown remains to be seen, it appears that at the very least the short-term pain was more costly than a down payment on the border wall.\n According to an analysis from Standard & Poor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, the ratings agency, the United States economy lost at least $6 billion in the five weeks the government was partly shuttered \u00e2\u20ac\u201d more than the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump had requested to build a steel or concrete barrier at the border.\n Mr. Trump offered no explanation for his surrender, nor did he acknowledge that it was one. On Twitter on Friday night, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was in no way a concession. It was taking care of millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the Shutdown with the understanding that in 21 days, if no deal is done, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s off to the races!\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n During the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech earlier in the day, cabinet officials and White House aides lined the sides of the Rose Garden and applauded him. Mr. Trump began his remarks as if he had actually emerged victorious, saying that he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very proud to announce\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d what he called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Few lawmakers even in the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own party saw it that way.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I hail from a state that is very supportive of the president and border security with barriers, so that is a consideration for me, but there are a lot of other strategies we could employ that would work better\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d than a shutdown, said Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia.\n With polls showing the president enduring most of the blame by the public, Republicans led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, pressured Mr. Trump to agree to the temporary truce. Over the next three weeks, a House-Senate conference committee representing both parties will negotiate a border security plan, but if it fails to reach a consensus, government agencies could close again.\n The president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concession came a day after two competing measures to reopen the government failed on the Senate floor. A Democratic bill, which would have reopened the government with no strings attached, received more votes than the bill backed by Mr. Trump, which included temporary protections for some undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion for his proposed border wall.\n Mr. McConnell and Mr. Schumer huddled on Thursday night after the failed votes to discuss a path forward. Mr. Schumer rejected the idea of offering a down payment for the wall to reopen the government and pitched Mr. McConnell on what ultimately became the agreement with Mr. Trump, according to a senior Democratic aide.\n Mr. McConnell, who viewed the shutdown as unnecessary from the start, found Mr. Trump eager to end the impasse, and in a series of calls, they ironed out the details. To the Republican leader, it was a way to ease much of the pressure on federal workers and get the Senate back to work.\n As late as early Friday morning, Mr. Trump appeared intent on declaring a national emergency at the border alongside the agreement to reopen the government, but Mr. McConnell and White House officials encouraged him to drop the idea, according to people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to discuss them.\n Republican leaders tried to rally their members during a closed policy luncheon before Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s votes. But even as Republicans prepared to support Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan, the signs of mounting frustration after weeks of inaction were evident.\n Republican senators rose one by one to voice concerns about the effect on federal workers and the lack of forward momentum in an impasse that felt unbearable. They swore they would never stand by another government shutdown.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already lost,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d lamented Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, according to people familiar with the remarks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a matter of the extent we want to keep losing.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n At another point, during an exchange first reported by The Washington Post, Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, vented at Mr. McConnell for putting Republicans in the position of having to vote on two competing approaches to reopen the government \u00e2\u20ac\u201d one Republican and one Democratic \u00e2\u20ac\u201d without consulting them first.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You put us in this position,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Johnson said, according to one of his aides.\n Mr. McConnell, who had largely been absent from negotiations to reopen the government until late last week, responded, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Are you suggesting I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m enjoying this?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took a stand for fellow House freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib on Saturday after the latter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expletive-laced comments in favor of impeaching President Trump.\n Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic socialist lawmaker from New York, went on Twitter to weigh in, accusing the GOP of a having a double standard.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Republican hypocrisy at its finest: saying that Trump admitting to sexual assault on tape is just \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclocker room talk,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but scandalizing themselves into faux-outrage when my sis says a curse word in a bar,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153GOP lost entitlement to policing women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behavior a long time ago. Next.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n The lawmaker was apparently referring to a 2005 video that came to light ahead of the 2016 presidential election, in which Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u201c talking to Billy Bush \u00e2\u20ac\u201c made lewd comments about women.\n Trump issued an apology at the time and described the contents of the \"Access Hollywood\" recording as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153locker room banter.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d  He later released a followup video apology, insisting the remarks didn't \"reflect who I am.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize,\" Trump said.\n On Saturday, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted a vow to support Tlaib, D-Mich.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I got your back @RashidaTlaib - the Bronx and Detroit ride together,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she tweeted.\n Tlaib, who was sworn in as a new member of the 116th Congress on Thursday, was videotaped that night vowing to impeach the president -- shortly after she penned an op-ed for The Detroit Free Press outlining the case for impeachment.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People love you and you win,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the video showed Tlaib telling supporters.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And when your son looks at you and says: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMomma, look you won. Bullies don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t win.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122  And I said, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBaby, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re gonna go in there and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re gonna impeach the motherf***er.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n House Republicans fumed over the comments on Friday, with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., prodding Speaker Nancy Pelosi to act.\n Yet Pelosi, D-Calif., downplayed Tlaib\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks, expressing distaste for the language but suggesting that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own language had started the heated rhetoric in Washington.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I probably have a generational reaction to it,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Pelosi said at an MSNBC town hall.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But in any event, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not in the censorship business.  I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like that language, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use that language.  I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.establish any language standards for my colleagues, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anything worse than what the president has said.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In the Rose Garden on Friday, Trump said he found Tlaib\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disgraceful\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and thought she \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dishonored herself\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d as well as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153her family.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Tlaib, doubling down on her comments, tweeted on Friday that she \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will always speak truth to power. #unapologeticallyMe.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not just about Donald Trump. This is about all of us. In the face of this constitutional crisis, we must rise,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d she tweeted.\n",

But the declaration and other money-moving plans allow Trump to continue to fight for border wall construction while also averting another partial government shutdown -- which would have been triggered at midnight absent the new funding package. He signed the spending deal Friday afternoon.\n Trump, in the Rose Garden, declared once again that \"walls work\" as he confirmed the emergency declaration would accompany the spending legislation.\n \"We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about an invasion of our country,\" Trump said.\n And in an almost-casual tone, the president predicted a legal fight that will wind up before the Supreme Court.\n \"We will have a national emergency, and we will then be sued,\" Trump said, adding that the federal appeals courts could well rule against his administration. \"Then we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get a fair shake, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll win at the Supreme Court -- just like the [travel] ban.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n A senior administration official told Fox News that the White House plans to move $8 billion in currently appropriated or available funds toward construction of the wall. Of that, $3 billion could be diverted with help from the emergency declaration.\n That money includes about $600 million from the Treasury Department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forfeiture fund. That money has been described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153easy money\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d that the White House can use however it wants. The White House is also expected to use drug interdiction money from the Department of Defense.\n But by declaring an emergency, Trump would also seek to unlock money from the Defense Department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s military construction budget, to the tune of $3.5 billion.\n Diverting Pentagon funding, however, is expected to set off a legal battle and has already prompted fierce opposition from Democrats in Congress.\n \"This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed President, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. \"The President's actions clearly violate the Congress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exclusive power of the purse, which our Founders enshrined in the Constitution.\"\n They vowed Congress would \"defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the Courts, and in the public, using every remedy available.\"\n \"The President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declaration of a national emergency would be an abuse of his constitutional oath and an affront to the separation of powers. Congress has the exclusive power of the purse, and the Constitution specifically prohibits the President from spending money that has not been appropriated. ... This is a gross abuse of power that cannot be tolerated,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a statement.\n This is far from the only declared national emergency. According to the Congressional Research Service, there are at least 30 \"national emergencies\" in effect, including those concerning blocking Iranian government property, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other terror-related acts. But none of the emergencies have involved the president of the United States spending money that had not been specifically appropriated by Congress.\n The president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to declare a national emergency comes after a review of the spending package. The compromise package, which was negotiated for weeks in a bipartisan conference committee, passed both the House and the Senate on Thursday. But the deal would provide only a fraction of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s originally proposed figure of $5.7 billion for border security and construction of a wall or physical barrier along the southern border.\n The bill also imposed a number of restrictions on the White House, with legislative language preventing the administration from moving funding around to get a barrier or a wall -- a factor that may have contributed to the emergency declaration decision.\n The package, as it stands, is enough to build just 55 miles of barrier. And notably, the word \"wall\" does not appear once in the 1,768 pages of legislation and explanatory materials.\n The funding battle follows the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. From Dec. 22 through Jan. 25\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfor 35 days\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe White House and congressional Democrats battled over border security funding. Trump requested $5.7 billion for construction of the wall, while Democrats vowed to block any spending proposal that included such funding. The shutdown left more than 800,000 federal employees and contractors furloughed or working without pay. At the end of last month, though, Trump signed a short-term spending package that funded the government through the Friday deadline.\n The prior fight left little appetite on either side of the aisle for another shutdown, leading to the passage Thursday of the compromise measure.\n Trump, though, has talked for weeks about taking executive action to divert money from other programs for wall construction, without congressional sign-off\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddespite his criticisms of former President Barack Obama for using executive action.\n",

Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) to resign as its chairman over his public comments about the Russia investigation, which did not determine that President Donald Trump or anyone on his campaign conspired with Russia to win the 2016 election.\n Schiff has maintained his strong belief that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, after the nearly two-year probe came to an end last week without directly implicating the president.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Undoubtedly there is collusion,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Schiff told The Washington Post on Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will continue to investigate the counterintelligence issues. That is, is the president or people around him compromised in any way by a hostile foreign power? ... It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear that was any part of [special counsel Robert] Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n In a letter dated Thursday, the GOP committee members accused Schiff of standing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at the center of a well-orchestrated media campaign\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d about a possible Trump-Russia connection. The group even went so far as to link Schiff to leaked information about the investigation.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Your willingness to continue to promote a demonstrably false narrative is alarming,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d they said, joining other top Republican lawmakers demanding Schiff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ouster.\n Trump himself called on Schiff to resign Thursday in an early-morning tweet that accused the chairman of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unlawfully lying and leaking\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d information. The president said Schiff should be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forced\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d to step down from Congress entirely.\n Somewhat misleadingly, the GOP committee members stated in their letter that Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings \u00e2\u20ac\u0153conclusively refute\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Schiff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153past and present assertions\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d about the investigation.

The offer would also give a three-year extension to 300,000 people from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Honduras who are living in the U.S. under the temporary protected status program.\n Democrats rejected the offer before Trump even announced it on Saturday, however, maintaining that it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go nearly far enough and that the president ought to reopen the government before any negotiations over the border proceed.\n But the GOP bill incorporating his offer would also gut existing asylum laws for children and trafficking victims from Central America, ban asylum for minors who present themselves at ports of entry, gut the concept of temporary protected status for future cases and expand immigration detention \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 all measures making it more likely to be dead on arrival in the Senate.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given the poison pills stuffed into a proposal that was supposed to entice Democrats we can now say the Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoffer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t about getting to a deal but about shifting blame. So obvious. So predictable. So pathetic,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Frank Sharry, the executive director of the immigration advocacy group America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Voice, tweeted on Tuesday.\n The bill would ban asylum for Central American minors, including those who arrive at the border with their parents, unless the minors apply for asylum in their home country. It would also cap the number of Central American minors who are allowed to apply for asylum each year at 50,000 and limit the number of asylum applications that could be granted per year to 15,000.\n The administration has for months tried to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in the U.S. as part of a broader effort to stem the flow of Central American migrants crossing the border from Mexico. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administrative attempts to curtail the asylum process have faced legal challenges in two federal courts, however, prompting this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legislative fix.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This bill includes the most extreme changes on asylum that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Kerri Talbot, the director of federal advocacy at the group Immigration Hub, said on a press call on Tuesday.\n Under the GOP bill, minors who apply for asylum would face much stiffer consequences for filing an application found to be frivolous \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 including permanent ineligibility for future protections.\n The bill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s changes to asylum law alarmed immigration activists online, as well some on the right, including attorney and conservative writer Gabriel Malor.\n Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to win over Democratic support on the bill \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 which will require at least 60 votes to pass in the Senate \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 hit even more trouble on Tuesday after the Supreme Court once again did not act on the administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effort to end DACA. The move essentially left protections for Dreamers in place for at least the next several months \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 giving Democrats less incentive to agree to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offer of protections to DACA recipients.\n",

But it took little more than 24 hours this week for a freshman House Democrat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exuberant, expletive-laden impeachment promise to upend the bonhomie of a new Congress and prompt President Trump, by his own telling, to ask the newly elected speaker if Democrats planned to impeach him.\n The episode began Thursday night, just hours after the 116th Congress was sworn in, when a camera captured Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan promising profanely to impeach Mr. Trump as she drew cheers from liberal activists at a celebration at a bar near the Capitol. By the time Mr. Trump discussed the matter directly in a news conference in the Rose Garden on Friday afternoon, weeks of speculation about his potential peril had burst into the open.\n Republicans, eager to portray Democrats as out to destroy Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency, piled on criticism of Ms. Tlaib \u00e2\u20ac\u201d some of it racially tinged. (Ms. Tlaib, who is Palestinian-American, is one of the first Muslims in Congress. The Christian Broadcasting Network referred to her as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153foul-mouthed Islamic congresswoman.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d) Democratic leaders, who view discussion of impeachment as politically dangerous and premature, offered worried words meant to tamp down speculation about their intentions.\n Perhaps out of a belief that an impeachment fight would help him politically \u00e2\u20ac\u201d as it did President Bill Clinton in the 1990s \u00e2\u20ac\u201d or outright fear that newly empowered Democrats actually might threaten his presidency, Mr. Trump dived into the conversation head first.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We even talked about that today,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d he told reporters in the Rose Garden, referring to an exchange with Speaker Nancy Pelosi during a meeting earlier Friday to try to negotiate an end to the shutdown of the government, which Mr. Trump threatened to keep closed for years if he did not get money from Congress for a wall on the southern border. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I said, Why don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you use this for impeachment? And Nancy said, We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not looking to impeach you.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Senior aides to Ms. Pelosi and other Democrats in the room disputed that characterization. The president had indeed invoked Ms. Tlaib and other House Democrats who want to impeach him, they said, but Ms. Pelosi tried to shift the meeting back to its intended topic and did not offer the president reassurances.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In his opening comments at the meeting, President Trump brought up impeachment,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ms. Pelosi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesman, Drew Hammill, wrote on Twitter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Speaker Pelosi made clear that today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting was about re-opening government, not impeachment.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Regardless, Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s frank embrace of the issue was another astonishing development: a president of the United States talking openly about his potential impeachment at a White House news conference.\n Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump had asked on Twitter, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time? \u00e2\u20ac\\x9d He continued the theme at his news conference by asserting that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impeach somebody who is doing a great job.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Ms. Pelosi and senior Democrats said they were determined not to take the bait for now and risk generating a backlash from Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supporters, who would most likely see impeachment as the overreaction of out-of-control Democrats. But the words of Ms. Tlaib, who stood by her comments on Friday, made evident the pressure already mounting from the left, where public opinion polls suggest a majority of liberals want the president removed from office.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People love you and you win,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ms. Tlaib told the crowd Thursday night. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And when your son looks at you and says: \u00e2\u20ac\u2122Momma, look, you won. Bullies don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t win.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 And I said, \u00e2\u20ac\u2122Baby, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to go in there, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to impeach the motherfucker.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n She made no apologies for the remark on Friday, proclaiming that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will always speak truth to power\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and fashioning her own hashtag, #unapologeticallyme. She told a Detroit television station that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably exactly how my grandmother, if she was alive, would say it.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Her outburst ran counter to all Democratic talking points. Ms. Pelosi and her deputies have repeatedly made the case that it is too early to consider impeachment. Even as Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legal perils have deepened \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and federal prosecutors in New York appear to have gathered evidence implicating him in a campaign finance crime \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Democrats have said they want to wait to see the findings of an investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, of the president, his campaign and Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to interfere in the 2016 election.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really like that kind of language,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee \u00e2\u20ac\u201d where any impeachment inquiry must begin \u00e2\u20ac\u201d said on CNN. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But more to the point, I disagree with what she said. It is too early to talk about that intelligently. We have to follow the facts.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Ms. Pelosi defended Ms. Tlaib on Friday at a town hall hosted by MSNBC at the speaker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alma mater in Washington, Trinity University. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not in the censorship business,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ms. Pelosi said.\n The Constitution grants the House the power to impeach executive branch officials for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d but what constitutes such crimes has traditionally been defined by the majority party of the House. A vote to impeach takes a simple majority in the House, but a two-thirds vote is needed in the Senate to convict and remove an official from office.\n Mr. Nadler, Ms. Pelosi and other party elders believe Mr. Trump is threatening the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s democratic institutions. Privately, many harbor suspicions that he obstructed justice, collaborated with the Russians in 2016 or both. But they also argue that an impeachment that does not have a reasonable shot of winning a conviction in the Senate will backfire and strengthen Mr. Trump in the 2020 campaign. In the meantime, they are planning to open multiple investigations into accusations of wrongdoing around the president, his campaign and his administration.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t avoid impeachment for a political reason,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Ms. Pelosi said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll just have to see how it comes.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Republicans ignored the distinction.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is this the behavior that we are going to find with this new majority party in Congress?\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, asked at a news conference. He repeatedly singled out Ms. Pelosi, asking why she had not censured Ms. Tlaib.\n Mr. Trump was similarly critical of Ms. Tlaib.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I thought her comments were disgraceful,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Trump said at the news conference. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think she dishonored herself, and I think she dishonored her family.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d He added that her comments were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disrespectful to the United States of America.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Ms. Tlaib is far from alone among House Democrats. Representatives Brad Sherman of California and Al Green of Texas formally introduced an article of impeachment on Thursday, charging that Mr. Trump had obstructed justice in firing James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director. Others are expected to follow.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I continue to believe that obstruction of justice is the clearest, simplest and most provable high crime and misdemeanor committed by Donald J. Trump,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Mr. Sherman said in a statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I hope that the articles of impeachment are the subject of hearings before the Judiciary Committee early in 2019.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n Many of Ms. Tlaib\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new colleagues expressed sympathy for her sentiments, even as they said the House should proceed differently.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald Trump is going to be impeached whether it is by the ballot box or Congress,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California and a member of the Intelligence Committee. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It will just be a matter of which one comes first.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n But, Mr. Swalwell added, Democrats need to avoid making \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a martyr\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d out of Mr. Trump by affording him \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a fairer investigation than he deserves.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n",

Mark Warner (D-Va.) released a statement immediately after the Mueller report was revealed to be complete, demanding that Barr quickly put together a redacted, releasable version for Congress to access.\n Warner said in a statement: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Congress and the American people deserve to judge the facts for themselves. The Special Counsel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report must be provided to Congress immediately, and the Attorney General should swiftly prepare a declassified version of the report for the public. Nothing short of that will suffice.\n It is also critical that all documents related to the Special Counsel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation be preserved and made available to the appropriate Congressional committees. Any attempt by the Trump Administration to cover up the results of this investigation into Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack on our democracy would be unacceptable.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\n He joined a number of other Democrats, including several 2020 presidential candidates, who either had statements prepared or tweeted about a prompt release.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The American people deserve to know the full truth about Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interference in our democracy,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d tweeted former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00c3\u00a1n Castro.\n Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said that the report should be released \u00e2\u20ac\u0153without delay,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) released a joint statement in agreement.\n They, like Warner, didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want Trump to throw a wrench in Congress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 spokes by getting early access to the documents.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Attorney General Barr must not give President Trump, his lawyers or his staff any \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsneak preview\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of Special Counsel Mueller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings or evidence, and the White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the joint statement said.\n Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, echoed Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own earlier call to release the report.\n Meanwhile, CNN reports that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153principal conclusion\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d of the report, which the attorney general will soon give to Congress, is expected to be made public.\n Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s camp wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t champing at the bit.\n \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re pleased that the Office of Special Counsel has delivered its report to the Attorney General pursuant to the regulations. Attorney General Barr will determine the appropriate next steps,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow in a joint statement.\n",
