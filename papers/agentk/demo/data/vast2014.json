Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos. \n\nTwo weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around Tiskele Bend.  \"The gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away. \n\nThe change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out of Tethys. \n\nEstablished in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis. \n\nWith a population of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a cafe. Here you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations. \n\n\"We've made a good living for a long time,\" Reese tells me. \n\nI asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech's operations.   \n\nI caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at the Osvaldo hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers.\n\n",

They handed out information on flyers printed and donated by local businesses about the lifestyle incongruities between today's elected officials and those of a few years ago. Demonstrators held posters of POK martyrs and chanted for social and economic parity, while black-clad members of the Abila Police formed faceless lines of shields, batons and side arms surrounding the crowds.  The rally had been publicized as a peaceful gathering of citizens to bring their concerns to the public consciousness.  The most dangerous item in their hands was a picture of a sweet-faced ten year dead old girl - Juliana Vann who died in 1998 of cancer caused by the benzene in her drinking water. \n\nDespite these heavy-handed efforts, as groups of people slipped through the barricades and moved through the streets to bring their message to the citizens of Kronos.   \n\nHow can these officials - hypothetically getting by on public salaries - afford the second homes, large boats and luxury automobiles they flaunt?\n\n",

Elian knew his would be a difficult journey.  He had watched his father, Jeroen and the founder of the POK, Henk Bodrogi, walk the very path he would tread.  Elian knew the course would not be easy, and would leave little time for a personal life. \n\n\"Elian's journey ended three years ago today.\" \n\nOver the course of the afternoon several other speakers paid tribute to not only Elian, but all who have been victims of the environmental catastrophe brought about by greed and corruption of public officials.  The police agitated many of the crowd, causing them to have to leave the assembly rather than be assailed with batons and pepper spray.\n\n",

Requests for information were met with assurances that the police,  whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death, would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation.  After Karel's body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel's death stating that \"we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries.\"\n\nAs reported at the time of Karel's death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel's body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police. \n\nPolice have denied anything unusual happened in Karel's death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence. \n\nYesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water.   \n\n\"Both of them died because of government lies and corruption,\" one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.  \"Juliana died because Kronos allowed GAStech to poison our water, and Elian died because he tried to bring Juliana justice.\"\n\n",

But not only which is they, which and why they protest? \n\nThe Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis in accordance with the opinion of Wellness for All(WFA), an international group of safety of water. The POK was launched to give the attention to thequestions of clean water surrounding Elodis to the government of Kronos and of the world. The POK affirms that the site of international natural gas drilling of curve of GAStech Tiskele is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional fields surrounding Elodis. \n\nIn 1998, WFA carried out test on the water of Elodis finding the levels high of benzene, arsenic of toluene and xylene, barium, chromium, lead and selenium. The test of a following report released by an attention and pressure on the international government and GAStech brought by WFA to the act. However, with reducing WFA in fragments due to the questions of placement, the requests of the POK were mainly ignored and reduced the value. \n\nMoreover in 1998, Juliana Vann, ten years old and previously healthy - died of a prolonged disease, which WFA claimed  was caused by contamination of water. The government of Kronos officially refuted the complaint quoting the fragmentation of the organization of WFA like obviousness of a dubious source not to make confidence. Without worrying, Juliana was well to the martyrdom of the POK and employed the image of Juliana on the literature of countryside since. \n\nThe second principal martyr of POK is Elian Karel, which died in 2009 while imprisoned unspecified causes. The POK affirms it was stopped above trumped to the top of the expenses while the government of Kronos it question was a radical activist and violent one occupied in tax avoidance. Karel had been implied POK since its beginning since his/her father, Jeroen Karel, were an original member.  The death of Elan Karel in 2009 was marked for spontaneous examples of protest around Abila. The day of his death, June 19, saw protests, demonstrations, riots, and violence additional. \n\nThe POK evolved of the peaceful protests and the demonstrations requiring the action of government to more violent activities including riots while they claim that the government made little with nothing by addressing the contamination, the intoxications, and the deaths suffered by their people. In date of 2011, the government of Kronos marked the POK as \"threatens public\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts that GAStech International's Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis. However, with the fragmenting of WFA due to funding issues, the POK's demands were largely ignored and downplayed. The Government of Kronos officially refuted the claim citing the fragmentation of the WFA organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted. Regardless, Juliana became the POK's first martyr and has used Juliana's image on campaign literature ever since.  \n\n The POK's second major martyr is Elian Karel, who died in 2009 while incarcerated of undetermined causes. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion. Karel had been involved with the POK since its inception given that his father, Jeroen Karel, was an original member.  \n\nThe POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people. As of 2011, the Government of Kronos has labeled the POK as a \"public threat\".\n\n",

Edvard Vann, a GAStech Kronos security guard who was interrogated and released after 6 hours, gave the indication that the Protectors of Kronos were involved or at least suspected as being the perpetrators behind today's events. \n\nA GAStech International senior security executive has been on site to support the investigation aiding the Abila Police Department and Kronos Government officials. Shortly after the morning meeting ended at 10:00, Abila Fire Department trucks responded to reports of a fire at the GAStech office.\n\n",

No local residents were injured as well and though some residents of Elodis were evacuated from their homes the investigation indicates that the evacuation was unnecessary.  \n\nWhile the official cause of the explosion is still under investigation, the problem may have come from a defect in the wellhead itself.

However, the protests have turned violent with smashed windows and vandalized shops. \n\nCountless shop windows smashed in and around Siopa, the downtown shopping area. A general sense of chaos broke out with chanting protesters, fires, and fleeing citizens.  \n\nA unifying theme of the protesters was the chanted slogans including \"Justice for Elian\" in reference to previously mentioned activist Elian Karel and \"Remember Juliana\", a young girl from Elodis who died in 1998 allegedly from the effects of water contamination.

Bodrogi has cultivated the soybeans its whole life, like its father and his parents. I asked to him about its life in the farm.\n\n\"We have worked the Earth during long time - perhaps 200 years, perhaps a small piece more,\" Henk Bodrogi said to me as it chose on a package of per to us, looking for the right size.  \"On the years we have added some hectares here and there.  To us it maintains occupied.\"\n\nOccupied it is an underestimation, as I found when I punctured to farmer wiry to say to me more.\n\n \"My wife obtains the raising of children and title to teach, then she will do a little something so that we eat for the lunch and we work next to me until supper.  When the children get school caretakers make their tasks, and we are all in the house most of the times by darkness.\"\n\n\"We do this most of the days,\" he we added, \"with the exception of days of the adoration.\"\n\n\"All we know one another one here,\" Bodrogi we explained whereas we go away. \"Most of the families they have lived here for the generations.  The first new people who came to the city were with that company of the gas that constructed the back part of some years.\"\n\nI request Bodrogi if the business has been good. \n\n\"We made quite good recently until time.  The benefits were good and added cultivated area, or increased the equipment.  Then we began to have all this hardship with the harvests.\"\n\nHow, I it requested.\n\n\"The harvests are not producing as they have in the past.  It awhile took the figure towards, outside then one of the calculated officials of the city towards outside calling in a specialist of the water.  They proved when it they said that the water was contaminated.\"\n\nBodrodgi sighed, and with a glance surrounded in its eye thanked for he me by my interest and this it had to me to direct it the back home.I th anked for it I watched and to raise it in its car and head outside city.\n\nThe specialist of the water turned out to be the international agency \"health for all\", an international agency with a mission to bring the healthy water to the communities caused sorrow by natural disasters, sketch and - coincidently - oil and development of the gas.\n\nI took for above with a representative of the health for all the following day.  Joclyn Reynolds is coordinating of the project for the \"health for all\".  She spoke to me on a call based on the satellites of her office of the field in Asia South-Eastern where she was efforts of the relevation of the creation which followed an earthquake. Ms Reynolds decided to speak me by some minutes between the meetings on its work in Elodis.\n\n\"A civil employee of the city on a problem we made contact with enemy whereupon they had with its local water.  In years of last agriculture one had collapsed, and the incidence of certain diseases and defects of birth had risen.  The potable water of Elodis comes from the river of Tiskele, like all the water to cultivate, so we looked for a source against the current.  We above find sources of the useless disposition of the production in <km> of the operation of GAStech by waters.  The tests demonstrated to stops levels of the benzene, the tolueno, arsenic of xylene, the lead and the selenium, among other toxins. \"\n\n\"These substances Can happen naturally\" I asked to him.\n\n\"Not in these amounts, and not this one suddenly.  The contamination of the underground water is generally the result of the human activity.  The pipes of GAStech are sending the polluting agents in a pool.  The toxins are forming plume subsurface that leaks in the river of Tiskele of which the residents of the drainage of Elodis its potable water and irrigation for the harvests.\"\n\n\"You spoke with GAStech on this?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" she answered.  \"We thought at the outset that we gained the traction.  We solved several times with the representatives of GAStech, including one of \"the senior\" executives, Fluss hank.  It assured personally to us that GAStech would act responsible to provide material and financial aid towards efforts of the cleaning.  After a time, although, got to be clear that whereas Mr. Fluss was serious it was Sanjorge that makes the decisions.  It is evident that it [Sanjorge] does not have any interest in the well-being of the residents of Elodis, or the atmosphere.\"\n\nSten Sanjorge, the Jr, who had inherited his part in the company of his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for the practices of business of cutthroat.\n\n\"When we did not make progress with GAStech,\" Reynolds continued, \"the leaders of the community decided to approach the government of Kronos for the aid.   By our policy - and with the permission of the leaders of Elodis - we published the test results in an official public document.  The leaders of then Elodis approached the officials of the government like citizens of a community of Kronesian armed with the scientific analysis.  To our he assured them agency that we would be again available to help anyway when those agreements were concluded. \"\n\nTo this point the Reynolds far from the telephone called ms, so I returned to my friend of the editor, Pondo Reese to tell to end history.\n\nPart three will be published the 15 of May of 1998\n\n",

In Tethys some years ago, I traveled laborious to the gas fields moved away of Tethys to watch a new debatable area of the energy production.\n\nOne of the sites that I visited was a local office of the company of the gas of Sanjorge, finessed with the shippers of the work and the reinforced covers and the chemical agents and the sources you need to work an operation of the gas. Like it memory, a previous truck driver was responsible.\n\nIt was an alive example of how a once small reconnaissance company of Thethys had begun to grow in a powerful international force in the industry of the energy.\n\nBut it had forgotten to me on the encounter until I again went to Tethys the other day for the first time from its years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: a man (one of the richest individuals of Tethys) who has lived with the whole history of the gas that prospected and has prospered powerfully of him.\n\nBut like I was around the capital city of the people who entrevistaba with of the center, soon I made that this was not right a history of the new energy. Something very significant has happened to give return to the center in a global center of the masters of the industry of the gas.

Then it looked like a pretty impossible dream, giving returned to an island of the coal in a place with the abundant sources of the oil and gas.\n\nIt was looked like us in the coast of the west of Scotland that the city far thrown of the center, Tethys was able to great small piece for its shippers, beginning to believe in a new industry of the fantasy.\n\nMuch to the grief of its mother, meanwhile, Sten Sanjorge had begun the prospection in early years 60.\n\nBy early years 70, a new company of the gas, GAStech, began his monster-like advances.\n\nUnder its direction canny, GAStech was developed in an important jet of the natural gas to the local region, and later it foments much to the distant spot. Now it has employees of the thousands and it works in numerous countries. \n\nThe change in center has been substantial.  You notice in the constant uproar of helicopters to-Ing. and fro-Ing. towards it go to the moved away areas, and the planes aligned in the airport of the city to backwards go and execs forwards and of the city.\n\nAnd as you lead around the center, almost each traffic circle is sponsored by a division of GAStech. \n\nSanjorge has recently begun to pay more attention to the pastimes and philanthropy, allowing that its Fluss hank of the Jr and the Co-founder of Sten of the son directs the company. But Sanjorge finishes requesting itself to produce a report for the government of Tethan that recommends the best ways to make sure that Tethys continues producing the energy per decades to come.\n\nThe matter of easy-to-obtaining has taken place, so to keep to come from the gas it will need much investment and new readier techniques, such as the hyperacid techniques of the retirement of the substratum developed by the company in 1974. \n\nIt so thanks for ready people as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, center has reached what wishes each place in where the raw materials are discovered to do. The city has taken the temporary favor from the energy in its threshold, and it has given to return in the specialized knowledge and the intellectual characteristic him that can make center a center of masters of the long gas after the gas itself works towards outside.\n\n\n\n",

The exploration has proven an controversial edition in Kronos>>\n\nTo continue reading main history\t\n\nThe son of the founder of the company of the gas that GAStech is planning a company to perforate inside the Mediterranean Sea, the times has learned.\n\nSten Sanjorge, Jr thinks that there are the great volumes of gas coast outside that could be extracted.\n\nSanjorge and GAStech were granted to three licenses by the government of Kronos the month last through the ministry of the energy and the development and hopes to begin the exploration soon.\n\n\"The gas certainly coast outside is not a new concept, but there is no reason with the history of Kronosian of the development coast outside that we cannot develop to these resources coast outside,\" he said the times.\n\nThe gas of the slate is extracted using the controversial technique of the hyperacid retirement of the substratum that implies injecting of acid layers of the slate of chemical agents, to break them for above and sending the catched natural gas inside.\n\nThe hyperacid retirement of the substratum has produced the extensive amounts of gas and oil in the one of the west, having transformed the market of the energy. But the projects in Europe have been slow to remove, surrounded with the opposition of the government and local communities.\n\nMany ecologists think that the hyperacid retirement of the substratum can damage marine atmospheres, and oppose the extraction of the new resources of the fossil fuel. But perforating coast outside avoids the necessity of the difficult negotiations with the local advice, communities and landholders.\n\nIn agreement with existing geologic data, SanJorge thinks that a considerable amount of gas is in the place - up to 100 cubical feet trill\u00f3n, that would be more than the estimations of GAStech for their terrestrial resources. There is also the possibility of finding the oil.\n\nGAStech has considered that the resources coast outside of the gas of the slate of the total of Kronos could be between five and 10 times the terrestrial size of the available one of the resources.\n\n\"We are that the resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous,\" said very comfortable SanJorge.  \"Is anyone of that one explotable? That one is billion questions of the dollar, and GAStech wiling to invest in the answer.\"\n\nAlthough it has gotten to be only recently controversial, the hyperacid retirement of the substratum has been used in one more a smaller scale by many years, to improve the gas and conventional well flow of the oil. But to use the process in a great amount of needed wells to extract the gas coast outside of the slate never has been made commercially.\n\nProfessor Oskar Wertz of the university of Tethys is skeptical around if the gas coast outside of the slate could be a great contribuidor to the European energy in the next decade, but says that he could have potential in the one of more long term.\n\n\"GAStech is being optimistic is its estimations of how long will take to explore the slate outside coast. He is perfectly reasonable that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyperacid technology of the retirement of the substratum will have so advanced and the way of which we took care outside of the ambient coast we will have so advanced that this could be a really great industry. The task in the 10 next years is to try these things towards outside, considers if they work.\" \n\n",

Nevertheless, it has humble principles like prospector of the oil and the gas in Tethys. \n\nHe spoke to the times on the characteristics of a leader guessed right in Kronos and what foreign CEOs can hope in the market. \n\nQ:  What can foreign CEOs wait for when it comes to Kronos?\n\nA: The economic atmosphere has changed from years 80. He is much more hard to be successful today. Foreign necessity of CEOs to play under its expectations. There are no easy triumphs in Kronos. The foreign competition between Kronosian and companies are resistant. It is difficult to gain the hearts and the minds of the population.\n\nBut there is less difference than people think between the culture of Kronosian and, culture of Tethian of the opinion. The personnel of Kronos works hardly like hardly, she is respectful of her work and has he himself desire for the success. Also they know to appreciate to the efficient communication and a talented leader.\n\nWhat foreign leader needs to do it is to learn how to communicate the \"way of Kronosian\" and to take time to understand its personnel.\n\nQ:  Can you elaborate?\n\nA: There are many cultural differences in communicating. [Considerar] the notes. Foreign CEOs always confused and is frustrated when somebody in Kronos sends a note [] and counts on a simple answer of yes/no. In place they obtain a very long answer that it does not answer its initial question.\n\nThe people of Kronos do not have taste to take responsibility. They scare it to lose his works and she does not have taste of being forced in saying something that it does not wish a. Foreign necessity of CEOs to take this in consideration and to need to take the time to understand how to communicate.\n\nThe patience is key. The transparency can be an excellent way to obtain around this. It is an European value that Kronosians is very responsivo a. The imposition of him in a company can make the trip of a foreign CEO in Kronos a much more pleasant experience.\n\nQ:  Which is the challenges of the pipe a foreign CEO can do in front on arrival in Kronos?\n\nA: It is sometimes the simplest things that they can be desafiadoras, like obtaining of A to B in a taxi. The power to obtain around is taken easily for granted and not being able to do so it creates a great sense of the insecurity. In Kronos you never are safe if his conductor falls to him dull in the feasible line. This can look like as a small edition but on a daily base is very annoying.\n\nAnother one is becoming familiar with its equipment and with whom you are working. The often foreign right of the passage of CEOs of the plane and in an office completely of the fellow workers of Kronos. They do not have any idea that is, how they work or how they are described are. This can be confused. \n\nQ:  Can you give some extremities in how a foreign CEO can prepare yourself?\n\nA: The first thing that would say is to prepare its family. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new surroundings of work. This can affect personal life. The family and the work who mix themselves are practical very common here. The people of Kronos work in extra hours and socialize with her colleagues. It is very different from Tethys where there is a clear limit between the work and the family.\n\nForeign CEOs must also make how he is resistant is the competition and how much hard work must be put inside to be successful -- often much more that in its countries of origin. The language is a great edition.\n\n[But] does not concern you at the most is prepared, the true experience of the work and to live in Kronos it will always surprise to him.\n\nQ:  How difficult - or easy - is to being a foreign CEO in Kronos?\n\nA: Generally, I think that being a CEO he is hard. There are many of pressure, the atmosphere is resistant and is difficult to find a balance with its personal life.\n\nWhen an equipment of hears them to Kronos that a CEO is coming from overseas assumes is a problem. But, cultural they do not have an edition with the foreigners. \n\nQ:  Hay the situations in which the foreign executive being is really an advantage?\n\nA: This question really depends on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and the culture. If they do not deliver any attack then to locate he is a net one harms. But in certain negotiations or certain editions such as luxury merchandize, foreign CEOs can be an advantage. They can bring another point of view, facilitate the process.\n\nThe foreign CEO has better knowledge of an industry and can sometimes bring the access to the overseas markets. This can be true assets.\n\n",

He had been arrested three months prior for spurious charges of tax evasion and left to linger in a jail cell without further legal action.  His attorney, Michale Kraft made several appearances in court demanding that the government outline their specific charges, and release Karel.  Kraft had reached an agreement with the government that charges would be reduced and the Karel be released pending a trial, but Karel died two days before he was to go free.\nQuestions linger, however, about the manner of Karel\u2019s death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police \u2013whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death \u2013 would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation.\nThis \u201cthorough investigation\u201d lasted all of two weeks, including the time it took the Abila City Coroner to lose the original autopsy files.  After Karel\u2019s body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel\u2019s death stating that \u201cwe are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries.\u201d\nAs reported at the time of Karel\u2019s death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel\u2019s body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police.  These confidential sources have since moved from the area and have been unavailable for contact.\nPolice have denied anything unusual happened in Karel\u2019s death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence.\nYesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water.  \n\u201cBoth of them died because of government lies and corruption,\u201d one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.  \u201cJuliana died because Kronos allowed GAStech to poison our water, and Elian died because he tried to bring Juliana justice.  When will it end?\u201d\nAnother, larger crowd had gathered the day before in a nearby city park to bring public awareness about these same issues.  Amid the speeches and music, I heard the same message from the year before:  \u201cRemember Juliana! Remember Elian!\u201d\n",

He grew up with the specter of death all around him.   By the time Elian was 17 many of his family members and friends were battling constant illness, including his neighbor 10-year old Juliana Vann.\"\nMarek paused a moment to allow the cries of \"Remember Juliana!\" to fade.\n\"Elian devoted his life to the people of Elodis as well as all citizens of Kronos, as did his father before him.  Elian knew his would be a difficult journey.  He had watched his father, Jeroen and the founder of the POK, Henk Bodrogi walk the very path he would tread.  Elian knew the course would not be easy, and would leave little time for a personal life.  Yet he chose to take those steps despite the challenges he knew he would face.\"\n\"Elian's journey ended three years ago today.  But his dream did not die with him.  And it is that vision of a healthy and prosperous future for all we are here today to honor.\"\nOver the course of the afternoon several other speakers paid tribute to not only Elian, but all who have been victims of the environmental catastrophe brought about by greed and corruption of public officials. \nThe gathering was marred only by the aggravating presence of Abila police in riot gear.  The police agitated many of the crowd, causing them to have to leave the assembly rather than be assailed with batons and pepper spray.\n\n\n\n",

He had been arrested three months prior for spurious charges of tax evasion and left to linger in a jail cell without further legal action.  His attorney, Michale Kraft made several appearances in court demanding that the government outline their specific charges, and release Karel.  Kraft had reached an agreement with the government that charges would be reduced and the Karel be released pending a trial, but Karel died two days before he was to go free.\nQuestions linger, however, about the manner of Karel's death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police -whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death - would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation.\nThis \"thorough investigation\" lasted all of two weeks, including the time it took the Abila City Coroner to lose the original autopsy files.  After Karel's body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel's death stating that \"we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries.\"\nAs reported at the time of Karel's death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel's body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police.  These confidential sources have since moved from the area and have been unavailable for contact.\nPolice have denied anything unusual happened in Karel's death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence.\nYesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water.  \n\"Both of them died because of government lies and corruption,\" one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.  \"Juliana died because Kronos allowed GAStech to poison our water, and Elian died because he tried to bring Juliana justice.  When will it end?\"\nAnother, larger crowd had gathered the day before in a nearby city park to bring public awareness about these same issues.  Amid the speeches and music, I heard the same message from the year before:  \"Remember Juliana! Remember Elian!\"\n",

The citizens gathered hoping their voices would be heard by their elected officials. They handed out information on flyers printed and donated by local businesses about the lifestyle incongruities between today's elected officials and those of a few years ago. Demonstrators held posters of POK martyrs and chanted for social and economic parity, while black-clad members of the Abila Police formed faceless lines of shields, batons and side arms surrounding the crowds.\nOn everyone's mind was the question:  Who brings a gun to a peaceful sit in?  The rally had been publicized as a peaceful gathering of citizens to bring their concerns to the public consciousness.  The most dangerous item in their hands was a picture of a sweet-faced ten year dead old girl - Juliana Vann who died in 1998 of cancer caused by the benzene in her drinking water.  \nWhy did the Kronos government feel the need to send a police brute squad?\nDespite these heavy-handed efforts, as groups of people slipped through the barricades and moved through the streets to bring their message to the citizens of Kronos.  Flyers bringing messages of truth and justice were left on park benches, in coffee houses and on light poles.  \nHow can these officials - hypothetically getting by on public salaries - afford the second homes, large boats and luxury automobiles they flaunt?\n\n\n",

This article is an update.\nELODIS, Kronos - Ten-year old Juliana Vann died yesterday afternoon, surrounded by her family and friends.  The cause of death was leukemia due to benzene poisoning.\nJuliana had been sick for over a year.  Initially her family didn't realize that benzene poisoning was the cause of Juliana's problems.  After visits to many hospitals, a doctor associated with the international assistance organization Wellness For All recommended Juliana be tests for benzene poisoning.  At that point, however, the little girl's system was too damaged to recover.\nThe residents of Elodis have been pleading with the government of Kronos to take action against the pollution caused by the GAStech gas drilling operation just 20 km upstream from Elodis.\nJuliana's death is but one of several deaths this rural township has suffered because of toxic waste being dumped into the Tiskele River by Tethys corporation GAStech.\nPrivate funeral services will be held on August 21 in the family home.\n",

I've asked him to tell me about the involvement of the government of Kronos in the deeply troubling account of a community's struggle for protection from those who should help them the most: their elected officials, against those who would poison their children and the country's food.\n\"It took a long time for anyone to respond,\" Reese tells me of their struggle.  \"Henk Bodrogi - the man you met - didn't give up.  He called every department that could possibly be associated with our problem:  interior, justice, foreign affairs, health.    Henk and a few other residents made several trips to Abila trying to get someone to listen.  Finally, a sympathetic person from the Ministry of Health answered the door, so that's where we started.\"\nReese then describes months of meetings at which the government officials demanded documents proving their case:  health and crop yield statistics, the scientific test results from Wellness For All, and medical records.\n\"It's been frustrating.  We bring the documents they want, and then they want to confirm the results, or tell us to provide additional information or have closed door meetings.  We're currently in the process of negotiating a date for a hearing at the Ministry of Health to present our petition for assistance.\"\nHas it been worth it?\n\"You tell me,\" Reese nods out his window.

He was led - manacled - from a meeting of the Protectors of Kronos in Elodis, a rural township west of Abila.\nDemonstrating his trademark humor, Karel lifted his wrists and joked to his supporters as he is led away, \"I guess I shouldn't have sent the President those cases of bottled water for his birthday.\"\nKarel is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, an alliance of Kronos citizens from Elodis that has demanded the government clean up the contaminated water caused by gas drilling in their community.\n\"We didn't ask for GAStech to come to our community,\" Karel spoke at a rally a few months ago.  \"We didn't ask for our water to become undrinkable, for our children to become sick.  Neither Elodis nor the people of Kronos have received any benefit from the extraordinarily large amount of money that GAStech clears every year.  I ask:  Where is the money going?\"\nThe police representative assured supporters who massed outside the police station that Karel would be treated humanely, but declined to answer questions or allow visitors to see Karel.\n\"He's a determined man,\" Karel's attorney Michale Kraft told me over the phone. \"He'll fight these false charges and be out in a few days.  He'll probably complain about the jail food at the next POK rally.\" \nKraft plans to meet with Karel Saturday morning.\nCalls to the President and Minister of Justice offices were not immediately returned.\n\n",

Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm.\n \"We've worked the land for a long time - maybe 200 years, maybe a bit more,\" Henk Bodrogi told me as he picked over a container of bolts, searching for the right size.  \"Over the years we've added a few hectares here and there.  It keeps us busy.\"\nBusy is an understatement, as I found when I prodded the wiry farmer to tell me more.\n\"I usually head to the fields before sun up,\" Mr. Henk Bodrogi tells me. \"My wife gets the kids up and heading to school, then she'll make a little something for us to eat for lunch and work alongside me until dinner.  When the children get home from school they do their chores, and we're all back at the house most times by dark.\"\n\"We do this most days,\" he adds, \"except for worship days.\"\nBodrogi identifies the appropriate bolt and chats with the cashier about kids and school as he completes his purchase.\n\"We all know one another here,\" Bodrogi explains as we leave. \"Most families have lived here for generations.  The first new people that came to town were with that gas company that built a few years back.\"\nI ask Bodrogi if business has been good. \n\"We were doing pretty good until recently.  Profits were good and we add acreage, or upgrade equipment.  Then we started having all this trouble with the crops.\"\nIn what way, I asked.\n\"The crops aren't producing like they have in the past.  It took a while to figure out, then one of the city officers figured out to call in a water specialist.  When they tested it they said the water was contaminated.\"\nBodrodgi sighed, and with a beleaguered look in his eye he thanked me for my interest and told me he had to head back home.  The tractor had to be fixed before they could work the next day.  I thanked him and watched him climb into his truck and head out of town.\nThe water specialist turned out to be the international agency \"Wellness For All\", an international agency with a mission to bring healthy water to communities distressed by natural disasters, draught and - coincidentally - oil and gas development.\nI caught up with a representative from Wellness for All the next day.  Joclyn Reynolds is project coordinator for \"Wellness for All\".  She spoke to me over a satellite call from her field office in Southeast Asia where she was setting up relief efforts following an earthquake. Ms. Reynolds agreed to speak to me for a few minutes between meetings about their work in Elodis.\n\"We were contacted by a city official about a problem they were having with their local water.  In the last few years agriculture had foundered, and the incidence of certain illnesses and birth defects had risen.  The Elodis drinking water comes from the Tiskele River, as does all the water for farming, so we looked for a source upstream.  We found sources of production waste disposal at the GAStech operation upstream.  Tests showed high levels of benzene, toluene, xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, among other toxins. \"\n\"Can these substances occur naturally?\" I asked her.\n\"Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly.  Groundwater contamination is usually the result of human activity.  The GAStech pipes are releasing contaminants into a pond.  The toxins are forming a subsurface plume that seeps into the Tiskele River from which the residents of Elodis draw their drinking water and irrigation for the crops.\"\n\"Did you talk to GAStech about this?\"\n\"Oh yes,\" she replied.  \"At first we believed we were gaining traction.  We met several times with GAStech representatives, including one of the senior executives, Hank Fluss.  He personally assured us GAStech would act responsibly to provide material and financial assistance toward cleanup efforts.  After a time, though, it became clear that while Mr. Fluss was earnest it was Sanjorge who makes the decisions.  It is apparent that he [Sanjorge] has no interest in the wellbeing of the residents of Elodis, or the environment.\"\nSten Sanjorge, Jr., who had inherited his share in the company from his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for cutthroat business practices.\n\"When we didn't make headway with GAStech,\" Reynolds continued, \"the community leaders decided to approach the government of Kronos for assistance.   Per our policy -and with permission from the Elodis leaders - we published the test results in an official public document.  The Elodis leaders then approached the government officials as citizens of a Kronesian community armed with the scientific analysis.  Our agency assured them we would again be available to help in any way when those agreements were finalized.\"\nAt this point Ms Reynolds was called away from the phone, so I returned to my editor friend, Pondo Reese to tell finish the story.\nPart Three will be published May 15, 1998\n",

The five POK activists had gathered in front of the gates to GAStech gas drilling operations facility to bring public awareness about the polluted Tiskele River which has caused health problems to the residents of Elodis.\nBystanders report that the demonstration had begun peacefully with the five POK members walking back and forth across the road, chanting \"Remember Juliana!\" and \"No more poison!\"  \nAn eyewitness told the Homeland Illumination that when the gates opened to allow GAStech company vehicles to exit the facility the protesters moved aside.  Witnesses agree that at the same time vehicles with the Government of Kronos seal drove to the gates, apparently planning to enter the facility. \n\"It was all very civil up till then,\" Griffith Mabel, an Elodis resident who had come out to support the POK told the Homeland Illumination.   \"The gates opened, the POK people moved and the trucks drove out.  That's when it got weird.  The trucks stopped in the middle of the road for no reason.\"\nAnother eyewitness, Elodis farmer Charley Normand adds, \"Yeah, the POK guys asked the drivers to move nicely, but the GAStech drivers ignored them.  They had their windows down, so it wasn't like they couldn't hear them.\"\nThe occupants of the government vehicles exited and joined the altercation.  The sequence of events becomes confusing at this point.  Some witnesses state the GAStech drivers instigated arguments with the protestors, and others think the government officials began to strong arm the protesters from the road.\n\"Turns out the people in the government cars were police,\" Mabel tells the Homeland Illumination.  \"They wore uniforms and had badges.\"\nOnlookers tell the Homeland Illumination that the three parties began yelling, and at some point the Kronos police - presumably from Abila-  arrested the five activists and transported them to an Elodis jail.\nDespite repeated requests for an interview, the Homeland Illumination has not been granted access to those arrested.\n \n",

Following the 86-14 vote last month the Minister of the Interior Tomas Sarto lauded the decision as \"landmark\" and \"bettering the people\".\nWe shall see.  The crafters of these revolutionary measures neglected to include a detailed plan about how this windfall would benefit everyday Kronosians.  When the first payment from these foreign company lands in the state coffers, how will these funds be dispersed?\nOne wonders:  Did the 14 who opposed the measure feel the same way?  Were they also wondering exactly how this money would be funneled into education, improvements in roads, utilities and healthcare?\nCalls to the offices of the President were not returned.\n\n",

Bouro.  Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos.\nTwo weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around Tiskele Bend. In his email he described a once bountiful region now distressed by contamination, struggling to find solutions to a worsening problem.  I decided to investigate.\n\"We didn't make the connection at first,\" Reese told me when I met with him at his office.  \"The gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away.   After a couple of harvests, we saw a decline in the production.   We thought perhaps it was just a hiccup, and things would get better.  Then when the kids started getting sick we took a harder look at what could have changed.\"\nThe change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out of Tethys.\nEstablished in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis.\nWith a population of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a caf\u00e9 where you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations.\n\"We've made a good living for a long time,\" Reese tells me. \"The population has been steadily increasing.  Crop production has been good.  For the most part, kids haven't left for the city as they have in a lot of other rural places.  We have a lot of land that could yet be developed. There was a future for them here.\"\nI asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech's operations.  He introduced me to a farmer whose family had been here for several generations.  \nI caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at the Osvaldo hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm.\nPart Two will be published April 25, 1998\n\n",

Karel was being held on fraudulent tax evasion charges after his arrest on March 12 earlier this year.\nHis attorney, Michale Kraft made the announcement Friday during a noon press conference.\n\"We don't know any details yet.  What I can tell you is that when I left Elian yesterday after meeting with him in the prison he was in excellent health and good spirits.  He was expecting to be released in the next few days and return to his work with the Protectors of Kronos, and was excited to continue the Protectors of Kronos mission to which he dedicated his life.  I can assure you that Elian's death will be investigated with all the resources at our disposal and those responsible will be brought to justice.\"\nSupporters of the POK and others began gathering outside the police station as news spread.\n\"I can't believe it,\" Kriste Brontes said through her tears, \"We were at the rally in March.  He looked and sounded so good.  He was so optimistic that changes were coming.  Who will be able to lead POK now?\"\nKarel, from Elodis, had been involved with the POK mission since he was young.  He was only a few years older than Juliana Vann, a friend who died in 1998 of toxin poisoning caused by illegal dumping from the Tethyn company GAStech. \nCalls to the President's office, the office of the Minister of Justice and the office of the Chief of Police were not immediately returned.\n\n",

Protesters were demanding an accounting of the government revenues from then President Araullo's tax incentives that were signed into law in 1993.\nTen-year old Juliana Vann died in 1998 from an illness caused by contaminated water from GAStech drilling operations. She has become the heart-rending icon of a movement that has gained support from one end of Kronos to the other.\n\"We were promised better jobs, new roads, better healthcare and a better standard of living,\" said one 20-year old protestor who declined to have her name used.  \"All I see are bigger mansions for the ministers and a hospital that costs more to fix than it can make.  We won't accept that!\"\nThe protestor was referring to Abila General Hospital built in 1997 ostensibly with money from the increased revenue from the foreign gas operations here on Kronos.  The non-profit hospital has had difficulty maintaining its infrastructure, despite the extensive restoration performed sevearl years ago to replace the electrical and plumbing systems.\n\"The contracts were all given to family and cronies of the ministers,\" accuses 26-year old Jon L., who traveled six hours to attend yesterday's rally.  \"What we need is transparency in our government.  We need to know what happens to all the money coming in from these foreign companies.\nProtest leader Elian Karel addressed the demonstrators at Abila City park.  Karel took over POK leadership from Henk Bodrogi, whose ill health forced him down from the position.  Karel spoke eloquently about the beginnings of the POK campaign as a grassroots effort for clean water, to the dynamic movement it has become demanding improved government transparency and accountability.\n\"We aren't asking for anything unreasonable,\" Karel speaks passionately to his ardent listeners.  \"All we want is to know how our taxes are being used.  We know these corporations are generating records profits at the expense of Kronos, but we see none of the promised improvements.  All we want is accountability for those who died because of greed, corruption and disregard of those who they should be protecting.\"\nCalls to the President's office were not immediately returned.\n\n",

He was attended only by apathetic guards who had been charged with detaining him pending an investigation for tax fraud.  Instead, sometime in the early morning hours of 19 June, Elian Karel died with injuries inexplicable with the official cause of death.\nThe report released by the Abila City Coroner in July 2010 attributed Karel's death to sudden cardiac arrest, and the investigation was closed shortly thereafter.  Unnamed sources close to the investigation, however, have provided witness testimony that Karel's body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which occurred within hours before his death.\nPolice have denied anything unusual happened in Karel's death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence.\nIn the year since Karel's death the Protectors of Kronos have continued the mission to demand that the Kronos government implement a policy of transparency in government business, and to hold accountable the foreign companies that have contaminated Kronosian natural resources.\nSupporters continue to mass in public places, determined that their cries for justice be heard.  Now intermixed with chants of \"Remember Juliana!\" one can also hear cries \"Remember Elian!\"\n\n\n",

The POK rally was intended to draw attention to their claims of environmental damage being caused by the development of gas and oil fields around Kronos by foreign corporations like GAStech.  About two hundred people gathered in front of the GAStech building chanting slogans and waving signs that held the visages of people who have allegedly died due to environmental contamination.  Ten of the protestors chained themselves to the doors of the building in an attempt to prevent GAStech employees from going to work.\n\nPolice spokesman Adrien Carman said, \"We allowed the group some latitude with their rally, but when GAStech complained that the protestors were blocking entrance to their building, we had to take action.

In the past it has had a reputation as corrupt and environmentally harmful, but nowadays GAStech, the former Tethys-only business, is trying to earn the trust of international investors. This forms part of its ambitions to expand its profitable business supplying gas outside of the Mediterranean region.\n\nIt is an uphill task, and there is no certainty that Gastech has the ability to convince potential investors it has mended its ways, and is no longer rooted in the eco-hostile past.\nGAStech's pipeline operations are based in eastern Kronos, and there is close relationship with the Kronosian government. This is the heart of Kronos's pipeline business, where gas from the eastern gas fields is piped west towards the rest of Kronos, Tethys and Europe.\n\nGAStech does more than just pump gas. It has created towns and cities to service its operations, which it manages and runs almost single-handed.\nThe head of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, whose photo stares out from calendars and picture frames everywhere in the country, acknowledges the \"state within a state\" accusations, but argues that the company simply needs to look after its workers and the communities around them.\n\nOf course, people need good reasons to come and work in the hostile remote Kronosian regions. They are provided with medical care, entertainment, and food. The GAStech empire owns 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its company farms, runs gyms, and offers subsidised holidays in Black Sea resorts for key employees. For executives, it runs a state of the art, marble-lined medical and therapy centre.\n\nIn addition to all of these perks, there is also the GAStech TV station, which doesn't even pretend to be unbiased. It's there to serve the company's will.\n\nIt hardly seems the picture of a modern global company, as most of those have unceremoniously dumped their \"non-core activities\". There is an argument, however, that the energy business is different from other industries, requiring energy corporations to operate in distinct ways.\n\nWorking in far-off places with no previous infrastructure means oil and gas sites will always be, to some extent, company towns. GAStech certainly strives to ensure its employees can move in and out of these locations by operating a private fleet of four planes to ferry its staff the huge distances between sites.\n",

Karel died Wednesday while serving time in jail. The government of Kronos refuses comment on the circumstances of his death.\n\nRather charismatic, Karel was able to inspire a crowd and draw attention to the POK social and political agenda.  He could also tickle the funny bone of his audiences.  Once, after GAStech CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. likened the POK to a terrorist group in a press interview, Karel  quipped, \"Sanjorge is a brilliant leader of GAStech. Do you know why he takes a ladder with him to the supermarket?  He heard that food prices in Abila are really high.\"\n\nHowever, his ability to engage ultimately with the strong armed Kronos government had never been clear.

He is optimistic that he can identify the source.\n\n\"These designer drugs have certain clues as to their origin,\" Loblaw told the Times in an interview.  \"Every time the recipe is changed, it leaves clues as to who made it.  It's like a pedigree.\"\n\nThis particular blend of the drug MDMC, also known by its street names \"cotton candy\", \"spice dreams\" and \"Tulip Blossom\", was found previously only in Asteria but has made its way to the streets of Tethys and other international countries.\n\n\"I'll be looking hard at the activities of the Asterian People's Army,\" Loblaw said.  \"Our previous investigations pointed to them as the source of this particular formulation.\"\n\nThe Asterian People's Army (APA) is a paramilitary organization which has been engaged in terrorist activities funded through its criminal enterprises, which include drug trafficking.  In recent years the APA has sought to build their brand through websites and the publication of a professional, high-quality magazine called \"Arise\".\n\nSenior Inspector Loblaw says the Tethys public statistics indicate MDMC is a growing problem with the country's youth.  \"An increase in mental health problems, including hallucinations and paranoia, accompanied by violent behavior and a marked increase in suicide rates are only a few of the indicators of the usage of this designer drug.\"\n\n\"As a first step we have alerted port officials to be on the lookout for suspicious shipments of insecticides and detergent, both similar in appearance to MDMC.\"\n\n\n\n",

Dr. Jayala Mahmed was unable to find an existing organization to sponsor her to volunteer her medical services there.  CARING Singapore has sent five missions to Kosovo to provide mobile medical care.  They have also launched a fundraising effort in collaboration with the governments of Malaysia.  \"We stand ready to help, but funding is difficult to find,\" stated Dr. Mahmed. \"So much is needed but so much has already been spent.\"\nThirteen people were injured on Tuesday in Izmit, Turkey, as people mobbed a government relief convoy, officials said.  Some 20,000 people are feared dead in the two earthquakes that have occurred this year.  CARING Singapore has dispatched relief teams to Turkey.\n\nYet, aid organizations are stretched to their limits.  Wellness for All assisted ad-hoc emergency medical teams during the September earthquake in central Taiwan that measured 7.3 on the Richter scale.  \"The response from the Emergency Teams was impressive, but uncoordinated,\" stated a Wellness for All spokesperson.  \"We were never sure if we were headed to locations most desperate.  We soon ran out of medicines and funds to support our aid teams and had to return home.\"  While the global press reported over 2500 people were killed and 100,000 buildings were destroyed, local press reported people felt they were being properly cared for and declined relief aid. \nThe Global Emergency Disaster Organization report their members are doing all they can to get aid through to earthquake victims, but they need a huge injections of funds to do so.  \nJim Cordon, from the disaster relief charity FoodSupport told the times \"I think that the lack of funds are responsible for an increase of attacks on food convoys, consequently deterring a lot of aid agencies from getting in there.\"\n\n\n",

      "text": "SOURCE: International Times\nTITLE: Centrum's central role in the Tethan Gas Industry \n\nPUBLISHED: 2 October 1982\n\nThe world of gas is distant, difficult and far flung. In Tethys a few years ago, I journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of Tethys to look at a contentious new energy producing area.\nOne of the sites I visited was a local office of the Sanjorge Gas company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation. As I remember it, a former trucker was in charge.\nIt was a vivid example of how a once small exploration company from Thethys had begun to grow into a mighty international force in the energy industry.\nBut I'd forgotten about the encounter until I went back to Tethys the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: one man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it.\nBut as I went round the capital city of Centrum interviewing people, I soon realised that this was not just a story of new energy. Something very significant has happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas industry expertise. From what's developed in the capital city there are important lessons for other places blessed (and cursed) with abundant natural resources.\n\"Centrum developed world class expertise in engineering in very difficult surroundings\"\n\nWhen I was a young newspaperman on the Daily Record in Glasgow in the early 1970s, the great off-shore oil rush was beginning in the North Sea. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, turning an island of coal into a place with abundant oil and gas supplies.\nIt seemed to us on the west coast of Scotland that the far flung city of Centrum, Tethys was getting a bit big for its boots, starting to believe in a new fantasy industry.\nMuch to his mother's regrets, meanwhile, Sten Sanjorge had started prospecting in the early 1960s.\n\nBy the early 1970s, a new gas company, GAStech, began its juggernaut-like advances.\nUnder his canny guidance, GAStech evolved into a major supplier of natural gas to the local region, and then much further afield. It now has thousands employees and operates in numerous countries. \n\nThe change in Centrum has been substantial.  You notice them in the constant clutter of helicopters to-ing and fro-ing out to remote areas, and the planes lined up at the city's airport to shuttle execs back and forth from the city.\nAnd as you drive round Centrum, almost every roundabout is sponsored by a division of GAStech. \n\nSanjorge has recently started paying more attention to leisure activities and philanthropy, allowing his son Sten Jr. and co-founder Hank Fluss to run the company. But Sanjorge has just been asked to produce a report for the Tethan government recommending the best ways of ensuring that Tethys continues to produce energy for decades to come.\n\nThe easy-to-get stuff has been produced, so keeping the gas coming will need much investment and more clever new techniques, such as the hyper-acidic substrate removal techniques developed by the company in 1974. \nSo thanks to clever people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, Centrum has achieved what every place where raw materials are discovered longs to do. The city has taken the temporary boon of energy on its doorstep, and turned it into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which may make Centrum a centre of gas expertise long after the gas itself runs out.\n\n",

Investigators are awaiting toxicology reports to determine the cause of his death. Citywide, several deaths have been attributed to \"Cotton Candy\" according to the Kronos National Poison Center.\n\n\nPatients are coming to Abila General from throughout the greater city region, and they include adults and youths, male and female, and all socio-economic backgrounds, Bianca said.\n\n\nSgt Antonio Arresta of the Abila Fire Department, a first-responder to emergency medical calls in the city, said his department has also seen a spike in the number of people needing treatment for complications from designer drugs. \"We went from zero calls to a handful of calls\" in the last month,\" he said.\nBianca and Arresta said their efforts to treat people is made more difficult because they often do not know anything about the designer drugs that were taken.\n\"You don't know what you're getting when you get it,\" Bianca said. \"We have had patients come in and act out of control, who are very violent. They tell us they have been doing cotton candy or synthetic marijuana.\"\nBianca said there is little clinical data on the effects of cotton candy, as it is an emerging toxicant. \"There are no controlled studies in toxicology,\" she said. The national poison center collects anecdotal reports on overdoses from hospitals and other providers as part of efforts to offer advice on how to treat patients.\nDesigner drugs are chemical compounds synthesized to resemble the active ingredient in often illegal drugs. Cotton candy mimics the drug khat, a stimulant. Manufacturers frequently change the designer drug's chemical composition and its name to stay one step ahead of authorities, Biance said. \"It is another way to sell it,\" she said.\nThe term cotton candy, for example, is a nickname of the drug and has nothing to do with the carnival treat. The drug has been sold under the name of \"Spice Dreams\" one week and under the name of \"Tulip Blossom\" the next. \nThe Kronos government has placed three of the chemicals commonly used in the creation of cotton candy on its controlled substance list, criminalizing their use and possession. Still, the government cannot outright ban cotton candy because manufacturers can alter the recipe and skirt the law, Bianca said. The drugs are sold online as \"herbal therapy\" products and are available over the counter in area stores.\n\"We still don't know what you are getting with cotton candy. The chemical composition varies from package to package,\" Bianca said.\nOne factor for the popularity of cotton candy is its low cost, Bianca said. She said a gram of cotton candy costs about K18 while a gram of cocaine costs K166.\n\nCotton candy creates euphoria, or a high, that is equal to or greater than that of cocaine but also causes a crash that is worse, Bianca said. The crash's ill-effects often prompt people to binge on cotton candy to the point where they consume the drug for days. \"They crave it,\" she said.\nAfter repeated use, the drug \"fries\" a person's brain, draining the chemicals that balance its operations. This sometimes leads to bizarre, often psychotic behavior that has been reported in the media, such as the case of the naked man in Elodis who was found running down the middle of a major highway, Bianca said. \"The seizures and delusions are incredible,\" she said.\nWhile it is not yet certain who is behind the distribution of this round of designer drugs, police suspect organized crime is pursuing this large income source. The Asterian People's Army has traditionally been involved with drug trafficking throughout the region, and enforcement agencies are closely examining possible cooperation between drug trafficking organizations and political insurgent groups.\n\n\n",

Exploration has proved a controversial issue in Kronos>>\nContinue reading the main story\t\nThe son of the founder of gas firm GAStech is planning a venture to drill in the Mediterranean Sea, the Times has learned.\nSten Sanjorge, Jr. believes there are large volumes of offshore gas that could be extracted.\nSanjorge and GAStech were awarded three licences by the Kronos government last month by the Ministry for Energy and Development and hopes to begin exploration soon.\n\"Certainly offshore gas isn't a new concept, but there's no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can't develop these resources offshore,\" he told the Times.\n\nShale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within.\n\nHyper-acidic substrate removal has produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the West, transforming the energy market. But projects in Europe have been slow to take off, beset with opposition from government and local communities.\nSanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited.\n\nMany environmentalists believe that hyper-acidic substrate removal can damage marine environments, and oppose the extraction of new fossil fuel resources. But drilling offshore avoids the need for difficult negotiations with local councils, communities and landholders.\n\nBased on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech's estimates for its onshore resources. There is also the possibility of finding oil.\nGAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore.\n\n\"We're very comfortable that the resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous,\" SanJorge said. \"Is any of that exploitable? That's the billion dollar question, and GAStech is wiling to invest in the answer.\"\n\nThough it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done.\nProfessor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term.\n\n\"GAStech is being optimistic is its estimates of how long it will take to explore offshore shale. It's perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyper-acidic substrate removal technology will have so advanced and the way in which we deal with the offshore environment will have so advanced that this could be a really big industry. The task in the next 10 years is to try these things out, see if they work.\" \n",

The POK rally was intended to draw attention to their claims of environmental damage being caused by the development of gas and oil fields around Kronos by foreign corporations like GAStech.  About two hundred people gathered in front of the GAStech building chanting slogans and waving signs that held the visages of people who have allegedly died due to environmental contamination.  Ten of the protestors chained themselves to the doors of the building in an attempt to prevent GAStech employees from going to work.\n\nPolice spokesman Adrien Carman said, \"We allowed the group some latitude with their rally, but when GAStech complained that the protestors were blocking entrance to their building, we had to take action.  The last thing we wanted to happen was for a GAStech employee to get hurt by the crowd just because he was trying to go to work.\"\n\nThe POK, once a small political activist group of citizens from the Elodis area, has been revitalization under the charismatic leadership of Elian Karel.

The POK thugs crept up on two patrol officers who were sitting in their vehicle and ambushed the men, bashing the windows of their car and dragging them out of the vehicle into the street.  The officers were beaten, then tied and left in the trunk of their vehicle.  The criminals then proceeded to deface the car with spray-painted POK logos.\n\n\"Assaulting a police officer and destroying government property are serious crimes,\" Carmen said.  \"I want to assure the public that these men will be caught and brought to justice soon.\"\n\n",

The proposed tax increase, championed by Minister of Health Cesare Nespola, was to provide specific funding for health care, clean water projects, and health education for rural areas.  Minister Nespola said of the Assembly vote, \"I'm disappointed by the vote, but the Assembly was concerned that the increase in tax would discourage foreign investment in our energy sector.  This is a setback to my program to help our rural townships, but I am nothing if not persistent.  My office will be sending a revised added tax measure to the Assembly later this year.  Additionally, I will work with President Kapelou's office to restructure the allocation of funds from current gas and oil taxes to provide for rural health projects.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The protestors, members of the activist group \"Protectors of Kronos\", held signs reading: \"Drilling Poisoned Our Water\" and \"Remember Juliana\", referring to 10 year old Juliana Vann, who has become an icon for the Protectors of Kronos since her death in 1998.  The protestors were arrested after one young man threw his sign at a government vehicle, cracking its window and startling the occupants.  Police spokesman Adrien Carman said of the arrests, \"We decided to shut the protest down before the POK members escalated to further violence.  They were getting pretty animated out there.\"\n\n\"These 'Protectors of Kronos' are really a fringe minority of people against the extraction of fossils fuels in our country,\" said Government spokesman Carmine Gurganus.  \"The people of Kronos have overwhelmingly been for the development of our natural resources and all have benefited from the resultant economic growth.  These activists clearly don't understand the whole picture.\"\n\n\n\n",

Police called for the peaceful end to the sit-ins, but were answered with a barrage of rocks and bottles from the crowd.  The violence escalated into a full blown riot and police were forced to use tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons, and beanbags shot from shotguns to control the crowd.  \n\nBy the time the crowds finally dispersed, several government buildings had been vandalized, two police vehicles were ablaze, and the streets were littered with trash and broken glass.

Today's Abila is a bustling metropolis full of new cars, new construction, gleaming office buildings, and modern conveniences.  Gone are the potholed streets, run-down factories, tired storefronts, and sad marketplaces of the past.  Today's Abila is a city of industry, a place of commerce and investment, a place of opportunity and success.  Prosperity has come to Kronos, and we are all the better for it.\n\nHowever, there are still those who wrongly think that prosperity is bad for us.  These people claim that foreign investment is bad for our country, that it is diluting our culture and undermining our values.  They claim that the foreigners are exploiting us for their own gain and that our government has little regard for the welfare of our people.  They are so militant in their wrong-headed beliefs that they have fabricated claims that the foreign companies are poisoning our children with their technology.  They have even gone so far as to have brought in foreign \"experts\" who claim to \"have our best interests at heart\" to help spread their agenda against progress and prosperity for our people.

When we contacted Minister Sarto's office for comment, he said, \"We were astounded by the results of GAStech's recent survey of Tiskele Bend.  I mean, this is just huge for the people of Kronos.  We have already undertaken several large improvement projects like the port expansion and the new hospital that we would not otherwise have been able to do because of the taxes we are seeing from our foreign investments.  This news almost assures we'll be able to reap those same dividends for decades to come!\"\n\nIt goes without saying that President Araullo's plan to lure foreign investment has been a defining moment in our history.  One hopes that those who had been so shortsighted as to oppose his plan have finally come to their senses.  We will say what they are too proud to say: Thank you, Mr. President. \n\n\n\n\n",

The old Abila General Hospital, built in 1930, has outdated health care facilities and has suffered numerous electrical fires in the past decade.  Hospital Administrator Torsten Trucco lauded the government's action saying, \"We've been trying to get funding to update our facilities for years, to no avail.  We have been living on borrowed time for quite a while now with the old boiler.  It's been pure luck that the old girl hasn't failed on us completely.\"\n\nThe new Abila General will have 350 beds, a substantial upgrade from the mere 100 beds of the current antiquated facility.  Additionally, it will have a full emergency services area, trauma and burn care units, a psychiatric care wing, and four ultra-modern surgical suites.  In his announcement of the new construction, Araullo said, \"Our strategy of courting foreign investment is paying great dividends.  This new hospital is the first of many projects we plan to pursue to help upgrade our standard of living and modernize our lifestyle.\"\n\n\n\n\n",

The POK had gathered in memorialize their former leader, Elian Karel, who died of natural causes in jail last year.  POK supporters carried signs with pictures of Karel and Juliana Vann, chanted slogans, and lit candles. \n\nThe peaceful demonstration turned violent when two POK members accosted a man who attempted to enter the building on business.  The POK members hit him with a bottle, which knocked him to the ground and gave him a bloody gash on his forehead.  Abila police attempted to gain control of the situation by using bullhorns to call for the peaceful dispersal of the crowd, but the crowd responded to their calls by hurling insults along with a few rocks at the officers.  Police used tear gas to end the gathering, but a handful of die-hard POK members urged the crowd into melee with the officers.  Additional security forces had to be summoned to help contain the situation as the violence escalated.  When the tear gas finally cleared, six POK member were arrested on charges of assault on civil authorities and inciting a crowd to violence.  Three police officers were treated at Abila General Hospital for wounds received in the fight.\n\n\"We had been concerned that Silvia Marek's weak leadership is allowing the POK to be taken over by criminals and hooligans.  Today's events show that our concerns were valid,\" said police spokesman Adrien Carman.  Marek replaced Elian Karel as the popular figurehead of the POK movement last summer.\n",

Minister Nespola said, \"We have no reason to believe that the drilling at Tiskele Bend has resulted in any contamination of surface or well water in the region.  However, I believe it is important as Minister of Health to do due diligence and investigate the reports of sickness near the Elodis township.  Taking care of our people is my number one priority.\"\n\nIn related news, a press release from Nespola's office proclaimed that his office has granted a license to practice medicine to a Tethys oncologist, making him the first licensed oncologist in Kronos history.  Dr. Ronald Gerard will be a resident at the Abila General Hospital.\n\n\n\n\n",

Tomas Sarto, Minister of the Interior, lauded the vote as \"a landmark deal designed to better the lives of all Kronosians\".  \n\nThe tax incentives specifically target energy development companies, which the government hopes to lure to Kronos' rich, but yet undeveloped, gas fields.  Ministry of the Interior projections show that development of just the Tiskele Bend fields could bring in as many as 5,000 high paying jobs and yield billions of dollars of infrastructure development over the next 20 years.    \n\n\n\n\n",

GAStech, under the leadership of visionary Sten Sanjorge Jr., was awarded exclusive rights to drill in the government-owned fields after agreeing to the government's request that 50% or more of the workforce be Kronosian citizens.  President Araullo hailed the landmark deal as \"the beginning of a new era for our great country, an era of opportunity and fortune for all.\"  Our sources at the Ministry of Interior tell us that the 50% tax levied on new oil and gas exploration could yield in excess of $1 billion in tax revenue per year.

Before police made the arrests shortly after 9 a.m., the protesters were told they were breaking the law for trespassing on government property, blocking access to government-owned land, and impeding lawful commercial traffic. \n\nThe protesters arrived at the entrance to the Tiskele Bend site about 5:30 a.m. and locked arms across the road for about three hours, despite being asked to leave by police.  As traffic on the road began to back up, several truck drivers began to leave their vehicles and congregate near the protesters.  Tempers began to flare as the blockade persisted into the second hour, and the drivers started shouting and cursing at the protesters to move out of the road.  Police officers quickly moved in and arrested the POK protesters before the situation could escalate to violence.  \n\n\"We appreciate citizens voicing their opinion, but the middle of a busy road is not the right forum for a discussion of our national environmental policy. We encourage our concerned citizens to follow the democratic process and contact their Assembly representatives,\" government spokesman Rufus Drymiau said in a statement.\n\n\n\n",

Citywide, several deaths have been attributed to \"Cotton Candy\" according to the Kronos National Poison Center. \n\nDesigner drugs are chemical compounds synthesized to resemble the active ingredient in often illegal drugs. Cotton candy mimics the drug khat, a stimulant. Manufacturers frequently change the designer drug's chemical composition and its name to stay one step ahead of authorities, Biance said. \n\nThe term cotton candy, for example, is a nickname of the drug and has nothing to do with the carnival treat.  \n\nThe Kronos government has placed three of the chemicals commonly used in the creation of cotton candy on its controlled substance list, criminalizing their use and possession. Still, the government cannot outright ban cotton candy because manufacturers can alter the recipe and skirt the law, Bianca said. She said a gram of cotton candy costs about K18 while a gram of cocaine costs K166. The crash's ill-effects often prompt people to binge on cotton candy to the point where they consume the drug for days. The Asterian People's Army has traditionally been involved with drug trafficking throughout the region, and enforcement agencies are closely examining possible cooperation between drug trafficking organizations and political insurgent groups.\n\n",

The GAStech empire owns 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its company farms, runs gyms, and offers subsidised holidays in Black Sea resorts for key employees.

The Elodis drinking water comes from the Tiskele River, as does all the water for farming, so we looked for a source upstream.

However, the protests have turned violent with smashed windows and vandalized shops.\n\nCountless shop windows smashed in and around Siopa, the downtown shopping area.

Several buildings were defaced with the above mentioned slogans as well.\n\nThe Kronos government issued a statement, \"This sort of violence will not be condoned.

However, the government report stops short of blaming GAStech International and its Tiskele Bend site 20 km upstream as the people of Elodis assert. \n\nThe government report cites no root cause or causes can be determined at this time with more research and investigations needed. Indeed, \"pointing a finger of blame at this time would be hasty and most likely detrimental to the investigation.\"\n\nThough the report admits some contamination it goes on the qualify the level stating, \"The minor level of contamination is well within international health standards agreed upon by the Government of Kronos and GAStech International as negotiated in the Tiskele Bend site contract.\"\n\nThe Government of Kronos continues to offer well testing for concerned residents of Elodis as well as plans to further investigate the root causes of the illnesses in and around the township. \n",

What we know for certain is that 14 GAStech employees are not only missing, but kidnapped as confirmed by a Kronos Government source. At this time it is unclear who the missing are and whether they are citizens of Kronos of Tethys, as many GAStech employees are Tethan.\n\nThere is still speculation regarding who was taken in the kidnapping and whether GAStech President and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. was the target, given that GAStech International has yet to make a statement to the press. Speculation about the motives of the kidnappers has been rampant due to the recent news of the GAStech Initial Public Offering only a month ago.\n\nAt this time no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. Edvard Vann, a GAStech - Kronos security guard who was interrogated and released after 6 hours, gave the indication that the Protectors of Kronos were involved or at least suspected as being the perpetrators behind today's events.\n\nA GAStech International senior security executive has been on site to support the investigation aiding the Abila Police Department and Kronos Government officials.\n\nJanuary 20th was GAStech's annual corporate meeting with a Kronos Government reception to follow. Shortly after the morning meeting ended at 10:00, Abila Fire Department trucks responded to reports of a fire at the GAStech office.\n\n",

Lately the protests have turned violent escalating into rioting largely directed at the Tiskele Bend site.\n\nThe latest event involved POK protesters forming a human chain to block the entrance of GAStech's Tiskele Bend site.

We are working closely - the government and GAStech - to ensure that all environmental issues are resolved.\"\n\nSeveral instances of rioting in and around Elodis have been reported including the trashing of government buildings, rock throwing, and tire burnings.

But not only who are they, what and why are they protesting? \n\nThe Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis on the advice of the now defunct Wellness for All (WFA), an international water safety group. The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts that GAStech International's Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis. \n\nIn 1998, WFA performed testing on the water of Elodis finding high levels of benzene, toluene and xylene arsenic, barium, chromium, lead and selenium. The testing a subsequent statement released by WFA brought international attention and pressure on the government and GAStech to act. However, with the fragmenting of WFA due to funding issues, the POK's demands were largely ignored and downplayed. \n\nAlso in 1998, Juliana Vann, a previously healthy ten-year old girl died of a lingering illness, which WFA-funded doctors claimed was caused by water contamination. The Government of Kronos officially refuted the claim citing the fragmentation of the WFA organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted. Regardless, Juliana became the POK's first martyr and has used Juliana's image on campaign literature ever since. \n\nThe POK's second major martyr is Elian Karel, who died in 2009 while incarcerated of undetermined causes. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion. Karel had been involved with the POK since its inception given that his father, Jeroen Karel, was an original member.  Elian Karel's death in 2009 was marked by spontaneous instances of protest around Abila. The anniversary of his death, June 19, has seen additional protests, demonstrations, riots, and violence. \n\nThe POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people. As of 2011, the Government of Kronos has labeled the POK as a \"public threat\".\n\n\n\n\n\n",

However, officials still have not confirmed a kidnapping has taken place. The number of missing employees is undetermined at this time given the earlier confusion with the false fire alarm.\n\nThere is some indication that the Protectors of Kronos - an activist group responsible for many recent demonstrations and riots in and around Abila - are suspected of being responsible for the kidnapping.

Police point out a dramatic increase in drug related arrests that may be linked to violent activist groups. \n\nThe port of Abila is known to be a transshipment point for drugs coming from the Middle East and Africa going to Europe namely heroin and hashish. However, drug related arrests had remained flat over the past decade until the recent increase. \n\nThe concerns over the increase of drug related arrests are two-fold: first, violent activist groups such as the Protectors of Kronos could be using drug sales as a means to fund their activities; and second, with more drugs appearing on the shore, the people of Kronos will suffer increased drug related issues, namely addiction and violence.\n",

The rally outside of GAStech International's headquarters resulted in multiple arrests for trespassing.\n\nAbout two hundred people gathered in front of the GAStech building chanting slogans and waving signs that held the visages of people who have allegedly died due to environmental contamination.  Ten of the protestors chained themselves to the doors of the building in an attempt to prevent GAStech employees from going to work.\n\nPolice spokesman Adrien Carman said, \"We allowed the group some latitude with their rally, but when GAStech complained that the protestors were blocking entrance to their building, we had to take action.  The last thing we wanted to happen was for a GAStech employee to get hurt by the crowd just because he was trying to go to work.\"\n\nGovernment officials have expressed concern for the \"pattern of increasingly aggressive tactics by the Protectors of Kronos.\" In response to increased aggression from the POK, additional security will be provided to ensure public safety for all future rallies.\n\nGAStech officials declined to comment at this time indicating an official statement will be issued on the incident.\n",

However, he has records beginning as oil and gasprospector in Tethys. \n\nHe spoke to The Times concerning the appetites of a successful LEADER in Kronos and which foreign CEOs in the market can expect. \n\nQ: What is possible foreign CEOs when they to Kronos expects come?\n\nA: The economic environment has changed for the eighties. It is succeed much today more with difficulty. Foreign need CEOs their minimize expectations. There are easily none wins in Kronos. The competition under Kronosian and foreign firms is tough. It is difficult the harten and win the opinions of the population.\n\nBut there is less difference than people between culture Kronosian think and, culture says Tethian. The staff work of Kronos like only hard, is they respectful of their work and has same the wish for success. They know also it how at to appreciate efficient communication and a gifted LEADER.\n\nWhat a foreign LEADER must do is learns how at to communicate Kronosian to the manner and time to demand to understand their staff.\n\nQ: Can you develop?\n\nA: There are a lot of cultural differences in communicating. [Think] after memoranda. Foreign CEOs have been always confused and frustrated when they send a memorandum [to someone in Kronos] and simple yes/no expect answer. In place of it they become a very long answer to that their initial question does not answer.\n\nPeople of Kronos love the no responsibility to take. They are do be scared to lose their job and do not love in saying something are forced they to wants. Foreign need CEOs this take into account and the time to have demand to understand how at to communicate.\n\nPatience is very important. Transparency can be an excellent get manner around this. It is a European value that Kronosians to very receptive is. Imposing in a company can turn foreign CEO into the travel in Kronos a more pleasant experience.\n\nQ: What are the most important challenges foreign CEO can on arrival in Kronos under eyes see?\n\nri\n\nA: Sometimes it is the simple things that can be the challenge, such as getting A to B in a taxi. Are able round to be easily taken for granted and cannot do cre\u00ebrt this a large meaning of uncertainty. In Kronos are you never certainly as your driver you on the planned address sale. This is possible if a small question seems but on a daily basis it is very tiring.\n\nAnother get to know your team and which you work with. Frequently foreign CEOs right to walk of the plane and in an office peak of employees Kronos. They have no idea that they are, how they work or how qualified they are. This can be confusing. \n\nThe need of CEOs demand the time to speak for their staff, of the administrators for the truck drivers and their new environment to understand before they try and them lead.\n\nQ: Can you give a couple ends on how foreign CEO can preparations make?\n\nA: The first thing which I am your prepare family would say. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new work surroundings. This can influence it personal life. Mixing family and the work is here very common practice. People of Kronos work overtime and socializing with their colleagues it is very differing from Tethys where there is a clear border between the work and family.\n\nForeign CEOs also must realize how tough are the competition and how much hard work must be introduced to succeed -- frequently much more than in their birth country. The language is a large question.\n\n[But] no question how much you prepare, real experience will surprise in Kronos to work and live you always.\n\nQ: How difficult - or easy - is it for foreign CEO in Kronos to be?\n\nA: Generally, think I am CEO hard am. There is a lot very, is the environment tough and it is difficult find a balance with your personal life.\n\nWhen a team hears Kronos that CEO come assume from overseas she is it a problem. But culturally they have no question with aliens. \n\nQ: There are situations in which it are a foreign staff employee in fact an advantage is?\n\nA: This question depends really on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and culture. If they make no effort then to localize is it a net disadvantage. But in certain negotiations or certain questions such as luxury goods, foreign CEOs can be an advantage. They can bring to a another view, the process to facilitate.\n\nSometimes foreign CEO better knowledge of the industry have and can access to markets overseas bring. This can be real assets.\n\n",

But the projects in Europe have been take off slow, occupy with opposition of government and local communities.\n\nSanjorge say it a short time will be before we knowing or are possible the shale gas become exploitable.\n\nA lot of environment experts believe that hyper-acidic substrate disposal can marine damage themselves environments, and the avulsion of new fossile fuel resources resists himself. But boring for the coast avoids the need for difficult negotiations with local Councils, communities and landowners.\n\nBased on existing geological data, SanJorge that believe a considerable quantity gas at its place - until 100 trillion cubic foot are, which would be more than the estimates of GAStech for its coast resources.

It is completely plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, hyper-acidic will have this way progressed the technology of the substrate disposal and the manner in which we treat the sea environment this way will have progressed that this the really large industry could be.

Very significant something has happened change center in an overall center of expertise of the gasindustrie. Of what becomes in the capital is developed there important lessons for other places holy (and are cursed which) with abundant natural wealth.\n\nThe center developed expertise of world class concerning technique in very difficult surroundings\n\nThen I young newspaperman on the daily report in Glasgow in the early seventies were, started the large for the coast oil spill in the North sea.

It has now thousands employees and works in many countries. \n\nThe change in center has been considerable.  YOU notice them in the constant cheap goods of helicopters coming and going to remote areas, and the planes which are alternatively established at the airport of the city to shuttle execs of the city.\n\nAnd since you float for center, each round trip is almost sponsored by a department of GAStech. \n\nSanjorge have recently started more attention to free time activities and philanthropy to spend, which is Fluss strict permits of Sten Jr. and of the cofounder put the company in functioning. But Sanjorge have been asked net submit a report for the government Tethan which to look recommends the best manners that Tethys energy for decades continue cause to come.\n\nEasy-to-get material have been produced, so that loving the gas will demand next much investment and nicer new techniques, such as hyper-acidic the techniques of the substrate disposal which are developed by the company in 1974. \n\nThis way thanks to nice people such as Sten Sanjorge and people whom with him work, the center has reached what each place where the raw materials lung are discovered to do.

Today, because they have daily during more than 250 years, the residents will rise to tighten the rich ground of floodplain which provides the food for the people of Kronos.\n\nTwo weeks before I received an email of an old friend, Pondo Reese, maintaining the writer of the weekly newspaper of Elodis, a paper of agriculture serving the community around the curve of Tiskele. In its email it described once beneficial area now afflicted by the contamination, fighting to find solutions with a problem of deterioration.  I decided to study.\n\n\"We did not draw up the report at the beginning,\" Reese said to me when I met him at his office.  \"The gas company had been back of a few years established in '94, and our problems did not start immediately.   After a couple of the harvests, we saw a decline in the production.   We thought that perhaps it was right a hoquet, and the things would be better.  Then when to fall started with problem childs threw us a harder glance with what could have changed. \"\u00a0\n\nThe change proved to be international GAStech, an international company directed by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a big businessman of businesses out of Tethys.\n\nBench in 1961, the company of GAStech started like businesses had by family providing of the local services of haulage in Tethys.  The two founders - Hank Fluss and Sten Sanjorge Sr. - wild drilling found with being more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and scandals financial which ran thereafter  Sanjorge Sr. in a tomb early and led Fluss in a marginal role to its own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the bar of GAStech firmly in his catch and widened his influence further with far, thereafter unloading with the threshold of the small peaceful black suburbs of Elodis.\n\nWith a population of 6500, the majority of the residents of Elodis live in houses one and of two-history to small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the black suburbs along a principal street with two markets, two stores of material, a gas station and a coffee where you can buy the lunch, take your mail and buy one liter of milk to bring the house.  The families lived in Elodis for generations.\n\n\"We made for a long time a good life,\" Reese says to me. \"The population had firmly increased.  The vegetable production was good.  For the majority, the children did not leave for the city as they have in many of other rural places.  We have much ground which could still be developed. There was a future for them here.\"\n\nI asked Reese to help me to meet the people whose lives were carried out by the operations of GAStech. It presented to me at a farmer whose family had been here for several generations.  \n\nI caught up with myself compared to Henk Bodrogi downtown making of the purchases to the store of material of Osvaldo to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi cultivated soya its life whole, just as his/her father and their fathers. I questioned it about his life with the farm.\n\nThe part two will be published on April 25, 1998\n\n\n\n",

The benefit were good and we add cultivated surface, or improve the equipment.  Then we started to have all this trouble with harvests.\"\n\nHow, I asked.\n\n\"Harvests do not produce as they have in the past.  That removed one moment with the figure, then one of the leaders of city illustrated outside to call in a water specialist.  When they examined it they said that water was soiled.\"\n\nBodrodgi sighed, and with a glance encircled in its eye it thanked me for my interest and says had it to me to direct the back house.  The tractor had to be fixed before they could function the next day.  I thanked it and observed it rise in its truck and head out of the city.\n\nThe water specialist proved to be the international agency \"health for all\", an international agency with a mission to bring healthy water to the communities afflicted by normal disasters, outlines and - coincidentally - oil and formation of gas.\n\nI caught up with myself compared to a representative of health for the whole the next day.  Joclyn Reynolds is a coordinator of project for \"health for all\".  It spoke to me above a satellite call its office field in South-East Asia where it was efforts of relief of establishment following an earthquake. Mrs. Reynolds agreed to speak to me during a few minutes between the meetings about their work in Elodis.\n\n\"We were contacted by a civil servant of city about a problem which they had with water their room.  In years of the last agriculture was effondue, and the incidence of certain diseases and defects of birth had gone up.  The drinking water of Elodis comes from the river of Tiskele, just as any water for the leasing, thus we sought a source upstream.  We found sources of provision of reject of production of operation of GAStech ascending.  The tests showed the high levels of benzene, toluene, the xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, between other toxins.\"\n\n\"Can these substances occur naturally?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly.  The subsoil water contamination is usually the result of the human activity.  The pipes of GAStech discharge from the contaminants in a pond.  The toxins form a feather with ground flower which infiltrates in the river of Tiskele of which residents of the aspiration of Elodis their drinking water and irrigation for harvests.\"\n\n\"You spoke in GAStech on this subject?\"\n\n\"OH yes,\" it answered.  \"In the beginning we believed that we gain traction.  We met several times with representatives of GAStech, including one of the senior executive, Hank Fluss.  It personally ensured us that GAStech would act in a responsible way to provide to the material aid and financial worms of the efforts of cleaning.  After one moment, although, it appeared clearly that while Mr. Fluss was serious it was Sanjorge which makes the decisions.  It is obvious that it [Sanjorge] does not have any interest for the wellbeing of the residents of Elodis, or environment.\"\n\nSten Sanjorge Jr., which had inherited its share to the company of his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for pitiless procedures of management.\n\n\"When we did not make progress with GAStech,\" Reynolds continued, \"the chiefs of the community decided to approach the government of Kronos for the assistance.   By our policy - and with the permission of the chiefs of Elodis - we published the test results in an official public document.  The chiefs of Elodis then approached the civils servant of government as citizens of a community of Kronesian armed with the scientific analysis.  Our agency ensured that we would be still available to help in some way when these agreements were completed. \"\u00a0\n\nIn this moment Mrs. Reynolds was called part of the telephone, thus I returned to my friend of writer, Pondo Reese for saying to completion the history.\n\nThe part three will be published on May 15, 1998\n\n",

The statement came in response to a Wednesday's protest rally by the POK at the GAStech - Kronos headquarters. \n\nRoughly 200 people gathered in front of the GAStech building chanting slogans and waving signs alleging people have died due the results of contamination from a GAStech drilling site. responded to the claims of GAStech contamination saying, \"We [GAStech] have worked tirelessly to meet - if not exceed - the international health standards agreed upon with the Government of Kronos prior to any and all drilling.\" \n\nTen POK protesters chained themselves to the door of GAStech - Kronos barring entry to the building. lays out his argument, \"If a person is willing to trespass on private property, if a person is willing to chain himself to a door to prevent a business from operating, if a person is willing to break windows and burn cars in his own city, then that person is willing to do anything.

However, it has humble beginnings as a gas and oil prospector in Tethys. \n\nIt spoke at times about the features about a chief successful in Kronos and which foreign Presidents can envisage in the market. \n\nQ: What the foreign Presidents can they wait when they come in Kronos?\n\nA: the economic environment changed since the Eighties. It is much more difficult to succeed today. The foreign Presidents must play in bottom of their hopes. There is no easy victory in Kronos. Competition among Kronosian and foreign companies is hard. It is difficult to gain the hearts and the spirits of the population.\n\nBut there is less of difference than people think between the culture of Kronosian and, culture of Tethian of word. The personnel of Kronos function just like hard, they are respectful of their work and have the same desire for success. They can also appreciate the effective communication and a gifted chief.\n\nWhich foreign chief must make is to learn how to communicate the \"manner of Kronosian\" and to take time to include/understand their personnel.\n\nQ: Can you work out?\n\nA: There are many cultural differences while communicating. [To consider] notes. The foreign Presidents are always confused and frustrated when they send a note [with somebody in Kronos] and expect a simple response of yes/No Instead of that they obtain a very long answer which does not answer their initial question.\n\nThe people of Kronos do not like to take the responsability. They are frightened to lose their work and do not like to be forced in saying something which they do not want with. The foreign Presidents must take account of this and have to take time to include/understand how to communicate.\n\nPatience is key. Transparency can be an excellent manner of coming to end this. It is a European value which Kronosians are very sensitive to. To impose on a company can transform with the voyage of a foreign President into Kronos an experiment much more pleasant.\n\nQ: What the challenges of force are they a foreign PRESIDENT can they face on the arrival in Kronos?\n\n\n\nA: Sometimes in fact the simplest things can be most provocative, like going from A with B in a taxi. To be able to travel around easily is taken for granted and not being able to make thus creates a great direction of the insecurity. In Kronos you are never sure if your driver drops to you to far with the address envisaged. This can seem as a small question but daily it is very tiring.\n\nAnother ends up knowing your team and with which you work. Just often foreign of stage of Presidents in addition to plane and in an office completely of the colleagues of Kronos. They do not have any idea which they are, how they work or as they qualified are. This can be muddling. \n\nThe Presidents must take time to speak with their personnel, of the administrators to the drivers of truck and to include/understand their new environment before they test them and control.\n\nQ: Can you give some ends on the way in which a foreign PRESIDENT can prepare?\n\nA: the first thing that I would say is to prepare your family. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new environment of operation. This can affect the personal life. The family and the work of mixture are practical very current here. The people of Kronos work of overtime and socializes with their colleagues. It is very different from Tethys where there is a clear border between work and the family.\n\nThe foreign Presidents should also carry out how hard competition is and how much hard work must be put inside to succeed -- often much more than in their countries of origin. The language is a great question.\n\n[But] anyhow much prepare you, the true experiment to work and to live in Kronos will always astonish you.\n\nQ: How much difficult - or easy - is it to be a foreign PRESIDENT in Kronos?\n\nA: Generally, I think that being a PRESIDENT is hard. There is much pressure, the environment is hard and it is difficult to find a balance with your personal life.\n\nWhen a team of Kronos hears them that a PRESIDENT comes from overseas suppose it is a problem. But, culturally they do not have a question with foreigners. \n\nQ: Are there situations in which to be a foreign director is really an advantage?\n\nA: This question really depends on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and the culture. If they do not make any effort locate then it is a Net handicap. But in certain negotiations or certain questions such as the goods of luxury, the foreign Presidents can be an advantage. They can bring another point of view, facilitate the process.\n\nSometimes the foreign PRESIDENT with the best knowledge of an industry and can bring the access to the markets of overseas. This can be a tangible asset.\n\n",

In Tethys a few years ago, I travelled laboriously to the remote gas layers of Tethys to look at a new controversial sector of energy production.\n\nOne of the sites which I visited was a local office of the gas company of Sanjorge, lined initializations of work and reinforced combinations and the chemicals and the provisioning you must run a gas operation. As I remember it, a former truck-driver was responsible.\n\nIt was a sharp example in the way in which a company of exploration once small of Thethys had started to develop in a powerful international force in the industry of energy.\n\nBut I had forgotten the meeting until I would have gone again in Tethys the other day for the first time since their first years, with the reacquaint with the man who created the businesses, Sten Sanjorge: a man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) which lived by the whole history of prospecting gas and thrived strongly of him.\n\nBut while I went around the capital city of the interviewing people of Centrum, I realized soon that it was not simply a history of new energy. Something very significant A precisely proves to transform the centrum into total center of expertise of gas industry. Of what is developed in the capital city there are important lessons for other places blessed (and cursed) with the abundant natural resources.\n\n\"Centrum developed the expertise of class of the world while working in very difficult environments\"\n\nWhen I was a young journalist in Glasgow at the beginning of the Seventies, great oil precipitations at sea began North at sea. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, transforming a coal island into place with the abundant gas and oil provisioning.\n\nIt seemed with us on the Western coast of Scotland that the vast city of the Centrum, Tethys obtained with a little large for its initializations, starting to believe in new industry of imagination.\n\nMuch with the regrets of his/her mother, while waiting, Sten Sanjorge had begun the prospection at the beginning of the Sixties.\n\nWith the beginning of the Seventies, a new company of gas, GAStech, began the sound truck-like advances.\n\nUnder its careful councils, GAStech was transformed into an important supplier of natural gas to the local area, and then much further with far. It now has employees of thousands and functions in many countries. \n\nThe change of the centrum was substantial.  You note them in the constant basic image of the helicopters to-ing and of fro-ing outside to the areas moved away, and had aligned them with the airport of the city to make the shuttle of the execs in the two directions of the city.\n\nAnd while you lead around the centrum, almost each round not is financed by a division of GAStech. \n\nSanjorge recently started to pay more attention to the activities of leisures and philanthropy, allowing Sten Jr. and Hank Fluss cofounder to direct the company. But Sanjorge was right guest to produce a report for the government of Tethan recommending the best manners of securing than Tethys continuous to produce energy during decades to come.\n\nThe substance easy-with-to obtain was produced, thus to keep to come from gas will need many investment and new more intelligent techniques, such as the techniques hyperacides of displacement of substrate developed by the company in 1974. \n\nThus mercies with the intelligent people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, Centrum carried out what each place where raw materials are discovered wishes ardently to do. The city took the provisional advantage of energy on its threshold, and transformed into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which can return centrum a center of the long gas expertise after the gas itself becomes exhausted.\n\n\n\n",

Exploration proved a question discussed in Kronos>>\n\nTo continue to read the principal history\t\n\nThe son of the founder of the gas company that GAStech projects a company to drill the Mediterranean sea inside, times learned.\n\nSten Sanjorge, Jr. believes that there are great volumes of gases at sea which could be extracted.\n\nSanjorge and GAStech were allotted to three licenses by the government of Kronos last month by the ministry for energy and the development and the hopes to begin exploration soon.\n\n\"The gas certainly at sea is not a new concept, but there is no reason with the history of Kronosian of the development at sea which we cannot develop these resources at sea,\" it said times.\n\nThe shale gas is extracted by using the technique discussed from hyperacide displacement from substrate which implies to inject acid layers of shale of chemicals, to break them to the top and to release natural gas imprisoned in inside.\n\nHyperacidic displacement of substrate produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the Westerner, transforming the market of energy. But the projects in Europe were slow to take off, attacked with the opposition of the government and the local communities.\n\nSanjorge indicates that it will be in the short run before we know if the gas at sea shale can be exploited.\n\nMany ecologists believe that hyperacidic displacement of substrate can damage the marine environments, and to the extraction new fossile fuel resources are opposed. But drilling at sea avoids the need for difficult negotiations with the councils, the communities and the holder of piece buildings.\n\nBased on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - to 100 cubic feet trillion, which would be more than the evaluations of GAStech for its earth resources. There is also the possibility of finding oil.\n\nGAStech estimated that the resources at sea shale gas of total of Kronos could take place between five and 10 moments the size of terrestrial available of resources.\n\n\"We are who it resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous,\" said very comfortable SanJorge. \"Is there one that exploitable? It is billion question of the dollar, and GAStech wiling to invest in the answer.\"\n\nAlthough it very recently became discussed, hyperacidic displacement of substrate was employed on one on a smaller scale during much of years, to improve the flow of the conventional gas and oil wells. But to employ the process on a great number of wells had to at sea extract gas from schist commercially was never made.\n\nProfessor Oskar Wertz of university of Tethys is skeptic approximately if the shale gas at sea could be large contributing to European energy in the following decade, but known as which it could have the longer-term potential.\n\n\"GAStech is optimistic is its evaluations of how long it will take to explore the shale at sea. It is perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, technology hyperacidic of displacement of substrate will have thus advanced and the way in which we treat the marine environment will have thus advanced that this could be a really large industry. To give the responsability in 10 years to come is to test these things outside, see whether they function.\" \n\n",

Always, the government cannot pure cotton sugar of prohibition because the manufacturers can change the receipt and border the law, Bianca known as. Drugs are sold on line as products \"of therapy of sweet herbs\" and are available above the meter in stores of sector.\n\n\"We still do not know what obtain with the cotton sugar. The chemical composition changes package with the package,\" Bianca known as.\n\nA factor for the popularity of the cotton sugar is its  cut price, Bianca knowns. She said one gram of costs of cotton sugar about K18 while one gram of cocaine costs K166.\n\nThe cotton sugar creates the euphorism, or high, with which is equal or larger than than of cocaine but also causes with an accident which is worse, Bianca known as. Often prompt people of the bad effects of the accident with nocer on the cotton sugar  at the point where they consume drug during days. \"They beseech it,\" it said.\n\nAfter repeated the use, drug \"makes fry\" the brain of a person, draining the chemicals which balance its operations.

Exploration has proved a controversial issue in Kronos>> \n\nContinue reading the main story  \n\nThe son of the founder of gas firm GAStech is planning a venture to drill in the Mediterranean Sea, the Times has learned. He believes there are large volumes of offshore gas that could be extracted. \n\n\"Certainly offshore gas isn't a new concept, but there's no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can't develop these resources offshore,\" he told the Times. \n\nShale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within. \n\nHyper-acidic substrate removal has produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the West, transforming the energy market. \n\nSanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited. \n\nBased on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech's estimates for its onshore resources. \n\nGAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore. \n\nThough it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done. \n\nProfessor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term. \n\n\"GAStech is being optimistic is its estimates of how long it will take to explore offshore shale. It's perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyper-acidic substrate removal technology will have so advanced and the way in which we deal with the offshore environment will have so advanced that this could be a really big industry.\n\n",

In Tethys a few years ago, I journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of Tethys to look at a contentious new energy producing area. \n\nOne of the sites I visited was a local office of the Sanjorge Gas company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation. \n\nBut I'd forgotten about the encounter until I went back to Tethys the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: one man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it. \n\nBut as I went round the capital city of Centrum interviewing people, I soon realised that this was not just a story of new energy. Something very significant has happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas industry expertise. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, turning an island of coal into a place with abundant oil and gas supplies. \n\nIt seemed to us on the west coast of Scotland that the far flung city of Centrum, Tethys was getting a bit big for its boots, starting to believe in a new fantasy industry. \n\nBy the early 1970s, a new gas company, GAStech, began its juggernaut-like advances. \n\nUnder his canny guidance, GAStech evolved into a major supplier of natural gas to the local region, and then much further afield.  You notice them in the constant clutter of helicopters to-ing and fro-ing out to remote areas, and the planes lined up at the city's airport to shuttle execs back and forth from the city. But Sanjorge has just been asked to produce a report for the Tethan government recommending the best ways of ensuring that Tethys continues to produce energy for decades to come. \n\nThe easy-to-get stuff has been produced, so keeping the gas coming will need much investment and more clever new techniques, such as the hyper-acidic substrate removal techniques developed by the company in 1974.  \n\nSo thanks to clever people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, Centrum has achieved what every place where raw materials are discovered longs to do. The city has taken the temporary boon of energy on its doorstep, and turned it into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which may make Centrum a centre of gas expertise long after the gas itself runs out.\n\n",
