Fifteen members of the Protectors of Kronos (POK) activist organization were arrested by Kronos federal police yesterday following an dispute at the gates of the Tiskele Bend GAStech facility.  Swaying, the protesters sang well-known protest songs, including "This is Our Land", "Songs of the Farmer" and "The Weavers of our Homeland" 

When the federal police began arresting the POK protesters, they moved in an orderly fashion into the waiting police van, singing the entire time.

In a glitzy press conference late last year President Luis Araullo announced a historic set of tax incentives intended to bring foreign investment to Kronos under the guise creating jobs, providing cheap energy and building infrastructure.  Following the 86-14 vote last month the Minister of the Interior Tomas Sarto lauded the decision as "landmark" and "bettering the people".  The crafters of these revolutionary measures neglected to include a detailed plan about how this windfall would benefit everyday Kronosians.

PUBLISHED: Petrus Gerhard

NOTE: This article is the first in a series, reprinted with permission from the Homeland Illumination. 

This article is the first installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos. 

LOCATION: ELODIS, Kronos 

ELODIS, Kronos - Nestled in the bend of the Tiskele River, the sun rises over the farming town of Elodis,  chasing away the shadows cloaking nearby Mt.  Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos. 

Two weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around Tiskele Bend.  "The gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away. 

The change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out of Tethys. 

Established in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis. 

With a population of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a cafe. Here you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations. 

"We've made a good living for a long time," Reese tells me. 

I asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech's operations.   

I caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at the Osvaldo hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers.

This article is the last installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos.  I've asked  Elodis Weekly Journal editor Pondo Resses to tell me about the involvement of the government of Kronos in the deeply troubling account of a community's struggle for protection from those who should help them the most: their elected officials, against those who would poison their children and the country's food. 

"It took a long time for anyone to respond," Reese tells me of their struggle.  "Henk Bodrogi - the man you met - didn't give up.  He called every department that could possibly be associated with our problem:  interior, justice, foreign affairs, health.  Finally, a sympathetic person from the Ministry of Health answered the door, so that's where we started." 

Reese then describes months of meetings at which the government officials demanded documents proving their case:  health and crop yield statistics, the scientific test results from Wellness For All, and medical records.  We bring the documents they want, and then they want to confirm the results, or tell us to provide additional information or have closed door meetings.  We're currently in the process of negotiating a date for a hearing at the Ministry of Health to present our petition for assistance."

ABILA, Kronos - Yesterday, as they have each June 19th for the past three years supporters, of Protectors of Kronos rallied demanding much the same as they have in the past fourteen years:  an end to the corruption of the Kronos government officials and the cleanup of the toxic waste dump that has become the Tiskele River near Elodis. They handed out information on flyers printed and donated by local businesses about the lifestyle incongruities between today's elected officials and those of a few years ago. Demonstrators held posters of POK martyrs and chanted for social and economic parity, while black-clad members of the Abila Police formed faceless lines of shields, batons and side arms surrounding the crowds.  The rally had been publicized as a peaceful gathering of citizens to bring their concerns to the public consciousness.  The most dangerous item in their hands was a picture of a sweet-faced ten year dead old girl - Juliana Vann who died in 1998 of cancer caused by the benzene in her drinking water. 

Despite these heavy-handed efforts, as groups of people slipped through the barricades and moved through the streets to bring their message to the citizens of Kronos.   

How can these officials - hypothetically getting by on public salaries - afford the second homes, large boats and luxury automobiles they flaunt?

What I can tell you is that when I left Elian yesterday after meeting with him in the prison he was in excellent health and good spirits.  He was expecting to be released in the next few days and return to his work with the Protectors of Kronos, and was excited to continue the Protectors of Kronos mission to which he dedicated his life.  I can assure you that Elian's death will be investigated with all the resources at our disposal and those responsible will be brought to justice."

Karel, from Elodis, had been involved with the POK mission since he was young.  He was only a few years older than Juliana Vann, a friend who died in 1998 of toxin poisoning caused by illegal dumping from the Tethyn company GAStech.  

Calls to the President's office, the office of the Minister of Justice and the office of the Chief of Police were not immediately returned.

Demonstrating his trademark humor, Karel lifted his wrists and joked to his supporters as he is led away, "I guess I shouldn't have sent the President those cases of bottled water for his birthday."

Karel is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, an alliance of Kronos citizens from Elodis that has demanded the government clean up the contaminated water caused by gas drilling in their community. 

"We didn't ask for GAStech to come to our community," Karel said at a rally a few months ago.  "Neither Elodis nor the people of Kronos have received any benefit from the extraordinarily large amount of money that GAStech clears every year.  I ask:  Where is the money going?"

The police representative assured supporters who amassed outside the police station that Karel would be treated humanely, but declined to answer questions or allow visitors to see Karel.  F

Attorney Michale Kraft plans to meet with Karel Saturday morning.

In a touching ceremony Wednesday leaders of the activist group Protectors of Kronos paid tribute to their fallen leader, Elian Karel, who was murdered on 19 June 2009 while being illegally detained in a Kronos jail. 

"Today we gather to remember Elian Karel," Silvia Marek told the rapt assembly, many of whom held up white candles in Karel's honor. 

"Elian was born on an Elodis farm not 40 minutes from here, to Jeroen and Antaura Karel. By the time Elian was 17 many of his family members and friends were battling constant illness, including his neighbor 10-year old Juliana Vann." 

"Elian devoted his life to the people of Elodis as well as all citizens of Kronos, as did his father before him.  Elian knew his would be a difficult journey.  He had watched his father, Jeroen and the founder of the POK, Henk Bodrogi, walk the very path he would tread.  Elian knew the course would not be easy, and would leave little time for a personal life. 

"Elian's journey ended three years ago today." 

Over the course of the afternoon several other speakers paid tribute to not only Elian, but all who have been victims of the environmental catastrophe brought about by greed and corruption of public officials.  The police agitated many of the crowd, causing them to have to leave the assembly rather than be assailed with batons and pepper spray.

Two years ago yesterday Elian Karel died at age 28 in an Abila jail cell, purportedly of cardiac arrest.  Kraft had reached an agreement with the government that charges would be reduced and the Karel be released pending a trial, but Karel died two days before he was to go free. 

Questions linger, however, about the manner of Karel's death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police,  whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death, would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation.  After Karel's body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel's death stating that "we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries."

As reported at the time of Karel's death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel's body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police. 

Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karel's death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence. 

Yesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water.   

"Both of them died because of government lies and corruption," one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.  "Juliana died because Kronos allowed GAStech to poison our water, and Elian died because he tried to bring Juliana justice."

TITLE: WHO ARE the PROTESTERS

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

With the approaching third birthday of the death of of Elian Karel - former member of the Protectors of Kronos - the question is: who are the protesters? But not only which is they, which and why they protest? 

The Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis in accordance with the opinion of Wellness for All(WFA), an international group of safety of water. The POK was launched to give the attention to thequestions of clean water surrounding Elodis to the government of Kronos and of the world. The POK affirms that the site of international natural gas drilling of curve of GAStech Tiskele is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional fields surrounding Elodis. 

In 1998, WFA carried out test on the water of Elodis finding the levels high of benzene, arsenic of toluene and xylene, barium, chromium, lead and selenium. The test of a following report released by an attention and pressure on the international government and GAStech brought by WFA to the act. However, with reducing WFA in fragments due to the questions of placement, the requests of the POK were mainly ignored and reduced the value. 

Moreover in 1998, Juliana Vann, ten years old and previously healthy - died of a prolonged disease, which WFA claimed  was caused by contamination of water. The government of Kronos officially refuted the complaint quoting the fragmentation of the organization of WFA like obviousness of a dubious source not to make confidence. Without worrying, Juliana was well to the martyrdom of the POK and employed the image of Juliana on the literature of countryside since. 

The second principal martyr of POK is Elian Karel, which died in 2009 while imprisoned unspecified causes. The POK affirms it was stopped above trumped to the top of the expenses while the government of Kronos it question was a radical activist and violent one occupied in tax avoidance. Karel had been implied POK since its beginning since his/her father, Jeroen Karel, were an original member.  The death of Elan Karel in 2009 was marked for spontaneous examples of protest around Abila. The day of his death, June 19, saw protests, demonstrations, riots, and violence additional. 

The POK evolved of the peaceful protests and the demonstrations requiring the action of government to more violent activities including riots while they claim that the government made little with nothing by addressing the contamination, the intoxications, and the deaths suffered by their people. In date of 2011, the government of Kronos marked the POK as "threatens public".

The Protectors of Kronos (POK) continue to protest against the Kronos Government and GAStech International alleging pollution, water contamination and a lack of a government response. Lately the protests have turned violent escalating into rioting largely directed at the Tiskele Bend site.

Several instances of rioting in and around Elodis have been reported including the trashing of government buildings, rock throwing, and tire burnings.

ABILA, Kronos - With the third anniversary of Elian Karel's death approaching - former member of the Protectors of Kronos - the question is: who are the protesters?  

The Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis on the advice of the now defunct Wellness for All (WFA), an international water safety group. The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts that GAStech International's Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis. However, with the fragmenting of WFA due to funding issues, the POK's demands were largely ignored and downplayed. The Government of Kronos officially refuted the claim citing the fragmentation of the WFA organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted. Regardless, Juliana became the POK's first martyr and has used Juliana's image on campaign literature ever since.  

 The POK's second major martyr is Elian Karel, who died in 2009 while incarcerated of undetermined causes. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion. Karel had been involved with the POK since its inception given that his father, Jeroen Karel, was an original member.  

The POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people. As of 2011, the Government of Kronos has labeled the POK as a "public threat".

At this time it is unclear who the missing are and whether they are citizens of Kronos of Tethys, as many GAStech employees are Tethan. Speculation about the motives of the kidnappers has been rampant due to the recent news of the GAStech Initial Public Offering only a month ago.

While the official cause of the explosion is still under investigation, the problem may have come from a defect in the wellhead itself. GAStech's wellheads are ringed with collars that have set pins running through them.

ABILA, Kronos - The brazen day time assault on two peace officers by the POK is just another violent, terroristic act in a long string of such acts. 

Police spokesman Adrien Carman said of the attack, "Assaulting a police officer and destroying government property are serious crimes. 

Further exacerbating the situation, the two criminals defaced the officers' car by spray painting the POK logo.  

If they can attack two police officers in broad daylight, who is next?

TITLE: ELODIS, KRONOS:  AID of one divides two of the SOURCE UNEXPECTED

PUBLISHED: 1998/04/27

This article is the second installation of a series of three parts that deals with the problem every greater time an anguish of the community, the criminal fact of the government, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations in the country of Kronos.

I took for above with Henk Bodrogi in the city that made purchases in the warehouse of the hardware of Ferro to repair an broken tractor.  Bodrogi has cultivated the soybeans its whole life, like its father and his parents. I asked to him about its life in the farm.

"We have worked the Earth during long time - perhaps 200 years, perhaps a small piece more," Henk Bodrogi said to me as it chose on a package of per to us, looking for the right size.  "On the years we have added some hectares here and there.  To us it maintains occupied."

Occupied it is an underestimation, as I found when I punctured to farmer wiry to say to me more.

 "My wife obtains the raising of children and title to teach, then she will do a little something so that we eat for the lunch and we work next to me until supper.  When the children get school caretakers make their tasks, and we are all in the house most of the times by darkness."

"We do this most of the days," he we added, "with the exception of days of the adoration."

"All we know one another one here," Bodrogi we explained whereas we go away. "Most of the families they have lived here for the generations.  The first new people who came to the city were with that company of the gas that constructed the back part of some years."

I request Bodrogi if the business has been good. 

"We made quite good recently until time.  The benefits were good and added cultivated area, or increased the equipment.  Then we began to have all this hardship with the harvests."

How, I it requested.

"The harvests are not producing as they have in the past.  It awhile took the figure towards, outside then one of the calculated officials of the city towards outside calling in a specialist of the water.  They proved when it they said that the water was contaminated."

Bodrodgi sighed, and with a glance surrounded in its eye thanked for he me by my interest and this it had to me to direct it the back home.I th anked for it I watched and to raise it in its car and head outside city.

The specialist of the water turned out to be the international agency "health for all", an international agency with a mission to bring the healthy water to the communities caused sorrow by natural disasters, sketch and - coincidently - oil and development of the gas.

I took for above with a representative of the health for all the following day.  Joclyn Reynolds is coordinating of the project for the "health for all".  She spoke to me on a call based on the satellites of her office of the field in Asia South-Eastern where she was efforts of the relevation of the creation which followed an earthquake. Ms Reynolds decided to speak me by some minutes between the meetings on its work in Elodis.

"A civil employee of the city on a problem we made contact with enemy whereupon they had with its local water.  In years of last agriculture one had collapsed, and the incidence of certain diseases and defects of birth had risen.  The potable water of Elodis comes from the river of Tiskele, like all the water to cultivate, so we looked for a source against the current.  We above find sources of the useless disposition of the production in <km> of the operation of GAStech by waters.  The tests demonstrated to stops levels of the benzene, the tolueno, arsenic of xylene, the lead and the selenium, among other toxins. "

"These substances Can happen naturally" I asked to him.

"Not in these amounts, and not this one suddenly.  The contamination of the underground water is generally the result of the human activity.  The pipes of GAStech are sending the polluting agents in a pool.  The toxins are forming plume subsurface that leaks in the river of Tiskele of which the residents of the drainage of Elodis its potable water and irrigation for the harvests."

"You spoke with GAStech on this?"

"Oh yes," she answered.  "We thought at the outset that we gained the traction.  We solved several times with the representatives of GAStech, including one of "the senior" executives, Fluss hank.  It assured personally to us that GAStech would act responsible to provide material and financial aid towards efforts of the cleaning.  After a time, although, got to be clear that whereas Mr. Fluss was serious it was Sanjorge that makes the decisions.  It is evident that it [Sanjorge] does not have any interest in the well-being of the residents of Elodis, or the atmosphere."

Sten Sanjorge, the Jr, who had inherited his part in the company of his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for the practices of business of cutthroat.

"When we did not make progress with GAStech," Reynolds continued, "the leaders of the community decided to approach the government of Kronos for the aid.   By our policy - and with the permission of the leaders of Elodis - we published the test results in an official public document.  The leaders of then Elodis approached the officials of the government like citizens of a community of Kronesian armed with the scientific analysis.  To our he assured them agency that we would be again available to help anyway when those agreements were concluded. "

To this point the Reynolds far from the telephone called ms, so I returned to my friend of the editor, Pondo Reese to tell to end history.

Part three will be published the 15 of May of 1998

The operations of the pipe of GAStech are based on Kronos of the east, and is near relation with the government of Kronosian. This one is the heart of the business of the pipe of Kronos, where the gas of the gas fields of the east settles tubes to the west towards the rest of Kronos, Tethys and Europe.

GAStech does more than as soon as the gas of the pump. It has created cities and cities to maintain his operations, that it handles and it works almost single-giving.

The head of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, that photo watches fixedly towards outside calendars and of marks throughout in the country, recognizes "state inside the accusations of a state", but she discusses that the necessities of the company simply to take care of his workers and of the communities around them.

By all means, to populate the good reasons with the necessity to come and to work in the hostile remote regions of Kronosian. They provide medical aid, the hospitality, and the food. The empire of GAStech has 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its farms of the company, it works gyms, and it offers subsidized holidays in the resources of the Black Sea for the dominant employees. For the executives, it works a state extreme extra, a medical center and of the marble-aligned therapy.

In addition to all these allowances, there is also the station of GAStech TV, that does not even pretend to be impartial. It is there serving the will as the company.

It was an alive example of how a once small reconnaissance company of Thethys had begun to grow in a powerful international force in the industry of the energy.

But it had forgotten to me on the encounter until I again went to Tethys the other day for the first time from its years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: a man (one of the richest individuals of Tethys) who has lived with the whole history of the gas that prospected and has prospered powerfully of him.

But like I was around the capital city of the people who entrevistaba with of the center, soon I made that this was not right a history of the new energy. Something very significant has happened to give return to the center in a global center of the masters of the industry of the gas. Of what it is developed in the capital city are important lessons for other places blessed (and it cursed) with the abundant natural resources.

The "center developed masters of the class of the world in directing in the very difficult environs"

When it was newspaperman young in the daily file in Glasgow at the beginning of years 70, the great attacks coast outside of the oil began in the North Sea. Then it looked like a pretty impossible dream, giving returned to an island of the coal in a place with the abundant sources of the oil and gas.

It was looked like us in the coast of the west of Scotland that the city far thrown of the center, Tethys was able to great small piece for its shippers, beginning to believe in a new industry of the fantasy.

Much to the grief of its mother, meanwhile, Sten Sanjorge had begun the prospection in early years 60.

By early years 70, a new company of the gas, GAStech, began his monster-like advances.

Under its direction canny, GAStech was developed in an important jet of the natural gas to the local region, and later it foments much to the distant spot. Now it has employees of the thousands and it works in numerous countries. 

The change in center has been substantial.  You notice in the constant uproar of helicopters to-Ing. and fro-Ing. towards it go to the moved away areas, and the planes aligned in the airport of the city to backwards go and execs forwards and of the city.

And as you lead around the center, almost each traffic circle is sponsored by a division of GAStech. 

Sanjorge has recently begun to pay more attention to the pastimes and philanthropy, allowing that its Fluss hank of the Jr and the Co-founder of Sten of the son directs the company. But Sanjorge finishes requesting itself to produce a report for the government of Tethan that recommends the best ways to make sure that Tethys continues producing the energy per decades to come.

The matter of easy-to-obtaining has taken place, so to keep to come from the gas it will need much investment and new readier techniques, such as the hyperacid techniques of the retirement of the substratum developed by the company in 1974. 

It so thanks for ready people as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, center has reached what wishes each place in where the raw materials are discovered to do. The city has taken the temporary favor from the energy in its threshold, and it has given to return in the specialized knowledge and the intellectual characteristic him that can make center a center of masters of the long gas after the gas itself works towards outside.

"An increase in mental problems of health, including the hallucinations and the paranoia, accompanied by violent behavior and an increase marked in tariffs of the suicide are only some of the indicators of the use of this drug of designer."

"In the first place we have alerted to harbor civil employees to be in the observation post for the suspicious shipments of insecticides and detergent, both similars in aspect to MDMC."

Supplied of fuel by a displeasure every greater time with the severe government of Kronosian, he began to lead the POK in a action-based organization, instead of whom he hoped his government to do aright of the things.

Reviving the live coals of the Julian Vann campaign, the girl of 10 years who died of the diseases attributed to the industrial useless currents of the government-favored corporation of GASTech in 1998, Karel was arrested and sent in the jail that follows an POK-initiated human barricade in front of the headquarters of GAStech in May. Karel died Wednesday whereas it served time in jail. The government of Kronos rejects the commentary on the circumstances of his death.

Something charismatic, Karel could inspire to a crowd and draw the attention to the social and political agenda of POK.   Once, after the Jr of the CEO Sten Sanjorge de GAStech compared the POK to a group of the terrorist in an interview of the press, Karel quipped, "Sanjorge is a leader shining of GAStech.

TITLE: The pioneer of the gas of the slate plans first wells outside coast of the world in the Mediterranean Sea 

PUBLISHED: 1984/05/05

<<Deleted image: Demonstrator whom it perforates of Anti-offshore.  The exploration has proven an controversial edition in Kronos>>

To continue reading main history	

The son of the founder of the company of the gas that GAStech is planning a company to perforate inside the Mediterranean Sea, the times has learned.

Sten Sanjorge, Jr thinks that there are the great volumes of gas coast outside that could be extracted.

Sanjorge and GAStech were granted to three licenses by the government of Kronos the month last through the ministry of the energy and the development and hopes to begin the exploration soon.

"The gas certainly coast outside is not a new concept, but there is no reason with the history of Kronosian of the development coast outside that we cannot develop to these resources coast outside," he said the times.

The gas of the slate is extracted using the controversial technique of the hyperacid retirement of the substratum that implies injecting of acid layers of the slate of chemical agents, to break them for above and sending the catched natural gas inside.

The hyperacid retirement of the substratum has produced the extensive amounts of gas and oil in the one of the west, having transformed the market of the energy. But the projects in Europe have been slow to remove, surrounded with the opposition of the government and local communities.

Many ecologists think that the hyperacid retirement of the substratum can damage marine atmospheres, and oppose the extraction of the new resources of the fossil fuel. But perforating coast outside avoids the necessity of the difficult negotiations with the local advice, communities and landholders.

In agreement with existing geologic data, SanJorge thinks that a considerable amount of gas is in the place - up to 100 cubical feet trillón, that would be more than the estimations of GAStech for their terrestrial resources. There is also the possibility of finding the oil.

GAStech has considered that the resources coast outside of the gas of the slate of the total of Kronos could be between five and 10 times the terrestrial size of the available one of the resources.

"We are that the resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous," said very comfortable SanJorge.  "Is anyone of that one explotable? That one is billion questions of the dollar, and GAStech wiling to invest in the answer."

Although it has gotten to be only recently controversial, the hyperacid retirement of the substratum has been used in one more a smaller scale by many years, to improve the gas and conventional well flow of the oil. But to use the process in a great amount of needed wells to extract the gas coast outside of the slate never has been made commercially.

Professor Oskar Wertz of the university of Tethys is skeptical around if the gas coast outside of the slate could be a great contribuidor to the European energy in the next decade, but says that he could have potential in the one of more long term.

"GAStech is being optimistic is its estimations of how long will take to explore the slate outside coast. He is perfectly reasonable that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyperacid technology of the retirement of the substratum will have so advanced and the way of which we took care outside of the ambient coast we will have so advanced that this could be a really great industry. The task in the 10 next years is to try these things towards outside, considers if they work."

Protectors of the spokesman of Kronos indicated "in Kronos the inheritances of the environmental negligence and the deficiency of the preoccupation by means of people that little uniform hope of the change more. Therefore, the rage simmering per years, but now has boiled the excess"

"To populate the protest because they are suffering, because they do not have medical aid. We demand the government we resigned," Terek Kamal, a driver of the car, said the times.

The malaise began in previous Abila in the week, with protests on the dismissal of several employees of Kronosian of international giant the GAStech energy.  GAStech has its roots in Tethys, although many directors live in Kronos.

This one appears to be a case of the frustration simmering that it boils above.

The administration is highly of support of GAStech and its rent of tax to the boxes of the government - it looks like yet not to pay attention of any edition pressing but to its own packages on-means of the payment.

The environmental situation is desperate. The hundreds of rural citizens are suffering the important diseases caused apparently by the exhibition to the useless currents of GAStech, although this one has not been verified civil employee nor recognizes by the company or the government. 

That is what sparked the initial protests in Abila - but empathy with its cause brought demonstrators towards outside in cities through Kronos.  Initially pacific, these protest are more and more violent now, and take to the police and to the citizens in sometimes fatal shooting.

TITLE: Penetration of an expert: prospering like foreign CEO in Kronos 

PUBLISHED: 2014/03/26
17 of January of 1995


The Fluss hank is CEO of GAStech, main industry of Krono by more than 15 years, after its discovery of its immense gas fields near the city of Elodis.

Fluss, has worked with dozens of foreign CEOs on the years. Nevertheless, it has humble principles like prospector of the oil and the gas in Tethys. 

He spoke to the times on the characteristics of a leader guessed right in Kronos and what foreign CEOs can hope in the market. 

Q:  What can foreign CEOs wait for when it comes to Kronos?

A: The economic atmosphere has changed from years 80. He is much more hard to be successful today. Foreign necessity of CEOs to play under its expectations. There are no easy triumphs in Kronos. The foreign competition between Kronosian and companies are resistant. It is difficult to gain the hearts and the minds of the population.

But there is less difference than people think between the culture of Kronosian and, culture of Tethian of the opinion. The personnel of Kronos works hardly like hardly, she is respectful of her work and has he himself desire for the success. Also they know to appreciate to the efficient communication and a talented leader.

What foreign leader needs to do it is to learn how to communicate the "way of Kronosian" and to take time to understand its personnel.

Q:  Can you elaborate?

A: There are many cultural differences in communicating. [Considerar] the notes. Foreign CEOs always confused and is frustrated when somebody in Kronos sends a note [] and counts on a simple answer of yes/no. In place they obtain a very long answer that it does not answer its initial question.

The people of Kronos do not have taste to take responsibility. They scare it to lose his works and she does not have taste of being forced in saying something that it does not wish a. Foreign necessity of CEOs to take this in consideration and to need to take the time to understand how to communicate.

The patience is key. The transparency can be an excellent way to obtain around this. It is an European value that Kronosians is very responsivo a. The imposition of him in a company can make the trip of a foreign CEO in Kronos a much more pleasant experience.

Q:  Which is the challenges of the pipe a foreign CEO can do in front on arrival in Kronos?

A: It is sometimes the simplest things that they can be desafiadoras, like obtaining of A to B in a taxi. The power to obtain around is taken easily for granted and not being able to do so it creates a great sense of the insecurity. In Kronos you never are safe if his conductor falls to him dull in the feasible line. This can look like as a small edition but on a daily base is very annoying.

Another one is becoming familiar with its equipment and with whom you are working. The often foreign right of the passage of CEOs of the plane and in an office completely of the fellow workers of Kronos. They do not have any idea that is, how they work or how they are described are. This can be confused. 

Q:  Can you give some extremities in how a foreign CEO can prepare yourself?

A: The first thing that would say is to prepare its family. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new surroundings of work. This can affect personal life. The family and the work who mix themselves are practical very common here. The people of Kronos work in extra hours and socialize with her colleagues. It is very different from Tethys where there is a clear limit between the work and the family.

Foreign CEOs must also make how he is resistant is the competition and how much hard work must be put inside to be successful -- often much more that in its countries of origin. The language is a great edition.

[But] does not concern you at the most is prepared, the true experience of the work and to live in Kronos it will always surprise to him.

Q:  How difficult - or easy - is to being a foreign CEO in Kronos?

A: Generally, I think that being a CEO he is hard. There are many of pressure, the atmosphere is resistant and is difficult to find a balance with its personal life.

When an equipment of hears them to Kronos that a CEO is coming from overseas assumes is a problem. But, cultural they do not have an edition with the foreigners. 

Q:  Hay the situations in which the foreign executive being is really an advantage?

A: This question really depends on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and the culture. If they do not deliver any attack then to locate he is a net one harms. But in certain negotiations or certain editions such as luxury merchandize, foreign CEOs can be an advantage. They can bring another point of view, facilitate the process.

The foreign CEO has better knowledge of an industry and can sometimes bring the access to the overseas markets. This can be true assets.

The number of fields with cost by barrel on K30 has doubled in the 12 last months.

The increasing prices were mentioned the week last through GAStech, that is considering the future investments in Norway and North America, rather that the fields of Kronos.

With increasing prices, one hopes that the payments of the tax from the production to the Property of Kronos lower of K3.5bn during budgetary exercise 2011-12 to K2bn in the present year.


After the fast declination in the production of the oil and the gas of the fields of Kronos these last years, the index of the fall was slowed down down during 2012 - by the barrels of 8% to of .83m of oil per day, or its equivalent ones of the gas.

TITLE: Hospitals of Abila that see the affluence of the designer drug users


PUBLISHED: 2013/02/09
The department of the emergency in the general hospital of Abila in Kronos has been sunk in the month last through the people who underwent medical complications of designer drugs such as "caramel of cotton" and synthetic marijuana, civil employee of the hospital this.

"We have had at least two cases dozen in the last month," said Alicia Bianca, in charge of the nurse of the department. "They crush to Us literally."

Bianca said that it never has seen east level of the activity related to the overdoses of the drug in the seven years that it has handled the department of the emergency and in the 20 years she has been nurse.

The authorities in the "caramel of cotton this Abila" could have been a factor in the death of the Potter de Ralf of 54 years, that contusionaron and the naked body was found the 4 of February throughout a way of the deadlock. The investigators are waiting information of the toxicología to determine the cause of their death. Citywide, several deaths have been attributed to the "caramel of cotton" according to the national center of the poison of Kronos.

The patients are coming to the general of Abila through the greater region of the city, and include to adults and the socioeconomic youths, man and female, and all bottoms, Bianca this.

Sgt Antonio Arresta of the body of firemen of Abila, first-responder to the medical calls of the emergency in the city, said that its department also has considered a point in the number of the people who needed the treatment for the complications designer drugs. "We went of calls zero to a handful of calls" in the last month," he said.

Bianca and Arresta these their efforts to treat people become more difficult because they often do not know any thing on the designer drugs that were taken.

"You do not know what you are obtaining when obtain you it," to Bianca this. "We have done that the patients come inside and who act outside control, that is very violent. They say to us that there are been making the caramel of cotton or the synthetic marijuana."

Bianca this is few clinical data there on the effects of the cotton caramel, because he is toxicant that emerges. "There are studies no controlled in toxicología," she said. The national center of the poison gathers anecdotal information on overdose of hospitals and other suppliers like part of efforts to offer advice on how treating patients.

The designer drugs are composed chemical synthesized to resemble itself the active often illegal drug ingredient. The caramel of mímico cotton khat of the drug, a stimulant. The manufacturers frequently change to the chemical composition and its name of the drug of designer to the passage in front of authorities, Biance of the stay a saying. "It is another way to sell it," she said.

The caramel of cotton of the term, for example, is a nickname of the drug and it does not have anything to do with convite of the carnival. The drug has been sold under the name of the "spice soña" one week and under the name of the "flower of tulipán" the following one. 

The government of Kronos has put three of chemical agents of general use in the creation of the caramel of cotton in his controlled list of the substance, criminalizing his use and possession. However, the government cannot caramel of absolute cotton of the interdiction because the manufacturers can alter the prescription and border the law, Bianca this. The drugs are sold in line as products of the "herbaria therapy" and are available on the accountant in warehouses of the area.

"Still we do not know what you are obtaining with the cotton caramel. The chemical composition varies of the package to the package," Bianca this.

A factor for the reputation of the cotton caramel is his low cost, Bianca this. She said a gram of costs of the cotton caramel on K18 whereas a gram of cocaine costs K166.

The cotton caramel creates euphoria, or an overflow, to which it is equal or greater than than of the cocaine but also cause to collapse that is worse, Bianca this. The people often soon of badly the effects of the collapse to go of borrachera in the cotton caramel to the point where they consume the drug per days. They yearn for "It," she said.

After he is repeated the use, "the cold" drug the brain of a person, draining the chemical agents that balance their operations.

A measure to increase taxes on foreign oil and gas development proposed by Minister of Health Cesare Nespola was defeated by a wide margin last week in the General Assembly.
This defeat is a harsh blow to the Protectors of Kronos, an Elodis group that was counting on this funding to provide healthcare and environment cleanup of their drinking and irrigation water.
"We have a meeting planned with the Minister," Protectors of Kronos leader Henk Bodrogi told the Homeland Illumination.  "Don't count us out yet.  We plan to improve the measure and Minister Nespola will reintroduce it later this year."
Bodrogi is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, a grassroots environmental group with a mission to reverse the pollution caused by gas drilling in his hometown.

Two years ago yesterday Elian Karel died at age 28 in an Abila jail cell, purportedly of cardiac arrest.  He had been arrested three months prior for spurious charges of tax evasion and left to linger in a jail cell without further legal action.  His attorney, Michale Kraft made several appearances in court demanding that the government outline their specific charges, and release Karel.  Kraft had reached an agreement with the government that charges would be reduced and the Karel be released pending a trial, but Karel died two days before he was to go free.
Questions linger, however, about the manner of Karel’s death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police –whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death – would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation.
This “thorough investigation” lasted all of two weeks, including the time it took the Abila City Coroner to lose the original autopsy files.  After Karel’s body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel’s death stating that “we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries.”
As reported at the time of Karel’s death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel’s body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police.  These confidential sources have since moved from the area and have been unavailable for contact.
Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karel’s death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence.
Yesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water.  
“Both of them died because of government lies and corruption,” one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.  “Juliana died because Kronos allowed GAStech to poison our water, and Elian died because he tried to bring Juliana justice.  When will it end?”
Another, larger crowd had gathered the day before in a nearby city park to bring public awareness about these same issues.  Amid the speeches and music, I heard the same message from the year before:  “Remember Juliana! Remember Elian!”

In a touching ceremony Wednesday leaders of the activist group Protectors of Kronos paid tribute to their fallen leader, Elian Karel, who was murdered on 19 June 2009 while being illegally detained in a Kronos jail.
"Today we gather to remember Elian Karel," Silvia Marek told the rapt assembly, many of whom held up white candles in Karel's honor.
"Elian was born on an Elodis farm not 40 minutes from here, to Jeroen and Antaura Karel.  He grew up with the specter of death all around him.   By the time Elian was 17 many of his family members and friends were battling constant illness, including his neighbor 10-year old Juliana Vann."
Marek paused a moment to allow the cries of "Remember Juliana!" to fade.
"Elian devoted his life to the people of Elodis as well as all citizens of Kronos, as did his father before him.  Elian knew his would be a difficult journey.  He had watched his father, Jeroen and the founder of the POK, Henk Bodrogi walk the very path he would tread.  Elian knew the course would not be easy, and would leave little time for a personal life.  Yet he chose to take those steps despite the challenges he knew he would face."
"Elian's journey ended three years ago today.  But his dream did not die with him.  And it is that vision of a healthy and prosperous future for all we are here today to honor."
Over the course of the afternoon several other speakers paid tribute to not only Elian, but all who have been victims of the environmental catastrophe brought about by greed and corruption of public officials. 
The gathering was marred only by the aggravating presence of Abila police in riot gear.  The police agitated many of the crowd, causing them to have to leave the assembly rather than be assailed with batons and pepper spray.

Yesterday, as they have each June 19th for the past three years supporters of Protectors of Kronos rallied demanding much the same as they have in the past fourteen years:  an end to the corruption of the Kronos government officials and the cleanup of the toxic waste dump that has become the Tiskele River near Elodis. 
The rally which took place at several venues across the city, including in front of President Kapelou's publically-owned home and in front of the Abila capital building.  The citizens gathered hoping their voices would be heard by their elected officials. They handed out information on flyers printed and donated by local businesses about the lifestyle incongruities between today's elected officials and those of a few years ago. Demonstrators held posters of POK martyrs and chanted for social and economic parity, while black-clad members of the Abila Police formed faceless lines of shields, batons and side arms surrounding the crowds.
On everyone's mind was the question:  Who brings a gun to a peaceful sit in?  The rally had been publicized as a peaceful gathering of citizens to bring their concerns to the public consciousness.  The most dangerous item in their hands was a picture of a sweet-faced ten year dead old girl - Juliana Vann who died in 1998 of cancer caused by the benzene in her drinking water.  
Why did the Kronos government feel the need to send a police brute squad?
Despite these heavy-handed efforts, as groups of people slipped through the barricades and moved through the streets to bring their message to the citizens of Kronos.  Flyers bringing messages of truth and justice were left on park benches, in coffee houses and on light poles.  
How can these officials - hypothetically getting by on public salaries - afford the second homes, large boats and luxury automobiles they flaunt?

Earlier this year a series Homeland Illumination published a series of articles about groundwater contamination in Elodis, and how the locals are demanding a government response for what is essentially Government of Kronos-sponsored pollution and poisoning of citizens.  This article is an update.
ELODIS, Kronos - Ten-year old Juliana Vann died yesterday afternoon, surrounded by her family and friends.  The cause of death was leukemia due to benzene poisoning.
Juliana had been sick for over a year.  Initially her family didn't realize that benzene poisoning was the cause of Juliana's problems.  After visits to many hospitals, a doctor associated with the international assistance organization Wellness For All recommended Juliana be tests for benzene poisoning.  At that point, however, the little girl's system was too damaged to recover.
The residents of Elodis have been pleading with the government of Kronos to take action against the pollution caused by the GAStech gas drilling operation just 20 km upstream from Elodis.
Juliana's death is but one of several deaths this rural township has suffered because of toxic waste being dumped into the Tiskele River by Tethys corporation GAStech.
Private funeral services will be held on August 21 in the family home.

In another unconscionable move against the citizens of Kronos, earlier today police arrested POK leader Elian Karel on spurious tax evasion charges.  He was led - manacled – from a meeting of the Protectors of Kronos in Elodis, a rural township outside Abila.
Demonstrating his trademark humor, Karel lifted his wrists and joked to his supporters as he is led away, “I guess I shouldn’t have sent the President those cases of bottled water for his birthday.”
Karel is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, an alliance of Kronos citizens from Elodis that has demanded the government clean up the contaminated water caused by gas drilling in their community.
“We didn’t ask for GAStech to come to our community,” Karel spoke at a rally a few months ago.  “We didn’t’ ask for our water to become undrinkable, for our children to become sick.  Neither Elodis nor the people of Kronos have received any benefit from the extraordinarily large amount of money that GAStech clears every year.  I ask:  Where is the money going?”
The police representative assured supporters who massed outside the police station that Karel would be treated humanely, but declined to answer questions or allow visitors to see Karel.
“He’s a determined man,” Karel’s attorney Michale Kraft told me over the phone. “He’ll fight these false charges and be out in a few days.  He’ll probably complain about the jail food at the next POK rally.” 
Kraft plans to meet with Karel Saturday morning.
Calls to the President and Minister of Justice offices were not immediately returned.

Thousands of people lined the roads on Thursday in a display of antigovernment solidarity.

Among the demonstrators was Mestache Vardshvna, 23, from the west coast of Kronos.   "We're trying to get the attention of our government," he told the Homeland Illumination.  "This is important, so I took time off from work to be a part of this important event."

He was one of many who wielded their power of free speech to voice their concern with the current lack of government transparency with public monies.

 "They need to be aware that we know what they're doing," added Vardshvna.  "You can't just steal our money and think you can get away with it."

Posters with colorful images of Elian Karel and Juliana Vann were reminders of the heavy toll already paid by leaders and innocents.  Karel was the prior leader of the Protectors of Kronos before his premature death in 2009.  His death, thought to be a murder by many, prompted annul rallies to bring the message of the Protectors of Kronos to the public.  Juliana Vann died in 1998 of cancer caused by environmental toxins in her drinking water.  She had just turned ten years old.

AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard
PUBLISHED: 15 May 1998




This article is the last installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos.
Pondo Reese, editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, stands at his window, looking out toward the sun setting on the Tiskele River.  I've asked him to tell me about the involvement of the government of Kronos in the deeply troubling account of a community's struggle for protection from those who should help them the most: their elected officials, against those who would poison their children and the country's food.
"It took a long time for anyone to respond," Reese tells me of their struggle.  "Henk Bodrogi - the man you met - didn't give up.  He called every department that could possibly be associated with our problem:  interior, justice, foreign affairs, health.    Henk and a few other residents made several trips to Abila trying to get someone to listen.  Finally, a sympathetic person from the Ministry of Health answered the door, so that's where we started."
Reese then describes months of meetings at which the government officials demanded documents proving their case:  health and crop yield statistics, the scientific test results from Wellness For All, and medical records.
"It's been frustrating.  We bring the documents they want, and then they want to confirm the results, or tell us to provide additional information or have closed door meetings.  We're currently in the process of negotiating a date for a hearing at the Ministry of Health to present our petition for assistance."
Has it been worth it?
"You tell me," Reese nods out his window.  I look over his shoulder to see a group of children kicking a soccer ball in the dust.
"What choice do we have?"

Representatives from the social activist group Protectors of Kronos (POK) met earlier this week with Cesare Nespola, Minister of Health to discuss resolutions to the water contamination that has plagued Elodis since the late 1990s.
"This was a productive meeting," POK leader Henk Bodrogi told the Homeland Illumination.  "I am greatly heartened by the interest the government is showing in suffering of the people of Elodis.  He seemed to be very responsive to our request to establish improved health care in Elodis, and reverse the contamination responsible for so many of our illnesses."
The POK formed in 1997 from a grassroots action group in response to the pollution of the Elodis water supply and the resultant sickness and deaths of local residents over the subsequent several years.

AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard
PUBLISHED: 12 March 2009

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos

In another unconscionable move against the citizens of Kronos, earlier today police arrested POK leader Elian Karel on spurious tax evasion charges.  He was led - manacled - from a meeting of the Protectors of Kronos in Elodis, a rural township west of Abila.
Demonstrating his trademark humor, Karel lifted his wrists and joked to his supporters as he is led away, "I guess I shouldn't have sent the President those cases of bottled water for his birthday."
Karel is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, an alliance of Kronos citizens from Elodis that has demanded the government clean up the contaminated water caused by gas drilling in their community.
"We didn't ask for GAStech to come to our community," Karel spoke at a rally a few months ago.  "We didn't ask for our water to become undrinkable, for our children to become sick.  Neither Elodis nor the people of Kronos have received any benefit from the extraordinarily large amount of money that GAStech clears every year.  I ask:  Where is the money going?"
The police representative assured supporters who massed outside the police station that Karel would be treated humanely, but declined to answer questions or allow visitors to see Karel.
"He's a determined man," Karel's attorney Michale Kraft told me over the phone. "He'll fight these false charges and be out in a few days.  He'll probably complain about the jail food at the next POK rally." 
Kraft plans to meet with Karel Saturday morning.
Calls to the President and Minister of Justice offices were not immediately returned.

TITLE: MINISTER OF HEALTH TO PROPOSE SOLUTION TO TOWN POISONING
AUTHOR: Maha Salo
PUBLISHED: 7 July 1999

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos

Prime Minister of Health Cesare Nespola announced he would sponsor a bill to increase taxes on foreign energy development in Kronos intended to fund environmental cleanup and improved healthcare for rural towns.  Following a series of meetings with members of the activist group Protectors of Kronos (POK) the announcement was made last week.

"Our path forward is clear," POK co-leader Carmine Osvaldo told the Homeland Illumination.  "We fight for clean water, good health and now we will have the funds to make this happen.  Thanks to Minister Nespola no more children will have to die."

Osvaldo refers to Juliana Vann, a 10-year old girl who died last year from leukemia due to with benzene poisoning from gas drilling operations upstream from her home.

The POK formed in 1997 in response to the pollution of the Elodis water supply and the resultant sickness and subsequent deaths of local residents.

TITLE: ELODIS, KRONOS:  HELP FROM AN UNEXPECTED SOURCE Part Two
AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard
PUBLISHED: 25 April 1998

This article is the second installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos.
I caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at Ferro Hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm.
 "We've worked the land for a long time - maybe 200 years, maybe a bit more," Henk Bodrogi told me as he picked over a container of bolts, searching for the right size.  "Over the years we've added a few hectares here and there.  It keeps us busy."
Busy is an understatement, as I found when I prodded the wiry farmer to tell me more.
"I usually head to the fields before sun up," Mr. Henk Bodrogi tells me. "My wife gets the kids up and heading to school, then she'll make a little something for us to eat for lunch and work alongside me until dinner.  When the children get home from school they do their chores, and we're all back at the house most times by dark."
"We do this most days," he adds, "except for worship days."
Bodrogi identifies the appropriate bolt and chats with the cashier about kids and school as he completes his purchase.
"We all know one another here," Bodrogi explains as we leave. "Most families have lived here for generations.  The first new people that came to town were with that gas company that built a few years back."
I ask Bodrogi if business has been good. 
"We were doing pretty good until recently.  Profits were good and we add acreage, or upgrade equipment.  Then we started having all this trouble with the crops."
In what way, I asked.
"The crops aren't producing like they have in the past.  It took a while to figure out, then one of the city officers figured out to call in a water specialist.  When they tested it they said the water was contaminated."
Bodrodgi sighed, and with a beleaguered look in his eye he thanked me for my interest and told me he had to head back home.  The tractor had to be fixed before they could work the next day.  I thanked him and watched him climb into his truck and head out of town.
The water specialist turned out to be the international agency "Wellness For All", an international agency with a mission to bring healthy water to communities distressed by natural disasters, draught and - coincidentally - oil and gas development.
I caught up with a representative from Wellness for All the next day.  Joclyn Reynolds is project coordinator for "Wellness for All".  She spoke to me over a satellite call from her field office in Southeast Asia where she was setting up relief efforts following an earthquake. Ms. Reynolds agreed to speak to me for a few minutes between meetings about their work in Elodis.
"We were contacted by a city official about a problem they were having with their local water.  In the last few years agriculture had foundered, and the incidence of certain illnesses and birth defects had risen.  The Elodis drinking water comes from the Tiskele River, as does all the water for farming, so we looked for a source upstream.  We found sources of production waste disposal at the GAStech operation upstream.  Tests showed high levels of benzene, toluene, xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, among other toxins. "
"Can these substances occur naturally?" I asked her.
"Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly.  Groundwater contamination is usually the result of human activity.  The GAStech pipes are releasing contaminants into a pond.  The toxins are forming a subsurface plume that seeps into the Tiskele River from which the residents of Elodis draw their drinking water and irrigation for the crops."
"Did you talk to GAStech about this?"
"Oh yes," she replied.  "At first we believed we were gaining traction.  We met several times with GAStech representatives, including one of the senior executives, Hank Fluss.  He personally assured us GAStech would act responsibly to provide material and financial assistance toward cleanup efforts.  After a time, though, it became clear that while Mr. Fluss was earnest it was Sanjorge who makes the decisions.  It is apparent that he [Sanjorge] has no interest in the wellbeing of the residents of Elodis, or the environment."
Sten Sanjorge, Jr., who had inherited his share in the company from his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for cutthroat business practices.
"When we didn't make headway with GAStech," Reynolds continued, "the community leaders decided to approach the government of Kronos for assistance.   Per our policy -and with permission from the Elodis leaders - we published the test results in an official public document.  The Elodis leaders then approached the government officials as citizens of a Kronesian community armed with the scientific analysis.  Our agency assured them we would again be available to help in any way when those agreements were finalized."
At this point Ms Reynolds was called away from the phone, so I returned to my editor friend, Pondo Reese to tell finish the story.

AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard
PUBLISHED: 31 August 2001

LOCATION: ELODIS, Kronos

Government heavies obstructed the free speech - yet again - of members of the activist group Protectors of Kronos yesterday at a lawful demonstration at the Tiskele Bend fields.  The five POK activists had gathered in front of the gates to GAStech gas drilling operations facility to bring public awareness about the polluted Tiskele River which has caused health problems to the residents of Elodis.
Bystanders report that the demonstration had begun peacefully with the five POK members walking back and forth across the road, chanting "Remember Juliana!" and "No more poison!"  
An eyewitness told the Homeland Illumination that when the gates opened to allow GAStech company vehicles to exit the facility the protesters moved aside.  Witnesses agree that at the same time vehicles with the Government of Kronos seal drove to the gates, apparently planning to enter the facility. 
"It was all very civil up till then," Griffith Mabel, an Elodis resident who had come out to support the POK told the Homeland Illumination.   "The gates opened, the POK people moved and the trucks drove out.  That's when it got weird.  The trucks stopped in the middle of the road for no reason."
Another eyewitness, Elodis farmer Charley Normand adds, "Yeah, the POK guys asked the drivers to move nicely, but the GAStech drivers ignored them.  They had their windows down, so it wasn't like they couldn't hear them."
The occupants of the government vehicles exited and joined the altercation.  The sequence of events becomes confusing at this point.  Some witnesses state the GAStech drivers instigated arguments with the protestors, and others think the government officials began to strong arm the protesters from the road.
"Turns out the people in the government cars were police," Mabel tells the Homeland Illumination.  "They wore uniforms and had badges."
Onlookers tell the Homeland Illumination that the three parties began yelling, and at some point the Kronos police - presumably from Abila-  arrested the five activists and transported them to an Elodis jail.
Despite repeated requests for an interview, the Homeland Illumination has not been granted access to those arrested.

In a glitzy press conference late last year President Luis Araullo announced a historic set of tax incentives intended to bring foreign investment to Kronos under the guise creating jobs, providing cheap energy and building infrastructure.  Following the 86-14 vote last month the Minister of the Interior Tomas Sarto lauded the decision as "landmark" and "bettering the people".
We shall see.  The crafters of these revolutionary measures neglected to include a detailed plan about how this windfall would benefit everyday Kronosians.  When the first payment from these foreign company lands in the state coffers, how will these funds be dispersed?
One wonders:  Did the 14 who opposed the measure feel the same way?  Were they also wondering exactly how this money would be funneled into education, improvements in roads, utilities and healthcare?
Calls to the offices of the President were not returned.

TITLE: GASTECH TRUCK HITS AUTOMOBILE NEAR ELODIS, FAMILY OF FOUR DEAD

LOCATION: ELODIS, Kronos

A vehicle collision claimed the lives of an Elodis family, including two children Tuesday afternoon.  The family was traveling home from a school program where one of the children had performed in the Spring Program at Elodis Primary School.

Elodis Assistant Police Commissioner Adian Koppolis reported three of the victims died at the scene of the accident.  Marcellus Edris, 33, his wife Valeria, 30, their daughter Celia, 7 died at the scene of the accident.  A son, Carmine, survived the initial collision but died later at an Abila hospital.

The unidentified 25-year old driver of the GAStech truck was held overnight in the Elodis city jail, and then released.

Initial reports from the investigators state the truck driver had illegally entered the intersection where he had failed to halt at a stop sign, while the other vehicle had the right of way.

Commissioner Koppolis said Elodis police would conduct a full investigation.

TITLE: ELODIS, KRONOS:  A TOWN IN NEED, Part One
AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard
PUBLISHED: 19 March 1998

This article is the first installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos.
ELODIS, Kronos - Nestled in the bend of the Tiskele River, the sun rises over the farming town of Elodis,  chasing away the shadows cloaking nearby Mt. Bouro.  Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos.
Two weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around Tiskele Bend. In his email he described a once bountiful region now distressed by contamination, struggling to find solutions to a worsening problem.  I decided to investigate.
"We didn't make the connection at first," Reese told me when I met with him at his office.  "The gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away.   After a couple of harvests, we saw a decline in the production.   We thought perhaps it was just a hiccup, and things would get better.  Then when the kids started getting sick we took a harder look at what could have changed."
The change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out of Tethys.
Established in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis.
With a population of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a café where you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations.
"We've made a good living for a long time," Reese tells me. "The population has been steadily increasing.  Crop production has been good.  For the most part, kids haven't left for the city as they have in a lot of other rural places.  We have a lot of land that could yet be developed. There was a future for them here."
I asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech's operations.  He introduced me to a farmer whose family had been here for several generations.  
I caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at the Osvaldo hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm.
Part Two will be published April 25, 1998

Elian Karel, age 28, died Friday while unlawfully incarcerated at the Abila City Prison.  Karel was being held on fraudulent tax evasion charges after his arrest on March 12 earlier this year.
His attorney, Michale Kraft made the announcement Friday during a noon press conference.
"We don't know any details yet.  What I can tell you is that when I left Elian yesterday after meeting with him in the prison he was in excellent health and good spirits.  He was expecting to be released in the next few days and return to his work with the Protectors of Kronos, and was excited to continue the Protectors of Kronos mission to which he dedicated his life.  I can assure you that Elian's death will be investigated with all the resources at our disposal and those responsible will be brought to justice."
Supporters of the POK and others began gathering outside the police station as news spread.
"I can't believe it," Kriste Brontes said through her tears, "We were at the rally in March.  He looked and sounded so good.  He was so optimistic that changes were coming.  Who will be able to lead POK now?"
Karel, from Elodis, had been involved with the POK mission since he was young.  He was only a few years older than Juliana Vann, a friend who died in 1998 of toxin poisoning caused by illegal dumping from the Tethyn company GAStech. 
Calls to the President's office, the office of the Minister of Justice and the office of the Chief of Police were not immediately returned.

TITLE: POK RALLY DRAWS THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS
AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard
PUBLISHED: 7 March 2009

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos

Thousands of protesters carrying banners reading "Remember Juliana!" and chanting "We want truth!" rallied in front of the Kronos government offices Saturday morning. Protesters were demanding an accounting of the government revenues from then President Araullo's tax incentives that were signed into law in 1993.
Ten-year old Juliana Vann died in 1998 from an illness caused by contaminated water from GAStech drilling operations. She has become the heart-rending icon of a movement that has gained support from one end of Kronos to the other.
"We were promised better jobs, new roads, better healthcare and a better standard of living," said one 20-year old protestor who declined to have her name used.  "All I see are bigger mansions for the ministers and a hospital that costs more to fix than it can make.  We won't accept that!"
The protestor was referring to Abila General Hospital built in 1997 ostensibly with money from the increased revenue from the foreign gas operations here on Kronos.  The non-profit hospital has had difficulty maintaining its infrastructure, despite the extensive restoration performed sevearl years ago to replace the electrical and plumbing systems.
"The contracts were all given to family and cronies of the ministers," accuses 26-year old Jon L., who traveled six hours to attend yesterday's rally.  "What we need is transparency in our government.  We need to know what happens to all the money coming in from these foreign companies.
Protest leader Elian Karel addressed the demonstrators at Abila City park.  Karel took over POK leadership from Henk Bodrogi, whose ill health forced him down from the position.  Karel spoke eloquently about the beginnings of the POK campaign as a grassroots effort for clean water, to the dynamic movement it has become demanding improved government transparency and accountability.
"We aren't asking for anything unreasonable," Karel speaks passionately to his ardent listeners.  "All we want is to know how our taxes are being used.  We know these corporations are generating records profits at the expense of Kronos, but we see none of the promised improvements.  All we want is accountability for those who died because of greed, corruption and disregard of those who they should be protecting."
Calls to the President's office were not immediately returned.

TITLE: IN REMEMBRANCE:  THE DEATH OF ELIAN KAREL, A YEAR LATER
AUTHOR: Petrus Gerhard
PUBLISHED: 19 June 2010

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos

One year ago today a young man in search of a brighter future for his countrymen died in a cold, cement prison.  He was attended only by apathetic guards who had been charged with detaining him pending an investigation for tax fraud.  Instead, sometime in the early morning hours of 19 June, Elian Karel died with injuries inexplicable with the official cause of death.
The report released by the Abila City Coroner in July 2010 attributed Karel's death to sudden cardiac arrest, and the investigation was closed shortly thereafter.  Unnamed sources close to the investigation, however, have provided witness testimony that Karel's body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which occurred within hours before his death.
Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karel's death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence.
In the year since Karel's death the Protectors of Kronos have continued the mission to demand that the Kronos government implement a policy of transparency in government business, and to hold accountable the foreign companies that have contaminated Kronosian natural resources.
Supporters continue to mass in public places, determined that their cries for justice be heard.  Now intermixed with chants of "Remember Juliana!" one can also hear cries "Remember Elian!"

The tax incentives specifically target energy development companies, which the government hopes to lure to Kronos' rich, but yet undeveloped, gas fields.  Ministry of the Interior projections show that development of just the Tiskele Bend fields could bring in as many as 5,000 high paying jobs and yield billions of dollars of infrastructure development over the next 20 years.

The Protectors of Kronos (POK) are suspected of kidnapping up to fourteen GAStech employees from their headquarters building earlier today.  Abila police quickly secured the building and interviewed the remaining GAStech employees.  One employee, Edvard Vann of Abila, was questioned for hours because he shares a family name with several known POK members.  Vann denied involvement with the POK and claimed to have no knowledge of the kidnapping.  Tethyn federal law enforcement and representatives from the Tethyn Ministry of Foreign affairs flew to Kronos and were escorted to Abila police headquarters.

TITLE: Protestors Block Traffic to Tiskele Bend Fields

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

More than a dozen POK protesters were handcuffed and taken into custody by police Tuesday for blocking access to the Tiskele Bend fields.  Before police made the arrests shortly after 9 a.m., the protesters were told they were breaking the law for trespassing on government property, blocking access to government-owned land, and impeding lawful commercial traffic.  

The protesters arrived at the entrance to the Tiskele Bend site about 5:30 a.m. and locked arms across the road for about three hours, despite being asked to leave by police.  As traffic on the road began to back up, several truck drivers began to leave their vehicles and congregate near the protesters.  Tempers began to flare as the blockade persisted into the second hour, and the drivers started shouting and cursing at the protesters to move out of the road.  Police officers quickly moved in and arrested the POK protesters before the situation could escalate to violence.

Police used tear gas to end the gathering, but a handful of die-hard POK members urged the crowd into melee with the officers.  When the tear gas finally cleared, six POK member were arrested on charges of assault on civil authorities and inciting a crowd to violence.

TITLE: GAStech 

PUBLISHED: 22 February 2013

It is the biggest company in Kronos, the third largest gas company on the planet, and it is fifty-three years old. In the past it has had a reputation as corrupt and environmentally harmful, but nowadays GAStech, the former Tethys-only business, is trying to earn the trust of international investors. This forms part of its ambitions to expand its profitable business supplying gas outside of the Mediterranean region.

It is an uphill task, and there is no certainty that Gastech has the ability to convince potential investors it has mended its ways, and is no longer rooted in the eco-hostile past.
GAStech's pipeline operations are based in eastern Kronos, and there is close relationship with the Kronosian government. This is the heart of Kronos's pipeline business, where gas from the eastern gas fields is piped west towards the rest of Kronos, Tethys and Europe.

GAStech does more than just pump gas. It has created towns and cities to service its operations, which it manages and runs almost single-handed.
The head of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, whose photo stares out from calendars and picture frames everywhere in the country, acknowledges the "state within a state" accusations, but argues that the company simply needs to look after its workers and the communities around them.

Of course, people need good reasons to come and work in the hostile remote Kronosian regions. They are provided with medical care, entertainment, and food. The GAStech empire owns 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its company farms, runs gyms, and offers subsidised holidays in Black Sea resorts for key employees. For executives, it runs a state of the art, marble-lined medical and therapy centre.

In addition to all of these perks, there is also the GAStech TV station, which doesn't even pretend to be unbiased. It's there to serve the company's will.

It hardly seems the picture of a modern global company, as most of those have unceremoniously dumped their "non-core activities". There is an argument, however, that the energy business is different from other industries, requiring energy corporations to operate in distinct ways.

Working in far-off places with no previous infrastructure means oil and gas sites will always be, to some extent, company towns. GAStech certainly strives to ensure its employees can move in and out of these locations by operating a private fleet of four planes to ferry its staff the huge distances between sites.

TITLE: GASTech Employees Kidnapped in Kronos

PUBLISHED: 21 January 2014  1405
Fourteen employees feared kidnapped in Kronos by a radical environmental terrorist group during a corporate gathering. 

Fourteen employees, including possibly five executive officers, are feared kidnapped yesterday by the "Protectors of Kronos".  Reported missing includes: GAStech President and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr,CFO Ingrid Barranco, CIO Ada Campo-Corrente, COO Orhan Strum, and Environmental Officer Willem Vasco-Pais.

Local news organizations have received a ransom note from the POK claiming responsibility and demanding $20 Million from the company.  It is possible additional demands are forthcoming.

Sanjorge and the others disappeared following a board meeting at GASTech headquarters.  A fire alarm went off, and the execs were discovered missing shortly after that.  The complete list of all the unaccounted-for employees has not been released. 
John Rathburn, an American expert on executive kidnappings who is living in Tethys, says that Kronos has not been known as an archetypal country for kidnapping. "However, increased activity by POK, APA [Asterian People's Army], and others in the region have significantly increased the risk."

The Times's correspondent in Abila says GASTech offices are closed, and phone calls are being answered but referred to local authorities.  

GASTech's corporate headquarters in Tethys have refused to comment. However, other news sources have reported Tethys federal law enforcement officials and staff from the Tethan Ministry of Foreign Affairs have arrived in Kronos to assist police in the investigation.

TITLE: Kronos' oil and gas industry has warned it faces its "biggest challenge in 20 years" due to the low levels of exploration.

PUBLISHED: 20 February 2012

Government energy officials said only 15 wells were drilled last year.
That was despite strong levels of investment, reaching a record last year and sustained this year.
Exploration drilling was down from 26 wells six years ago, only sufficient to recover a fraction of the estimated oil and gas remaining in the countries oil and gas fields.


"Kronos' fields contain an abundance of oil and gas yet to be found and it is critical we find the means to turn the current state of exploration around" -Energy Minister Jules Jecovic
The annual activity survey by Oil and Gas Kronos found a rapid increase in production costs, up by 15% last year.
The average cost of extracting a barrel of oil was up by 27% in only a year, to reach K17.
The number of fields with cost per barrel above K30 has doubled in the last 12 months.
Rising costs were cited last week by GAStech, which is considering future investments in Norway and North America, rather than Kronos fields.

With rising costs, production tax payments to the Kronos Treasury are expected to fall from K3.5bn during the 2011-12 financial year to K2bn in the current year.

Following the rapid decline in oil and gas production from Kronos fields in recent years, the rate of fall slowed during 2012 - down by 8% to .83m barrels of oil per day, or its gas equivalent.

Jecovic stated "Kronos' fields contain an abundance of oil and gas yet to be found and it is critical we find the means to turn the current state of exploration around. Equipment availability and access to capital are the two main barriers noted by our Ministry."

TITLE: Profile:  Elian Karel 

PUBLISHED: 22 June 2009

<<deleted image of Elian Karel speaking at a rally in Abila>>
Voice of protest for some, popularist demagogue for others, Protectors of Kronos leader Elian Karel became a martyr and a rallying point for some; a figure of disdain and rabblerousing for others, and a political concern to the Kronosian government, within an event filled year, accented by his suspicious death on Friday. 

The leader of a forbearant environmental activist group, Karel had started a brand of politics all his own, that propelled the POK into the spotlight of this island nation.

Fueled by a growing dissatisfaction with the heavy-handed Kronosian government, he started driving the POK into an action-based organization, instead of one waiting for their government to make things aright.


Resurrecting the embers of the Juliana Vann campaign, the 10 year old girl who died from illnesses attributed to the government-favored GASTech corporation's industrial waste streams in 1998, Karel was arrested and thrown in jail following a POK-initiated human roadblock in front of GAStech headquarters in May. Karel died Wednesday while serving time in jail. The government of Kronos refuses comment on the circumstances of his death.

Rather charismatic, Karel was able to inspire a crowd and draw attention to the POK social and political agenda.  He could also tickle the funny bone of his audiences.  Once, after GAStech CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. likened the POK to a terrorist group in a press interview, Karel  quipped, "Sanjorge is a brilliant leader of GAStech. Do you know why he takes a ladder with him to the supermarket?  He heard that food prices in Abila are really high."

However, his ability to engage ultimately with the strong armed Kronos government had never been clear.  It is also unclear who will take his mantle in the POK now he is gone.

TITLE: Abila police break up sit-in turned violent at the presidential manor 

PUBLISHED: 20 June 2012

Traffic snarled around the city as Abilians struggle to get to work amid vandalism and looting
Early on Tuesday police stormed the front of the presidential mansion and the capital building, breaking up a sit in by the Protectors of Kronos.

Other activist groups have joined the protesting faction in solidarity and a bigger rally was predicted for later in the day.
The conservative Kronos government used an emergency law to threaten the protestors with arrest unless they dispersed and returned to work.  The row is over environmental issues the POK holds the government and the gas giant GAStech international responsible.
The rallies had begun peacefully, however more destructive activities have escalated as the crowds became more restless. 
Signs among the protester called for government change and social equality.  Images of Juliana Vann, the 10 year old girl who died from illnesses attributed to the industrial giant GAStech international served as rallying points.

People heading to a pro-government counter-rally were attacked by POK supporters, and later shots were fired.  
Tuesday was the third anniversary of the mysterious death of Elian Karel, a popular leader of the POK who died in prison. 
Later in the day, what had been a largely peaceful demonstration turned violent when the crowd started vandalizing government buildings and the presidential homestead.  

A group of younger protestors attacked vehicles, smashing windows.  Minor injuries were reported. 
Police reinforcements were sent to the area and blocked roads, and skirmishes between the police and protestors broke out. 
Police used tear gas to break up the unruly crowd.  Government spokesmen complemented the security forces for their handling of the "gangs of criminals" disrupting the peace.

TITLE: Interpol has announced the formation of a new multi-country task force

Interpol has announced the formation of a new multi-country task force to combat the increasingly wide distribution of the drug methyldimethyl cathinone (MDMC).  Heading the task force is Senior Inspector Robert Loblaw, a veteran officer who led the very successful Tethys Counterdrug Team.  He is optimistic that he can identify the source.

"These designer drugs have certain clues as to their origin," Loblaw told the Times in an interview.  "Every time the recipe is changed, it leaves clues as to who made it.  It's like a pedigree."

This particular blend of the drug MDMC, also known by its street names "cotton candy", "spice dreams" and "Tulip Blossom", was found previously only in Asteria but has made its way to the streets of Tethys and other international countries.

"I'll be looking hard at the activities of the Asterian People's Army," Loblaw said.  "Our previous investigations pointed to them as the source of this particular formulation."

The Asterian People's Army (APA) is a paramilitary organization which has been engaged in terrorist activities funded through its criminal enterprises, which include drug trafficking.  In recent years the APA has sought to build their brand through websites and the publication of a professional, high-quality magazine called "Arise".

Senior Inspector Loblaw says the Tethys public statistics indicate MDMC is a growing problem with the country's youth.  "An increase in mental health problems, including hallucinations and paranoia, accompanied by violent behavior and a marked increase in suicide rates are only a few of the indicators of the usage of this designer drug."

"As a first step we have alerted port officials to be on the lookout for suspicious shipments of insecticides and detergent, both similar in appearance to MDMC."

TITLE: Global disasters drain charity coffers

PUBLISHED: 14 November 1999
New appeals campaigns on the horizon to maintain liquidity.
Aid agencies have warned that the monetary and food needs have increased worldwide and that they may not be able to meet basic needs.
The UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says that 15 million people remain in need of vital goods and services, because the number and severity of crises has resulted in a lack of "food, healthcare, and access to livelihoods."
One new aid group, CARING Singapore has been recently formed In response to the conflict in Kosovo.  Dr. Jayala Mahmed was unable to find an existing organization to sponsor her to volunteer her medical services there.  CARING Singapore has sent five missions to Kosovo to provide mobile medical care.  They have also launched a fundraising effort in collaboration with the governments of Malaysia.  "We stand ready to help, but funding is difficult to find," stated Dr. Mahmed. "So much is needed but so much has already been spent."
Thirteen people were injured on Tuesday in Izmit, Turkey, as people mobbed a government relief convoy, officials said.  Some 20,000 people are feared dead in the two earthquakes that have occurred this year.  CARING Singapore has dispatched relief teams to Turkey.

Yet, aid organizations are stretched to their limits.  Wellness for All assisted ad-hoc emergency medical teams during the September earthquake in central Taiwan that measured 7.3 on the Richter scale.  "The response from the Emergency Teams was impressive, but uncoordinated," stated a Wellness for All spokesperson.  "We were never sure if we were headed to locations most desperate.  We soon ran out of medicines and funds to support our aid teams and had to return home."  While the global press reported over 2500 people were killed and 100,000 buildings were destroyed, local press reported people felt they were being properly cared for and declined relief aid. 
The Global Emergency Disaster Organization report their members are doing all they can to get aid through to earthquake victims, but they need a huge injections of funds to do so.  
Jim Cordon, from the disaster relief charity FoodSupport told the times "I think that the lack of funds are responsible for an increase of attacks on food convoys, consequently deterring a lot of aid agencies from getting in there."

Demonstrators in Abilia, Kronos have set fire to government buildings, in another round of unrest in this torn city
Dozens of people have been injured in protests over perceived government corruption and perceived inability of politicians to improve the situation.
Police used rubber bullets and tear gas to quell unrest in the capital Abila . Black smoke could be seen coming from the presidency compound in Abila.
<< Continue reading the main story >>	
A Protectors of Kronos spokesperson stated "In Kronos the legacies of the environmental neglect and lack of concern for the people mean that few even hope for change anymore. For this reason, anger has been simmering for years, but now it has boiled over"
Police used water to disperse the protesters who were throwing stones at the building. There were also reports of an attempted storming of the office.
"People protest because they are suffering, because they don't have medical help. We demand the government resign," Terek Kamal, a truck driver, told the Times.
The unrest began in Abila earlier in the week, with protests over the dismissal of several Kronosian employees from energy giant GAStech International.  GAStech has its roots in Tethys, although many directors live in Kronos.
This appears to be a case of simmering frustration boiling over.


The administration is highly supportive of GAStech and its tax income to the government coffers - yet seems to ignore any pressing issues but its own above-average pay packets.
The environmental  situation is desperate. Hundreds of rural citizens are suffering major illnesses apparently caused by exposure to GAStech waste streams, although this has not been official substantiated or acknowledge by either the company or government. 


That is what sparked the initial protests in Abila - but empathy with their cause brought demonstrators out in towns across Kronos.  Initially peaceful, these protest are now increasingly violent, and both police and citizens are caught in sometime fatal crossfire.  
Kronos President  Dorel Kapelou II is quoted as saying he would be calling an urgent meeting of the top leadership to address the "terrorist threat to peace" in the country.

The Protectors of Kronos
    Kronos's oldest and largest environmental activist organization
    Founded in 1997.
    Influenced by international groups such as Wellness for All
    Mixes political activism with environmental work
    Rejects use of violence and supports democratic principles

    Slogan: "Justice for Juliana", a reference to a 10-year old Kronosian girl who died as a result of government sponsored environmental contamination 

    

The decision was in response to Tuesday's bombing of a police headquarters in Abila, he said.
"Kronos was horrified from north to south by the hideous crime committed by the POK," Mr. Drymiau said.
"This was in context of dangerous escalation to violence against Kronos and Kronosians and a clear declaration by the POK that it knows nothing but violence.
"It's not possible for Kronos the state nor Kronos the people to submit to the POK terrorism."

Kronos would notify Tethys who had signed a 1998 anti-terrorism treaty of the decision, he added.
POK supporters

The POK has denied being responsible for the attack, and accused the Kronos government of staging a frame-up to silence the groups concerns for the people.
A POK member told the Times that the government's decision was "illegitimate".
He added: "The protests will continue, certainly."

TITLE: Centrum's central role in the Tethan Gas Industry 

PUBLISHED: 2 October 1982

The world of gas is distant, difficult and far flung. In Tethys a few years ago, I journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of Tethys to look at a contentious new energy producing area.
One of the sites I visited was a local office of the Sanjorge Gas company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation. As I remember it, a former trucker was in charge.
It was a vivid example of how a once small exploration company from Thethys had begun to grow into a mighty international force in the energy industry.
But I'd forgotten about the encounter until I went back to Tethys the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: one man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it.
But as I went round the capital city of Centrum interviewing people, I soon realised that this was not just a story of new energy. Something very significant has happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas industry expertise. From what's developed in the capital city there are important lessons for other places blessed (and cursed) with abundant natural resources.
"Centrum developed world class expertise in engineering in very difficult surroundings"

When I was a young newspaperman on the Daily Record in Glasgow in the early 1970s, the great off-shore oil rush was beginning in the North Sea. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, turning an island of coal into a place with abundant oil and gas supplies.
It seemed to us on the west coast of Scotland that the far flung city of Centrum, Tethys was getting a bit big for its boots, starting to believe in a new fantasy industry.
Much to his mother's regrets, meanwhile, Sten Sanjorge had started prospecting in the early 1960s.

By the early 1970s, a new gas company, GAStech, began its juggernaut-like advances.
Under his canny guidance, GAStech evolved into a major supplier of natural gas to the local region, and then much further afield. It now has thousands employees and operates in numerous countries. 

The change in Centrum has been substantial.  You notice them in the constant clutter of helicopters to-ing and fro-ing out to remote areas, and the planes lined up at the city's airport to shuttle execs back and forth from the city.
And as you drive round Centrum, almost every roundabout is sponsored by a division of GAStech. 

Sanjorge has recently started paying more attention to leisure activities and philanthropy, allowing his son Sten Jr. and co-founder Hank Fluss to run the company. But Sanjorge has just been asked to produce a report for the Tethan government recommending the best ways of ensuring that Tethys continues to produce energy for decades to come.

The easy-to-get stuff has been produced, so keeping the gas coming will need much investment and more clever new techniques, such as the hyper-acidic substrate removal techniques developed by the company in 1974. 
So thanks to clever people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, Centrum has achieved what every place where raw materials are discovered longs to do. The city has taken the temporary boon of energy on its doorstep, and turned it into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which may make Centrum a centre of gas expertise long after the gas itself runs out.

TITLE: Abila Hospitals Seeing Influx of Designer Drug Users

PUBLISHED: 7 February 2013
The Emergency Department at Abila General Hospital in Kronos has been swamped in the last month by people suffering medical complications from designer drugs such as "cotton candy" and synthetic marijuana, a hospital official said.
"We have had at least two dozen cases in the last month," said Alicia Bianca, nurse manager of the department. "We are literally overwhelmed."
Bianca said she has never seen this level of activity related to drug overdoses in the seven years she has managed the Emergency Department and in the 20 years she has been a nurse.

Authorities in Abila said "cotton candy" may have been a factor in the death of 54-year-old Ralf Potter, whose bruised and naked body was found February 4 along a dead-end road. Investigators are awaiting toxicology reports to determine the cause of his death. Citywide, several deaths have been attributed to "Cotton Candy" according to the Kronos National Poison Center.


Patients are coming to Abila General from throughout the greater city region, and they include adults and youths, male and female, and all socio-economic backgrounds, Bianca said.


Sgt Antonio Arresta of the Abila Fire Department, a first-responder to emergency medical calls in the city, said his department has also seen a spike in the number of people needing treatment for complications from designer drugs. "We went from zero calls to a handful of calls" in the last month," he said.
Bianca and Arresta said their efforts to treat people is made more difficult because they often do not know anything about the designer drugs that were taken.
"You don't know what you're getting when you get it," Bianca said. "We have had patients come in and act out of control, who are very violent. They tell us they have been doing cotton candy or synthetic marijuana."
Bianca said there is little clinical data on the effects of cotton candy, as it is an emerging toxicant. "There are no controlled studies in toxicology," she said. The national poison center collects anecdotal reports on overdoses from hospitals and other providers as part of efforts to offer advice on how to treat patients.
Designer drugs are chemical compounds synthesized to resemble the active ingredient in often illegal drugs. Cotton candy mimics the drug khat, a stimulant. Manufacturers frequently change the designer drug's chemical composition and its name to stay one step ahead of authorities, Biance said. "It is another way to sell it," she said.
The term cotton candy, for example, is a nickname of the drug and has nothing to do with the carnival treat. The drug has been sold under the name of "Spice Dreams" one week and under the name of "Tulip Blossom" the next. 
The Kronos government has placed three of the chemicals commonly used in the creation of cotton candy on its controlled substance list, criminalizing their use and possession. Still, the government cannot outright ban cotton candy because manufacturers can alter the recipe and skirt the law, Bianca said. The drugs are sold online as "herbal therapy" products and are available over the counter in area stores.
"We still don't know what you are getting with cotton candy. The chemical composition varies from package to package," Bianca said.
One factor for the popularity of cotton candy is its low cost, Bianca said. She said a gram of cotton candy costs about K18 while a gram of cocaine costs K166.

Cotton candy creates euphoria, or a high, that is equal to or greater than that of cocaine but also causes a crash that is worse, Bianca said. The crash's ill-effects often prompt people to binge on cotton candy to the point where they consume the drug for days. "They crave it," she said.
After repeated use, the drug "fries" a person's brain, draining the chemicals that balance its operations. This sometimes leads to bizarre, often psychotic behavior that has been reported in the media, such as the case of the naked man in Elodis who was found running down the middle of a major highway, Bianca said. "The seizures and delusions are incredible," she said.
While it is not yet certain who is behind the distribution of this round of designer drugs, police suspect organized crime is pursuing this large income source. The Asterian People's Army has traditionally been involved with drug trafficking throughout the region, and enforcement agencies are closely examining possible cooperation between drug trafficking organizations and political insurgent groups.

TITLE: Shale gas pioneer plans world's first offshore wells in Mediterranean Sea 

PUBLISHED: 3 May 1984

<<Deleted Image: Anti-offshore drilling protester.  Exploration has proved a controversial issue in Kronos>>
Continue reading the main story	
The son of the founder of gas firm GAStech is planning a venture to drill in the Mediterranean Sea, the Times has learned.
Sten Sanjorge, Jr. believes there are large volumes of offshore gas that could be extracted.
Sanjorge and GAStech were awarded three licences by the Kronos government last month by the Ministry for Energy and Development and hopes to begin exploration soon.
"Certainly offshore gas isn't a new concept, but there's no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can't develop these resources offshore," he told the Times.

Shale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within.

Hyper-acidic substrate removal has produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the West, transforming the energy market. But projects in Europe have been slow to take off, beset with opposition from government and local communities.
Sanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited.

Many environmentalists believe that hyper-acidic substrate removal can damage marine environments, and oppose the extraction of new fossil fuel resources. But drilling offshore avoids the need for difficult negotiations with local councils, communities and landholders.

Based on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech's estimates for its onshore resources. There is also the possibility of finding oil.
GAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore.

"We're very comfortable that the resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous," SanJorge said. "Is any of that exploitable? That's the billion dollar question, and GAStech is wiling to invest in the answer."

Though it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done.
Professor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term.

"GAStech is being optimistic is its estimates of how long it will take to explore offshore shale. It's perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyper-acidic substrate removal technology will have so advanced and the way in which we deal with the offshore environment will have so advanced that this could be a really big industry. The task in the next 10 years is to try these things out, see if they work."

POK members held their annual demonstration in Abila yesterday.  A larger than usual crowd gathered in front of the Capitol building, waving signs holding pictures of Elian Karel and Juliana Vann, who were painted as POK "martyrs".  The crowds chanted about government corruption and called for President Dorel Kapelou to step down.  Several protestors carried signs calling for an end to the "exploitive Tethys corporate capitalism" and alleging, "GAStech poisoned our kids".  

Police and government security forces set up between the protestors and the Capitol building in a show of force, hoping to prevent the kind of chaos that occurred during last year's riot.  However, after several hours of chanting and speeches, tempers in the crowd flared and protestors rushed the police line.  The police forces were forced to use tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons, and rubber bullets to subdue the crowd and protect property.  In spite of their heroic efforts, the protestors managed to break some windows, damage several police vehicles, and injure three officers.

Dozens of protesters attending a Protectors of Kronos (POK) rally in front of the GAStech regional headquarters in Abila were arrested for trespassing this morning.  The POK rally was intended to draw attention to their claims of environmental damage being caused by the development of gas and oil fields around Kronos by foreign corporations like GAStech.  About two hundred people gathered in front of the GAStech building chanting slogans and waving signs that held the visages of people who have allegedly died due to environmental contamination.  Ten of the protestors chained themselves to the doors of the building in an attempt to prevent GAStech employees from going to work.

Police spokesman Adrien Carman said, "We allowed the group some latitude with their rally, but when GAStech complained that the protestors were blocking entrance to their building, we had to take action.  The last thing we wanted to happen was for a GAStech employee to get hurt by the crowd just because he was trying to go to work."

The POK, once a small political activist group of citizens from the Elodis area, has been revitalization under the charismatic leadership of Elian Karel.  Government spokesman Rufus Drymiau said of today's POK rally, "We have been concerned by a pattern of increasingly aggressive tactics by the Protectors of Kronos for some time now. In light of today's incident, President Kapelou has ordered the police to provide additional protection for the public at future POK rallys."

Five young people were arrested yesterday for protesting near the entrance to the Tiskele Bend fields as they called for government action to address their environmental concerns about GAStech's operations at the site.  The protestors, members of the activist group "Protectors of Kronos", held signs reading: "Drilling Poisoned Our Water" and "Remember Juliana", referring to 10 year old Juliana Vann, who has become an icon for the Protectors of Kronos since her death in 1998.  The protestors were arrested after one young man threw his sign at a government vehicle, cracking its window and startling the occupants.  Police spokesman Adrien Carman said of the arrests, "We decided to shut the protest down before the POK members escalated to further violence.  They were getting pretty animated out there."

"These 'Protectors of Kronos' are really a fringe minority of people against the extraction of fossils fuels in our country," said Government spokesman Carmine Gurganus.  "The people of Kronos have overwhelmingly been for the development of our natural resources and all have benefited from the resultant economic growth.

It is with great sorrow that we announce the death of Minister of Health Cesare Nespola.  Minister Nespola, 62, died peacefully in his sleep yesterday of a suspected heart attack.  A tireless champion for the welfare of our people, Nespola was a physician who had been picked to lead the Ministry of Health in 1995 by former president Araullo.  He was popular enough that President Kapelou retained him when he formed his cabinet in 2000.

Shortly after hearing of Nespola's death, President Kapelou announced that his nephew Vincent Kapelou would serve as his administration's new Minister of Health.  Vincent Kapelou, 28, has a Bachelor's of Science in chemistry and a Master's of Science in biochemistry from Tethys Central University.

POK members held a large demonstration in Abila yesterday.  Several dozen of their supporters held sit-ins in front of the capitol building and the presidential manor, while others took to the streets with their signs and chants.  Protestors handed out flyers to bystanders that alleged that our government is corrupt and "the rich get richer on the backs of the poor".  Police called for the peaceful end to the sit-ins, but were answered with a barrage of rocks and bottles from the crowd.  The violence escalated into a full blown riot and police were forced to use tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons, and beanbags shot from shotguns to control the crowd.  

By the time the crowds finally dispersed, several government buildings had been vandalized, two police vehicles were ablaze, and the streets were littered with trash and broken glass.  Several protestors and police were injured, including one heroic police officer who was stabbed by a crazed protestor.  The officer, whose name has been withheld for security reasons, is in critical condition at Abila General Hospital.

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos

Today is the fifth anniversary of President Araullo's visionary plan to bring foreign investment to Kronos, a bold act that has reaped tremendous benefits for our fair country.  Today's Abila is a bustling metropolis full of new cars, new construction, gleaming office buildings, and modern conveniences.  Gone are the potholed streets, run-down factories, tired storefronts, and sad marketplaces of the past.  Today's Abila is a city of industry, a place of commerce and investment, a place of opportunity and success.  Prosperity has come to Kronos, and we are all the better for it.

However, there are still those who wrongly think that prosperity is bad for us.  These people claim that foreign investment is bad for our country, that it is diluting our culture and undermining our values.  They claim that the foreigners are exploiting us for their own gain and that our government has little regard for the welfare of our people.  They are so militant in their wrong-headed beliefs that they have fabricated claims that the foreign companies are poisoning our children with their technology.  They have even gone so far as to have brought in foreign "experts" who claim to "have our best interests at heart" to help spread their agenda against progress and prosperity for our people.  The hypocrisy of bringing in foreigners to tell us that opening our country to foreigners is bad for us is ludicrous and is obviously a sign of mental illness in those who oppose our modernization.

A press release from the Ministry of Interior today announced that the Tiskele Bend gas fields could be as much as 5 times larger than originally estimated.  When we contacted Minister Sarto's office for comment, he said, "We were astounded by the results of GAStech's recent survey of Tiskele Bend.  I mean, this is just huge for the people of Kronos.  We have already undertaken several large improvement projects like the port expansion and the new hospital that we would not otherwise have been able to do because of the taxes we are seeing from our foreign investments.  This news almost assures we'll be able to reap those same dividends for decades to come!"

It goes without saying that President Araullo's plan to lure foreign investment has been a defining moment in our history.  One hopes that those who had been so shortsighted as to oppose his plan have finally come to their senses.  We will say what they are too proud to say: Thank you, Mr. President.

President Araullo announced today that his government is planning the construction of a new, modern Abila General Hospital.  The old Abila General Hospital, built in 1930, has outdated health care facilities and has suffered numerous electrical fires in the past decade.  Hospital Administrator Torsten Trucco lauded the government's action saying, "We've been trying to get funding to update our facilities for years, to no avail.  We have been living on borrowed time for quite a while now with the old boiler.  It's been pure luck that the old girl hasn't failed on us completely."

The new Abila General will have 350 beds, a substantial upgrade from the mere 100 beds of the current antiquated facility.  Additionally, it will have a full emergency services area, trauma and burn care units, a psychiatric care wing, and four ultra-modern surgical suites.  In his announcement of the new construction, Araullo said, "Our strategy of courting foreign investment is paying great dividends.  This new hospital is the first of many projects we plan to pursue to help upgrade our standard of living and modernize our lifestyle."

POK supporters carried signs with pictures of Karel and Juliana Vann, chanted slogans, and lit candles. 

The peaceful demonstration turned violent when two POK members accosted a man who attempted to enter the building on business.  The POK members hit him with a bottle, which knocked him to the ground and gave him a bloody gash on his forehead.  Abila police attempted to gain control of the situation by using bullhorns to call for the peaceful dispersal of the crowd, but the crowd responded to their calls by hurling insults along with a few rocks at the officers.  Police used tear gas to end the gathering, but a handful of die-hard POK members urged the crowd into melee with the officers.  Additional security forces had to be summoned to help contain the situation as the violence escalated.  When the tear gas finally cleared, six POK member were arrested on charges of assault on civil authorities and inciting a crowd to violence.  Three police officers were treated at Abila General Hospital for wounds received in the fight.

"We had been concerned that Silvia Marek's weak leadership is allowing the POK to be taken over by criminals and hooligans.  Today's events show that our concerns were valid," said police spokesman Adrien Carman.  Marek replaced Elian Karel as the popular figurehead of the POK movement last summer.

In a statement to the press today, government spokesman Rufus Drymiau said of the POK: "they are justifiably a public threat due to violent demonstrations, opportunistic vandalism, and clashes with the police."  Violence and vandalism have become a trademark of POK gatherings lately.  "They have caused thousands of dollars in damage to buildings and businesses, showing they have little care for the plight of the people.  President Kapelou will not let their mayhem continue unchallenged," said Drymiau.

A rally of hundreds of protestors allied with the "Protectors of Kronos" movement turned to violence today as angry activists vented their displeasure on the innocent citizens of Abila after hearing the news of POK leader Elian Karel's death.  Karel, who had been awaiting trial for tax evasion, was found dead in his jail cell yesterday morning.  

The POK assembly began peacefully enough with the usual chanted slogans and waving of protest signs, but then one young rabble-rouser grabbed a bullhorn and began inciting the crowd to violence.  The crowd smashed windows and vandalized shops in the Siopa area, set fires in the streets, and clashed with police.  Additional police forces responded to contain the chaos and they were forced to use rubber bullets and tear gas in order to disperse the crowds.

President Kapelou's office released a statement about the rally, stating, "This sort of violence will not be condoned.  Destruction and violence is no way to achieve peace and change - these things are in opposition to each other.  The Protectors of Kronos must resume peaceful means; all other approaches are unjustifiable."

Minister of Health Cesare Nespola announced today that his organization would be investigating claims of abnormal health issues in areas surrounding the Tiskele Bend drill site.  Minister Nespola said, "We have no reason to believe that the drilling at Tiskele Bend has resulted in any contamination of surface or well water in the region.  However, I believe it is important as Minister of Health to do due diligence and investigate the reports of sickness near the Elodis township.  Taking care of our people is my number one priority."

In related news, a press release from Nespola's office proclaimed that his office has granted a license to practice medicine to a Tethys oncologist, making him the first licensed oncologist in Kronos history.  Dr. Ronald Gerard will be a resident at the Abila General Hospital.

Today the Parliament voted 86 to 14 in favor of President Araullo's package of tax incentives designed to lure foreign investment to our fair country. Tomas Sarto, Minister of the Interior, lauded the vote as "a landmark deal designed to better the lives of all Kronosians".  

The tax incentives specifically target energy development companies, which the government hopes to lure to Kronos' rich, but yet undeveloped, gas fields.  Ministry of the Interior projections show that development of just the Tiskele Bend fields could bring in as many as 5,000 high paying jobs and yield billions of dollars of infrastructure development over the next 20 years.

President Araullo today announced the signing of an agreement between his government and the Tethys-based GAStech International for the development of the Tiskele Bend gas fields.  GAStech, under the leadership of visionary Sten Sanjorge Jr., was awarded exclusive rights to drill in the government-owned fields after agreeing to the government's request that 50% or more of the workforce be Kronosian citizens.  President Araullo hailed the landmark deal as "the beginning of a new era for our great country, an era of opportunity and fortune for all."  Our sources at the Ministry of Interior tell us that the 50% tax levied on new oil and gas exploration could yield in excess of $1 billion in tax revenue per year.  This will allow the government to make unprecedented investments into infrastructure, health care, and education.

Police spokesman Adrien Carman said Tethyn federal law enforcement agencies are assisting in the investigation.

The POK is suspected of conducting the kidnapping, but they have yet to claim credit or release a ransom request.  The POK rhetoric has become increasingly anarchist and their actions more criminal and violent over the past several years.

More than a dozen POK protesters were handcuffed and taken into custody by police Tuesday for blocking access to the Tiskele Bend fields.  Before police made the arrests shortly after 9 a.m., the protesters were told they were breaking the law for trespassing on government property, blocking access to government-owned land, and impeding lawful commercial traffic. 

The protesters arrived at the entrance to the Tiskele Bend site about 5:30 a.m. and locked arms across the road for about three hours, despite being asked to leave by police.  As traffic on the road began to back up, several truck drivers began to leave their vehicles and congregate near the protesters.  Tempers began to flare as the blockade persisted into the second hour, and the drivers started shouting and cursing at the protesters to move out of the road.  Police officers quickly moved in and arrested the POK protesters before the situation could escalate to violence.  

"We appreciate citizens voicing their opinion, but the middle of a busy road is not the right forum for a discussion of our national environmental policy. We encourage our concerned citizens to follow the democratic process and contact their Assembly representatives," government spokesman Rufus Drymiau said in a statement.

Kronos police arrested Elian Karel today on charges of tax evasion.  Karel, the leader of the activist group "Protectors of Kronos", was conducting a meeting with his supporters when he was arrested.  Karel tried to make light of the situation, but his followers were clearly concerned about the seriousness of the charges leveled against him.  Karel's lawyer, Michale Kraft, released a statement declaring that the charges against his client were false and that he hoped to have Karel released from police custody by week's end.  In response to Kraft's statement, Police spokesman Adrien Carman said, "I think Mr. Kraft has underestimated the seriousness of his client's situation."  It is clear that Elian Karel, who professes to have the interests of the people of Kronos at heart, must explain to us why he refuses to contribute to the welfare of his nation.

TITLE: Abila Hospitals Seeing Influx of Designer Drug Users 

PUBLISHED: 2013/02/08

The Emergency Department at Abila General Hospital in Kronos has been swamped in the last month by people suffering medical complications from designer drugs such as "cotton candy" and synthetic marijuana, a hospital official said. Citywide, several deaths have been attributed to "Cotton Candy" according to the Kronos National Poison Center. 

Designer drugs are chemical compounds synthesized to resemble the active ingredient in often illegal drugs. Cotton candy mimics the drug khat, a stimulant. Manufacturers frequently change the designer drug's chemical composition and its name to stay one step ahead of authorities, Biance said. 

The term cotton candy, for example, is a nickname of the drug and has nothing to do with the carnival treat.  

The Kronos government has placed three of the chemicals commonly used in the creation of cotton candy on its controlled substance list, criminalizing their use and possession. Still, the government cannot outright ban cotton candy because manufacturers can alter the recipe and skirt the law, Bianca said. She said a gram of cotton candy costs about K18 while a gram of cocaine costs K166. The crash's ill-effects often prompt people to binge on cotton candy to the point where they consume the drug for days. The Asterian People's Army has traditionally been involved with drug trafficking throughout the region, and enforcement agencies are closely examining possible cooperation between drug trafficking organizations and political insurgent groups.

A rally of hundreds of protestors allied with the "Protectors of Kronos" movement turned to violence today as angry activists vented their displeasure on the innocent citizens of Abila after hearing the news of POK leader Elian Karel's death.   

The POK assembly began peacefully enough with the usual chanted slogans and waving of protest signs, but then one young rabble-rouser grabbed a bullhorn and began inciting the crowd to violence.

Voice of protest for some, popularist demagogue for others, Protectors of Kronos leader Elian Karel became a martyr and a rallying point for some; 

Resurrecting the embers of the Juliana Vann campaign, the 10 year old girl who died from illnesses attributed to the government-favored GASTech corporation's industrial waste streams in 1998, Karel was arrested and thrown in jail following a POK-initiated human roadblock in front of GAStech headquarters in May. Karel died Wednesday while serving time in jail.

With the third anniversary of Elian Karel's death approaching - former member of the Protectors of Kronos - the question is: who are the protesters? The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion.  

The POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people.

The son of the founder of gas firm GAStech is planning a venture to drill in the Mediterranean Sea, the Times has learned. believes there are large volumes of offshore gas that could be extracted. 

"Certainly offshore gas isn't a new concept, but there's no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can't develop these resources offshore," he told the Times. 

Shale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within. 

GAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done.

The head of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, whose photo stares out from calendars and picture frames everywhere in the country, acknowledges the "state within a state" accusations, but argues that the company simply needs to look after its workers and the communities around them. The GAStech empire owns 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its company farms, runs gyms, and offers subsidised holidays in Black Sea resorts for key employees. GAStech certainly strives to ensure its employees can move in and out of these locations by operating a private fleet of four planes to ferry its staff the huge distances between sites.

The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis.  A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a cafÿ¿¿¿¿¿here you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations.

NOTE: This article is the second in a series, reprinted with permission from the Homeland Illumination.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. 
 "We've worked the land for a long time - maybe 200 years, maybe a bit more," Henk Bodrogi told me as he picked over a container of bolts, searching for the right size.  It took a while to figure out, then one of the city officers figured out to call in a water specialist.  When they tested it they said the water was contaminated." 

The water specialist turned out to be the international agency "Wellness For All", an international agency with a mission to bring healthy water to communities distressed by natural disasters, draught and - coincidentally - oil and gas development. Reynolds agreed to speak to me for a few minutes between meetings about their work in Elodis.  The Elodis drinking water comes from the Tiskele River, as does all the water for farming, so we looked for a source upstream.  The toxins are forming a subsurface plume that seeps into the Tiskele River from which the residents of Elodis draw their drinking water and irrigation for the crops." 

"When we didn't make headway with GAStech," Reynolds continued, "the community leaders decided to approach the government of Kronos for assistance.   Per our policy -and with permission from the Elodis leaders - we published the test results in an official public document.  The Elodis leaders then approached the government officials as citizens of a Kronesian community armed with the scientific analysis.

Traffic snarled around the city as Abilians struggle to get to work amid vandalism and looting.

Early on Tuesday police stormed the front of the presidential mansion and the capital building, breaking up a sit in by the Protectors of Kronos.  

Later in the day, what had been a largely peaceful demonstration turned violent when the crowd started vandalizing government buildings and the presidential homestead.  

Police reinforcements were sent to the area and blocked roads, and skirmishes between the police and protestors broke out.

Demonstrating his trademark humor, Karel lifted his wrists and joked to his supporters as he is led away, "I guess I shouldn't have sent the President those cases of bottled water for his birthday." 

Karel is the leader of the Protectors of Kronos, an alliance of Kronos citizens from Elodis that has demanded the government clean up the contaminated water caused by gas drilling in their community.  I ask:  Where is the money going?

The police representative assured supporters who massed outside the police station that Karel would be treated humanely, but declined to answer questions or allow visitors to see Karel.

The world of gas is distant, difficult and far flung. In Tethys a few years ago, I journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of Tethys to look at a contentious new energy producing area. 

One of the sites I visited was a local office of the Sanjorge Gas company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation. 

But I'd forgotten about the encounter until I went back to Tethys the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: one man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it. Something very significant has happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas industry expertise. The city has taken the temporary boon of energy on its doorstep, and turned it into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which may make Centrum a centre of gas expertise long after the gas itself runs out.

I've asked him to tell me about the involvement of the government of Kronos in the deeply troubling account of a community's struggle for protection from those who should help them the most: their elected officials, against those who would poison their children and the country's food.  He called every department that could possibly be associated with our problem:  interior, justice, foreign affairs, health. 

Reese then describes months of meetings at which the government officials demanded documents proving their case:  health and crop yield statistics, the scientific test results from Wellness For All, and medical records.

Kronos' oil and gas industry has warned it faces its "biggest challenge in 20 years" due to the low levels of exploration. 

"Kronos' fields contain an abundance of oil and gas yet to be found and it is critical we find the means to turn the current state of exploration around" -Energy Minister Jules Jecovic 

The annual activity survey by Oil and Gas Kronos found a rapid increase in production costs, up by 15% last year. 

Following the rapid decline in oil and gas production from Kronos fields in recent years, the rate of fall slowed during 2012 - down by 8% to .83m barrels of oil per day, or its gas equivalent.

TITLE: SPONTANEOUS PROTESTS ERUPT AROUND ABILA

PUBLISHED: 20 June 2009

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

Protests erupted around the Kronos government buildings, downtown, and elsewhere around Abila eventually escalating into riots and violence. 

The activists are protesting the death yesterday of Elian Karel, a Protector of Kronos (POK) activist who died in jail after being arrested for tax evasion. However, the protests have turned violent with smashed windows and vandalized shops.

Countless shop windows smashed in and around Siopa, the downtown shopping area. A general sense of chaos broke out with chanting protesters, fires, and fleeing citizens. 

A unifying theme of the protesters was the chanted slogans including "Justice for Elian" in reference to previously mentioned activist Elian Karel and "Remember Juliana", a young girl from Elodis who died in 1998 allegedly from the effects of water contamination. Several buildings were defaced with the above mentioned slogans as well.

The Kronos government issued a statement, "This sort of violence will not be condoned. Destruction and violence is no way to achieve peace and change - these things are in opposition to each other. The Protectors of Kronos must resume peaceful means; all other approaches are unjustifiable."

Letters purported to be from the Protectors of Kronos (POK) have been received by Vincent Kapelou, Minister of Health and nephew of President Kapelou. The threatening letters appear to be the empty threats of an attention-seeking organization and nothing more.

Mr. Kapelou said, "Chances are this is nothing, but we're not going to take any chances." Nonetheless he has doubled the size of his personal security force in response to the letters.

These sorts of threats only reinforce the fact that the POK are a "public threat" to quote President Kapelou.

After continued complaints and appeals from the people of Elodis government officials acknowledge minor contamination in and around the rural township in a report on their investigation into the townspeople's health issues. However, the government report stops short of blaming GAStech International and its Tiskele Bend site 20 km upstream as the people of Elodis assert. 

The government report cites no root cause or causes can be determined at this time with more research and investigations needed. Indeed, "pointing a finger of blame at this time would be hasty and most likely detrimental to the investigation."

Though the report admits some contamination it goes on the qualify the level stating, "The minor level of contamination is well within international health standards agreed upon by the Government of Kronos and GAStech International as negotiated in the Tiskele Bend site contract."

The Government of Kronos continues to offer well testing for concerned residents of Elodis as well as plans to further investigate the root causes of the illnesses in and around the township.

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

A long tense day of conflicting reports and confusing information has come to an end. What we know for certain is that 14 GAStech employees are not only missing, but kidnapped as confirmed by a Kronos Government source. At this time it is unclear who the missing are and whether they are citizens of Kronos of Tethys, as many GAStech employees are Tethan.

There is still speculation regarding who was taken in the kidnapping and whether GAStech President and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. was the target, given that GAStech International has yet to make a statement to the press. Speculation about the motives of the kidnappers has been rampant due to the recent news of the GAStech Initial Public Offering only a month ago.

At this time no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. Edvard Vann, a GAStech - Kronos security guard who was interrogated and released after 6 hours, gave the indication that the Protectors of Kronos were involved or at least suspected as being the perpetrators behind today's events.

A GAStech International senior security executive has been on site to support the investigation aiding the Abila Police Department and Kronos Government officials.

January 20th was GAStech's annual corporate meeting with a Kronos Government reception to follow. Shortly after the morning meeting ended at 10:00, Abila Fire Department trucks responded to reports of a fire at the GAStech office.

Vann was visibly angry about the confusion, which apparently stemmed from the similarity of his name and known members of the Protectors of Kronos.
Vann said he was "instructed not to communicate with the press, but I feel I have to stress my innocence. I have nothing to do whatsoever with any members of the terrorist group POK."`,source:"The Abila Post",title:"ON THE SCENE BLOG",date:null,location:null,cluster:50,topic:"0_kronos_protesters_protests_protestors",text_length:671},{id:"./data/News Articles/The Abila Post/439.txt",path:"The Abila Post/439.txt",pathList:["The Abila Post","439.txt"],name:"439.txt",text:`SOURCE: The Abila Post
TITLE: ELODIS PROTESTS TURN TO RIOTS AND ARRESTS 

PUBLISHED: 24 September 2005

LOCATION: ELODIS, Kronos 

The Protectors of Kronos (POK) continue to protest against the Kronos Government and GAStech International alleging pollution, water contamination and a lack of a government response. Lately the protests have turned violent escalating into rioting largely directed at the Tiskele Bend site.

The latest event involved POK protesters forming a human chain to block the entrance of GAStech's Tiskele Bend site. After the recent rioting, government officials had no choice, but to round up the protesters and arrest them for trespassing.

Government spokesman Rufus Drymiau commented, "These sort of violent actions by members of the Protectors of Kronos are counterproductive. We are working closely - the government and GAStech - to ensure that all environmental issues are resolved."

Several instances of rioting in and around Elodis have been reported including the trashing of government buildings, rock throwing, and tire burnings. Police have responded swiftly and decisively. The various skirmishes with police have ended in arrests.

PUBLISHED: 20 June 2010 

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

Protesters aligned with the Protectors of Kronos (POK) activist group surrounded government buildings chanting and carry images of their so-called martyrs. Kronos government security forces in concert with Abila police suppressed the protest with an impressive show of force.

Dressed in black the authorities donning helmets and gasmasks and brandishing riot shields, fired tear gas canisters as the protesters refused to disperse after several warnings. The group gathered proved reluctant to disperse even after the tear gas and the authorities pressed into the group protecting themselves with their shields and freely swinging their batons.

In the face of overwhelming force, most of the protesters fled; however, a hard core group stood their ground suffering the consequences. The remaining protesters were surrounded by the riot police and after repeated baton blows many were dragged away under arrest. 

When the smoke cleared amongst the discarded and trampled banners and signs, blood was clearly visible on the plaza.

PUBLISHED: 20 January 2014

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

For roughly 6 hours GAStech - Kronos employee Edvard Vann was interrogated by Kronos Police and Government officials before being released at 17:00 this evening. The apparent confusion stems from the similarity between his name and that of a Protector of Kronos member.

Vann, a security guard for GAStech, was furious, stating, "I have nothing to do whatsoever with any members of the terrorist group POK. I know no one from Elodis. I was born here in Abila and I support my government and my president. Being accused and being interrogated for 6 hours as a terrorist POK member is one of the worst days of my life. Just because a person has the same name as a criminal does not make him a criminal."

Though he was instructed not to communicate with the press Vann was adamant to stress his innocence. With some 14 GAStech employees still unaccounted for, one cannot blame the police or the government for not leaving any stone unturned.

TITLE: WHO ARE THE PROTESTERS 

PUBLISHED: 22 August 2012 

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

With the third anniversary of Elian Karel's death approaching - former member of the Protectors of Kronos - the question is: who are the protesters? But not only who are they, what and why are they protesting? 

The Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis on the advice of the now defunct Wellness for All (WFA), an international water safety group. The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts that GAStech International's Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis. 

In 1998, WFA performed testing on the water of Elodis finding high levels of benzene, toluene and xylene arsenic, barium, chromium, lead and selenium. The testing a subsequent statement released by WFA brought international attention and pressure on the government and GAStech to act. However, with the fragmenting of WFA due to funding issues, the POK's demands were largely ignored and downplayed. 

Also in 1998, Juliana Vann, a previously healthy ten-year old girl died of a lingering illness, which WFA-funded doctors claimed was caused by water contamination. The Government of Kronos officially refuted the claim citing the fragmentation of the WFA organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted. Regardless, Juliana became the POK's first martyr and has used Juliana's image on campaign literature ever since. 

The POK's second major martyr is Elian Karel, who died in 2009 while incarcerated of undetermined causes. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion. Karel had been involved with the POK since its inception given that his father, Jeroen Karel, was an original member.  Elian Karel's death in 2009 was marked by spontaneous instances of protest around Abila. The anniversary of his death, June 19, has seen additional protests, demonstrations, riots, and violence. 

The POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people. As of 2011, the Government of Kronos has labeled the POK as a "public threat".

1732 UPDATE - Much of the information gathered from the GAStech employees who have been allowed to leave by police investigators point to a kidnapping of several GAStech employees. However, officials still have not confirmed a kidnapping has taken place. The number of missing employees is undetermined at this time given the earlier confusion with the false fire alarm.

There is some indication that the Protectors of Kronos - an activist group responsible for many recent demonstrations and riots in and around Abila - are suspected of being responsible for the kidnapping.

TITLE: DRUG RELATED ARRESTS ON THE RISE
 
PUBLISHED: 14 May 2011

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

An alarming new trend is sweeping Abila. Police point out a dramatic increase in drug related arrests that may be linked to violent activist groups. 

The port of Abila is known to be a transshipment point for drugs coming from the Middle East and Africa going to Europe namely heroin and hashish. However, drug related arrests had remained flat over the past decade until the recent increase. 

The concerns over the increase of drug related arrests are two-fold: first, violent activist groups such as the Protectors of Kronos could be using drug sales as a means to fund their activities; and second, with more drugs appearing on the shore, the people of Kronos will suffer increased drug related issues, namely addiction and violence.

LOCATION: ELODIS, Kronos 

The international healthy water awareness group Wellness for All (WFA) have performed testing on the local water in Elodis finding high level of hazardous materials in residential water wells. 

In a statement released by WFA, the group directs blame to the Government of Kronos and GAStech International, a natural gas company from Tethys. In addition to directing blame WFA also demands that the two clean up the contamination, which includes high levels of benzene, toluene and xylene arsenic, barium, chromium, lead and selenium.

By bringing attention to the contamination in and around Elodis, WFA expects the international community will pressure the Government of Kronos into action. Additionally, WFA has been working with the activist group Protectors of Kronos to lobby the government to apply pressure.

TITLE: TISKELE BEND EXPLOSION AND FIRE

PUBLISHED: 16 August 2000

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

A spark at the GAStech International-owned well at the Tiskele Bend site ignited methane gas several hundred feet underground, causing a fireball and fire that burned for about an hour is the findings from a dual GAStech - government investigation of the explosion and subsequent fire Sunday morning. 

Four GAStech employees suffered injuries including minor burns and broken bones. In contrast to previous reports there were no deaths and none missing as a result of the incident. No local residents were injured as well and though some residents of Elodis were evacuated from their homes the investigation indicates that the evacuation was unnecessary. 

While the official cause of the explosion is still under investigation, the problem may have come from a defect in the wellhead itself. GAStech's wellheads are ringed with collars that have set pins running through them. One of the pins may have blown out of the collar, releasing the gas, which then came in contact with a spark.

The Kronos Government has labeled the Protectors of Kronos (POK) as a threat to the public. In a statement by government spokesman Rufus Drymiau the POK are described as "justifiably a public threat due to violent demonstrations, opportunistic vandalism, and clashes with the police."

A shop owner in the Siopa district, who declined to be named, responded to the government labeling the POK a public threat: "I agree they are a public threat. Every time they come around they bring their signs and then they smash windows. We try to fight, but there are too many and they steal our things. My business suffers because of the Protectors."

Officer Emilio Haber, who patrols the Siopa district, said of the POK, "They smash the windows. They throw the rocks. They chant for change and paint things on buildings. They make themselves look stupid and then we arrest them and put them in jail where they belong."

Miriam Avila, an administrative assistant at GAStech International, has confirmed that members of the GAStech leadership are in fact missing. The group was expected to arrive at the Government reception following this morning's meeting at GAStech - Kronos headquarters, but never showed up.

Ms. Avila denied that any GAStech employee has been abducted. She also denied that they had simply skipped town with their newfound riches.

As The World reported on 16 December 2013, GAStech International's recent initial public offering (IPO) netted Sten Sanjorge, Jr. an eye-popping $1.96 billion for his controlling share of the international gas drilling and exploration company. 

The GAStech - Kronos leadership was also handsomely rewarded. The IPO filings show that the executive group earned a collective $327.25 million from the newly vested shares including $96.25 million each for CFO Ingrid Barranco, CIO Ada Campo-Corrente, and COO Orhan Strum. Environmental Safety Advisor Willem Vasco-Pais also earned $38.5 million.

Though Mr. Sanjorge, Jr. maintains an office in Centrum, the capital of Tethys, most of GAStech International's operations take place on Kronos including production of about 5 million cubic meters of gas daily. Ms. Avila works in GAStech's Centrum headquarters.

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

Abila Airport fueler Ravi Danisliau confirmed that two private jets took off today after being fueled. 

According to Danisliau, the seven or eight passengers of the first plane were "business types" and appeared to be in a hurry. It was not exactly clear where they were headed. The plane took off around 12:30 local Kronos time. 

The second plane also carried seven or eight "business types", but seemed "much more relaxed than the first group of passengers". Danisliau said the second group of passengers "seemed to be celebrating something." The second plane departed around 14:30 around two hours after the first plane.

Danisliau confirmed that the second plane's destination was Rome, Italy.

Between the two private jets that departed the Abila Airport fourteen to sixteen people could have been passengers. This could easily account for the leadership of GAStech - Kronos. 

When asked whether or not the two planes had anything to do with GAStech International Danisliau replied, "I don't ask a lot questions. I just fuel the planes."

PUBLISHED: 19 February 2009

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

A POK rally designed to bring attention to claims of environmental damage have done more damage to their image. The rally outside of GAStech International's headquarters resulted in multiple arrests for trespassing.

About two hundred people gathered in front of the GAStech building chanting slogans and waving signs that held the visages of people who have allegedly died due to environmental contamination.  Ten of the protestors chained themselves to the doors of the building in an attempt to prevent GAStech employees from going to work.

Police spokesman Adrien Carman said, "We allowed the group some latitude with their rally, but when GAStech complained that the protestors were blocking entrance to their building, we had to take action.  The last thing we wanted to happen was for a GAStech employee to get hurt by the crowd just because he was trying to go to work."

Government officials have expressed concern for the "pattern of increasingly aggressive tactics by the Protectors of Kronos." In response to increased aggression from the POK, additional security will be provided to ensure public safety for all future rallies.

GAStech officials declined to comment at this time indicating an official statement will be issued on the incident.

Last year spontaneous protests and riots broke out around Abila in response to the death of Elian Karel, a Protectors of Kronos (POK) activist. Officials fear a repeat of last year's violent activities around the city on the upcoming anniversary of Karel's death on June 19. 

Government officials issued a brief statement assuring the people of Abila that their "safety is of the utmost importance. Go about your business as usual. Groups like the Protectors of Kronos operate by fear, attempting to change lives and government through fear. Your government will not back down to fear-mongering."

The brief government statement ended there with a promise not to back down to protesters, if there are indeed protests. Hagar Awelon, a shop-owner in Siopa district of Abila heavily impacted by last year's events, responded to the government statement: "They [Government of Kronos] must do more than they did last year. My windows were smashed, my goods destroyed or stolen, and my son was attacked when he defended the store. They must do more."

The patients end up to Abila commonly by the larger town area, and they include adults and young people, male and female, and all socioe-economic contexts, aforesaid Bianca.

Sgt Antonio Arresta of the section of the fire Abila, first answering machine a question in the city, medical to emergency situation, said its department also an ear in the number of people has seen that treatment for complications of designer drugs has. We went of zero question to hand-full question in previous month, he said.

Bianca and Arresta said their efforts treat people are provided more with difficulty because they do not know frequently no matter what concerning the designer drugs that were taken.

YOU know what you when you get it, do not get aforesaid Bianca. We have patients come in have and uncontrolled act, who are very violent. They tell our they cotton suikergoed have done or synthetic marihuana.

There aforesaid Bianca little has been clinically obeyed concerning of cotton candy, since it is a new toxic substance. There are no checked studies in toxicology, she said. The national poison center collect anecdotal reports concerning overdoses of the hospitals and other suppliers as part of efforts to offer Council on how at to treat patients.

The drugs of the designer are chemical compositions which are composed to seem on the active ingredient in frequently illegitimate drugs. Cotton candy bootst the drug after line, a stimulant. The manufacturers frequently change the chemical composition of the designer drug and are name one step for authorities remain, aforesaid Biance. It is another manner sell it, she said.

Term cotton candy, for example, is a nickname of the drug and has to do nothing with carnival treats. The drug has been sold under the name of the dreams of the herb one yielded and under the name of the Blossom of the Tulip next. 

The government has placed Kronos three of the commonly use chemical products in the realization of cotton candy on its checked substance list and labelling as a crime their use and has. Still, the government cannot prohibit cotton candy entirely because the manufacturers can the recipe change and the law, aforesaid Bianca to limit. The drugs are sold online as  therapy products and are available concerning the meter in area rise.

We know still what with cotton candy does not get you. The chemical composition varies of parcel to parcel, aforesaid Bianca.

One factor for the popularity of cotton candy is low costs, aforesaid Bianca be. She said a gram cotton sugar well costs concerning K18 whereas a gram cocaine costs K166.

An altitude to euphoria, or, which right is or larger than that of, leads cotton candy cocaine but also a discharge causes which is worse, aforesaid Bianca. The disadvantageous impact of discharge causes frequently people to binge on cotton candy to the point where they consume the drug for days. They hanker to, she said.

After repeated use, the drug Courts roasted the brain of a person, who the chemical products descend those are transactions in balance bring. This leads sometimes to bizarre, frequently psychotic behavior that in the media, such as the case of the naked man in Elodis who was found it in the middle of of important gone has been reducing communicated, aforesaid Bianca. The seizure and the imagining ideas are incredibly, she said.

Whereas it is not yet stipulated who is behind the distribution of this round of designer drugs, the police force pursues suspect organized crime this large income source. The army of people is Asterian traditional implicated with drug trafficking by the area, and the maintaining agencies researches near possible cooperation between drug trafficking organizations and political rebellious groups.

TITLE: The insight of an expert: thriving as foreign CEO in Kronos 

PUBLISHED: 2014/03/26
17 January 1995



The strict Fluss are CEO of GAStech, the important industry of Krono more than 15 years, after its discovery of its immense gasvelden near the city of Elodis.

Fluss, have worked with dozens of foreign CEOs in the course of the years. However, he has records beginning as oil and gasprospector in Tethys. 

He spoke to The Times concerning the appetites of a successful LEADER in Kronos and which foreign CEOs in the market can expect. 

Q: What is possible foreign CEOs when they to Kronos expects come?

A: The economic environment has changed for the eighties. It is succeed much today more with difficulty. Foreign need CEOs their minimize expectations. There are easily none wins in Kronos. The competition under Kronosian and foreign firms is tough. It is difficult the harten and win the opinions of the population.

But there is less difference than people between culture Kronosian think and, culture says Tethian. The staff work of Kronos like only hard, is they respectful of their work and has same the wish for success. They know also it how at to appreciate efficient communication and a gifted LEADER.

What a foreign LEADER must do is learns how at to communicate Kronosian to the manner and time to demand to understand their staff.

Q: Can you develop?

A: There are a lot of cultural differences in communicating. [Think] after memoranda. Foreign CEOs have been always confused and frustrated when they send a memorandum [to someone in Kronos] and simple yes/no expect answer. In place of it they become a very long answer to that their initial question does not answer.

People of Kronos love the no responsibility to take. They are do be scared to lose their job and do not love in saying something are forced they to wants. Foreign need CEOs this take into account and the time to have demand to understand how at to communicate.

Patience is very important. Transparency can be an excellent get manner around this. It is a European value that Kronosians to very receptive is. Imposing in a company can turn foreign CEO into the travel in Kronos a more pleasant experience.

Q: What are the most important challenges foreign CEO can on arrival in Kronos under eyes see?

ri

A: Sometimes it is the simple things that can be the challenge, such as getting A to B in a taxi. Are able round to be easily taken for granted and cannot do creërt this a large meaning of uncertainty. In Kronos are you never certainly as your driver you on the planned address sale. This is possible if a small question seems but on a daily basis it is very tiring.

Another get to know your team and which you work with. Frequently foreign CEOs right to walk of the plane and in an office peak of employees Kronos. They have no idea that they are, how they work or how qualified they are. This can be confusing. 

The need of CEOs demand the time to speak for their staff, of the administrators for the truck drivers and their new environment to understand before they try and them lead.

Q: Can you give a couple ends on how foreign CEO can preparations make?

A: The first thing which I am your prepare family would say. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new work surroundings. This can influence it personal life. Mixing family and the work is here very common practice. People of Kronos work overtime and socializing with their colleagues it is very differing from Tethys where there is a clear border between the work and family.

Foreign CEOs also must realize how tough are the competition and how much hard work must be introduced to succeed -- frequently much more than in their birth country. The language is a large question.

[But] no question how much you prepare, real experience will surprise in Kronos to work and live you always.

Q: How difficult - or easy - is it for foreign CEO in Kronos to be?

A: Generally, think I am CEO hard am. There is a lot very, is the environment tough and it is difficult find a balance with your personal life.

When a team hears Kronos that CEO come assume from overseas she is it a problem. But culturally they have no question with aliens. 

Q: There are situations in which it are a foreign staff employee in fact an advantage is?

A: This question depends really on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and culture. If they make no effort then to localize is it a net disadvantage. But in certain negotiations or certain questions such as luxury goods, foreign CEOs can be an advantage. They can bring to a another view, the process to facilitate.

Sometimes foreign CEO better knowledge of the industry have and can access to markets overseas bring. This can be real assets.

TITLE: GAStech 

PUBLISHED: 2013/02/24


It is the largest company in Kronos, the third largest gas company on the planet, and it is fifty-three years old. In the past it has had a reputation corrupt and ecologically detrimental, but nowadays tries GAStech, former tethys-only the matter, to deserve the confidence of international investors. This forms part of its ambitions to be advantageous extend matter which the Mediterranean area provides to gas.

It is mount-upward task, and there no certainty that Gastech have to the capacity potential investors it to be persuade manners, has repaired and in the eco-hostile past carrot has been no longer shot.

The pipeline far directions of GAStech have been based in Eastern Kronos, and are dense proportion with the government Kronosian. This is the heart of the pipeline matter of Kronos, where the gas of the Eastern gas fields fails it by conducted west to the rest of Kronos, Tethys and Europe is.

GAStech pump more than only gas. It has to cities and conducted for its transactions cities to maintain, which it leads and almost single-handed in functioning put.

The head of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, of which photograph recognizes of calendars and picture frameworks everywhere in the country tail, stands within a state charges, but debates that the company simply after its workers and communities must look around them.

Of course, to people good reasons necessary in the hostile distant areas come and have worked Kronosian. They become to provide with medical care, recreation, and food. The empire GAStech has 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its company agriculture companies, runs gyms, and offers to subsidized holiday in the resort of the black sea for very important employees. For staff employees, it puts an overview, marble-lined a medical and therapy center in functioning.

Beside each of these perks, is there also posts of TV GAStech, which claims be not even unbiased. It must serve the will of the company there.

The picture of a modern overall company hardly seems, since the most of those unceremoniously have dumped their not fundamental activities. There is an argument, however, which the energy matter differing from other industries be, which energy companies require to work in several manners.

Working in far from place without previous oil and the gas places of infrastructure resources always, to some extend, company cities will be. GAStech strive themselves certainly insure be employees and from these places by a private fleet of four planes to ferry boat in functioning to put be staff the giant distances between places can move.

TITLE: The gas pioneer of the shale plant the first sea wells of the world in Mediterranean sea 



PUBLISHED: 1984/05/05


L<<Deleted picture: Protester.  The exploration has proved a controversial question in Kronos>>

Most important tale remains the reading	

The sonof the founder of gas fixed GAStech has been learned bore a venture of plan in the Mediterranean sea, has The Times.

Sten Sanjorge, Jr. believe there large volumes of gas are that could be obtained.

Sanjorge and GAStech were granted three licenses by the government Kronos previous month by the ministry for energy and start development and hope with exploration shortly.

The certain gas are no new concept, but there are not no reason The Times told with the history Kronosian of sea development that we these resources can develop for the coast, he.

he gas of the shale is obtained the using controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate disposal which involves injecting acidic the layers of the chemical productenschalie, to break them apart and within gas locked up it rather to give.

Hyper-acidic substrate disposal enormous quantities gas and oil in the west have caused, which converts the energy market. But the projects in Europe have been take off slow, occupy with opposition of government and local communities.

Sanjorge say it a short time will be before we knowing or are possible the shale gas become exploitable.

A lot of environment experts believe that hyper-acidic substrate disposal can marine damage themselves environments, and the avulsion of new fossile fuel resources resists himself. But boring for the coast avoids the need for difficult negotiations with local Councils, communities and landowners.

Based on existing geological data, SanJorge that believe a considerable quantity gas at its place - until 100 trillion cubic foot are, which would be more than the estimates of GAStech for its coast resources. There is also the possibility of finding oil.

GAStech that has valued Kronos the total sea resources of the shale gas between five 10 times the size of resources available coast could be.

We are very comfortable that the means is there and the numbers of absolute ginormous is, aforesaid SanJorge. Is no matter which of that workable? That is invest the billion dollar question, and GAStech wiling in the answer.

Although it has become only recently controversial, hyper-acidic substrate disposal have been used on small-scale a lot of years, to improve conventional oil and gas well to the flow of. But using the process on the large numbers of wells necessary to obtain zeeschaliegas has been commercially never done.

Professor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical concerning or to the shale gas a large employee to European energy in the next decade could be, but will say that potentially was possible in the longer term have.

GAStech are optimistic are its estimates of how long it will last to examine shale. It is completely plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, hyper-acidic will have this way progressed the technology of the substrate disposal and the manner in which we treat the sea environment this way will have progressed that this the really large industry could be. The task in the following 10 years is these try out things, sees or work they.

TITLE: The central role of the center in industry of the gas Tethan 

PUBLISHED: 1982/10/03

The world of gas has been thrown far, with difficulty and far. Suffered in Tethys a couple year, I traveled with difficulty to the distant gas fields of Tethys to examine causing area a controversial new energy.

An one of the places which I was room office of the Sanjorge company of the gas has visited, being stuffed which reinforced the work boots and overall and the chemical products and the supply with you must put gas processing in functioning. Since I remind it, a former truck driver was responsible.

It was a living example of how an once small exploration company of Thethys in a powerful international strength in the energy industry had started grow.

But I had had concerning the meeting have to forgotten to I to Tethys the other day for the first time for their early years, to reacquaint with the man who the matter created, Sten Sanjorge returned: one people (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) that by the whole tale of gas searching to floor treasures have lived and of thrived strongly.

But since I for the capital which of center went people interviews, I realized shortly that this not only tale of new energy was. Very significant something has happened change center in an overall center of expertise of the gasindustrie. Of what becomes in the capital is developed there important lessons for other places holy (and are cursed which) with abundant natural wealth.

The center developed expertise of world class concerning technique in very difficult surroundings

Then I young newspaperman on the daily report in Glasgow in the early seventies were, started the large for the coast oil spill in the North sea. Then a rather impossible dream, which an island changes of coal in a place with abundant oil and gas delivery, seemed.

It seemed to our on the west coast of shot country that the much thrown city of center, Tethys a bit for its boots large got, believe which in the new fantasy industry start.

Much to the spite of its mother, in the meantime, Sten Sanjorge was to floor treasures zoeken in the early sixties started.

By the early seventies, a new gas company, GAStech started, with its progress.

Under its cautious accompaniment, GAStech in an important supplier of gas to the local area evolved, and then much further far gone. It has now thousands employees and works in many countries. 

The change in center has been considerable.  YOU notice them in the constant cheap goods of helicopters coming and going to remote areas, and the planes which are alternatively established at the airport of the city to shuttle execs of the city.

And since you float for center, each round trip is almost sponsored by a department of GAStech. 

Sanjorge have recently started more attention to free time activities and philanthropy to spend, which is Fluss strict permits of Sten Jr. and of the cofounder put the company in functioning. But Sanjorge have been asked net submit a report for the government Tethan which to look recommends the best manners that Tethys energy for decades continue cause to come.

Easy-to-get material have been produced, so that loving the gas will demand next much investment and nicer new techniques, such as hyper-acidic the techniques of the substrate disposal which are developed by the company in 1974. 

This way thanks to nice people such as Sten Sanjorge and people whom with him work, the center has reached what each place where the raw materials lung are discovered to do. The city has taken the temporary blessing of energy on its threshold, and it changed in specialized knowledge and intellectual property which can a center of long hospitality  turn into center after the gas himself runs from.

The disorder started in former days in Abila in the week, with protests concerning the dismissal of different employees Kronosian of energy giant international GAStech.  GAStech have its carrots in Tethys, although a lot of directors in Kronos live.

This seems be a case of simmering frustration concerning ebullient.

The policy is support highest of GAStech and is tax income to the government trunks - seems still any squat ignore questions but is own above the average pays parcels.

The environment situation is desperate. Hundreds rural citizens suffer from important sicknesses which are apparently caused by exhibition to GAStech waste streams, although this no official gesubstantiërd have been or recognize by or the company or government. 

That is what the initial protests in Abila sparked - but empathy with their cause brought out demonstration systems in cities concerning Kronos.  Initially peaceful, this protest is more and more violent, and both the police force and the citizens is now caught in sometimes fatal cross fire.  

Kronos president Dorel Kapelou II such as he is saying cited a meeting of the highest control would call to aim the terrorist threat to peace in the country.

The dismantled streets, factories, storefronts tired, and the sad markets of the past go away potholed.  Abila of today is a city of the industry, of a place of the commerce and the investment, of a place of the opportunity and the success.  The prosperity has come to Kronos, and we are all the best ones for him.

Nevertheless, still there are those think incorrect that the prosperity is bad for us.  This people demand that the foreign investment is bad for our country, that is diluting our culture and that is mining our values.  She demands that the foreigners are exploding to us for their own increase and that our government causes that little he watches for the well-being of our people.  It is so militant in her incorrect-directed belief that it has made demands that the foreign companies are poisoning to our children with their technology.  It has even gone as far as to have brought in "foreign experts" who the demand "has our better interests in the heart" to help to separate its agenda against progress and the prosperity for our people.  Hipocrisy to bring in foreigners to say that to open our country to us in the foreigners he is bad for us is absurd and is obvious a sample of the mental disease in which they oppose our modernization.

A smaller number of families live in the black suburbs along a principal street with two markets, two stores of material, a gas station and a coffee where you can buy the lunch, take your mail and buy one liter of milk to bring the house.  The families lived in Elodis for generations.

"We made for a long time a good life," Reese says to me. "The population had firmly increased.  The vegetable production was good.  For the majority, the children did not leave for the city as they have in many of other rural places.  We have much ground which could still be developed. There was a future for them here."

I asked Reese to help me to meet the people whose lives were carried out by the operations of GAStech. It presented to me at a farmer whose family had been here for several generations.  

I caught up with myself compared to Henk Bodrogi downtown making of the purchases to the store of material of Osvaldo to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi cultivated soya its life whole, just as his/her father and their fathers. I questioned it about his life with the farm.

The thousands of protesters carrying of the banners reading "remember Juliana!" and singing "we want the truth!" gathered in front of Kronos of government of offices Saturday morning. The protesters required an accountancy of the incomes of government then tax tax incentives of the President Araullo' S which were signed in the law in 1993.

From ten years - old Juliana Vann died into 1998 of a disease caused by the soiled water of the operations of drilling of GAStech. It became the tearing icon of a movement which received the support of an end of Kronos to the other.

"We were promised best work, of new roads, better care of health and a better level the life," the aforementioned one 20 years - the old protestor who refused to make employ his name.  "All which I see are larger manors for the ministers and a hospital who cost the difficulty more than it can make.  We will not accept that!"

The protestor referred to the hospital general of Abila builds in 1997 seemingly with money of the increased income of the foreign gas operations here on Kronos.

TITLE: ELODIS, KRONOS:  HELP of an UNEXPECTED part two of SOURCE

PUBLISHED: 1998/04/27


This article is the second installment of a series in three parts addressing the problem growing of an anguish of the community, the embezzlement of government, and influences it alarming at the multinational multinationals on the country of Kronos.

I caught up with myself compared to Henk Bodrogi downtown making of the purchases to the ferro store of material to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi cultivated the soil his whole life, just as his father and their fathers. I questioned it about his life with the farm.

 "We worked the ground for a long time - perhaps 200 years, perhaps a little more," Henk Bodrogi like it indicated to me selected above a container of bolts, seeking the good size.  "During years we added a few hectares here and there.  It maintains occupied to us."

Occupied is an undervaluation, as I found when I stabbed the stiff farmer to say myself more.

"Of I head usually to the fields before the sun to the top," Mr. Henk Bodrogi indicates to me. "My wife obtains the high children and titrates to inform, then it will do something so that us eat for the lunch and function beside me until the dinner.  When the children become at the house of the school they make their drudgeries, and we are all backs at the house the majority of the times by the darkness."

"We make these majority of the days," it is added, "except days of worship."

Bodrogi identifies the suitable bolt and causes with the cash clerk about the children and of the school while it achieves his purchase.

"All let us know We here another," Bodrogi explains while we leave. "The majority of the families lived here for generations.  The first new people who came to the city were with this gas company which established the back of a few years."

I ask Bodrogi if the businesses were good. 

"We made very good until recently.  The benefit were good and we add cultivated surface, or improve the equipment.  Then we started to have all this trouble with harvests."

How, I asked.

"Harvests do not produce as they have in the past.  That removed one moment with the figure, then one of the leaders of city illustrated outside to call in a water specialist.  When they examined it they said that water was soiled."

Bodrodgi sighed, and with a glance encircled in its eye it thanked me for my interest and says had it to me to direct the back house.  The tractor had to be fixed before they could function the next day.  I thanked it and observed it rise in its truck and head out of the city.

The water specialist proved to be the international agency "health for all", an international agency with a mission to bring healthy water to the communities afflicted by normal disasters, outlines and - coincidentally - oil and formation of gas.

I caught up with myself compared to a representative of health for the whole the next day.  Joclyn Reynolds is a coordinator of project for "health for all".  It spoke to me above a satellite call its office field in South-East Asia where it was efforts of relief of establishment following an earthquake. Mrs. Reynolds agreed to speak to me during a few minutes between the meetings about their work in Elodis.

"We were contacted by a civil servant of city about a problem which they had with water their room.  In years of the last agriculture was effondue, and the incidence of certain diseases and defects of birth had gone up.  The drinking water of Elodis comes from the river of Tiskele, just as any water for the leasing, thus we sought a source upstream.  We found sources of provision of reject of production of operation of GAStech ascending.  The tests showed the high levels of benzene, toluene, the xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, between other toxins."

"Can these substances occur naturally?" I asked him.

"Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly.  The subsoil water contamination is usually the result of the human activity.  The pipes of GAStech discharge from the contaminants in a pond.  The toxins form a feather with ground flower which infiltrates in the river of Tiskele of which residents of the aspiration of Elodis their drinking water and irrigation for harvests."

"You spoke in GAStech on this subject?"

"OH yes," it answered.  "In the beginning we believed that we gain traction.  We met several times with representatives of GAStech, including one of the senior executive, Hank Fluss.  It personally ensured us that GAStech would act in a responsible way to provide to the material aid and financial worms of the efforts of cleaning.  After one moment, although, it appeared clearly that while Mr. Fluss was serious it was Sanjorge which makes the decisions.  It is obvious that it [Sanjorge] does not have any interest for the wellbeing of the residents of Elodis, or environment."

Sten Sanjorge Jr., which had inherited its share to the company of his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for pitiless procedures of management.

"When we did not make progress with GAStech," Reynolds continued, "the chiefs of the community decided to approach the government of Kronos for the assistance.   By our policy - and with the permission of the chiefs of Elodis - we published the test results in an official public document.  The chiefs of Elodis then approached the civils servant of government as citizens of a community of Kronesian armed with the scientific analysis.  Our agency ensured that we would be still available to help in some way when these agreements were completed. " 

In this moment Mrs. Reynolds was called part of the telephone, thus I returned to my friend of writer, Pondo Reese for saying to completion the history.

The part three will be published on May 15, 1998

Another eyewitness, farm Charley Normand of Elodis adds, "ouais, the types of POK asked the drivers to move well, but the drivers of GAStech were unaware of them.  They had their windows downwards, thus it was not as they could not hear them."

The occupants of the vehicles of government left and joined the argument.  The sequence of operations becomes muddling in this moment.  Some witnesses state the arguments incited by drivers of GAStech with the protestateurs, and others think that the civils servant of government started to make to violence the protesters of the road.

"Proves to be the people in the cars of government were police force," Mabel says.  "It carried uniforms and had badges."

The spectators say that the three parts started to howl, and at a certain point the police force of Kronos - probably of Abila- stopped the five activists and transported to a prison of Elodis.

In spite of the requests repeated for an interview, one did not grant access to those stopped.

The protest and others in and around Abila, the capital of Kronos, have been in response to alleged water contamination issues and a lack of Government and GAStech response.

Sten Sanjorge, Jr. declined to comment directly on questions regarding protests and environmental contamination. He deflected, "Today is a great day for GAStech. I won't let the day be derailed by unfounded, borderline libelous, allegations."

The real gross domestic product - the output of goods and services produced by labor and property located in Kronos - increased at an annual rate of 5.4% in the fourth quarter of 1999, according to the advance estimate released by the Bureau of Economics.

This marks the 5th year in a row with positive GDP growth for the developing country. Most of this growth can be contributed to the relationship between the Government of Kronos and GAStech International.

GAStech International has shifted its focus from Tethys to the small Mediterranean island of Kronos and the vast gas deposits beneath the ground.

Recent charges of groundwater contamination against GAStech International and tightening environmental regulations lead by the Tethan Interior Minister, Ivar Blanes, certainly play into the shifting focus. 

With environmental regulation lax to nonexistent in Kronos and a friendly local government, GAStech's move feels inevitable in hindsight.

TITLE: KIDNAPPING AT GASTECH KRONOS 

PUBLISHED: 20 January 2014

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

After a long day of conflicting and confusing information reports are still sketchy, but the story is beginning to come clear: a Kronos Government source has confirmed up to fourteen of GAStech International's employees may have been kidnapped at the company's headquarters in Abila. 

Much speculation remains regarding who was taken in the kidnapping. Speculation includes whether or not GAStech International President and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. was the target given that GAStech International has yet to make a statement to the press. Speculation about the motivation behind the kidnapping has also been rampant due to the recent GAStech IPO.

At this time no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. Edvard Vann, a GAStech - Kronos security guard who was interrogated and released after 6 hours, indicated the Protectors of Kronos were suspected as being the perpetrators behind today's events.

A GAStech International senior security executive has been on site to support the investigation, aiding the Abila Police Department and Kronos Government officials.

January 20th was GAStech's annual corporate meeting. At some point while company officers were transitioning from the main office to a Kronos Government reception the abductions took place. 

Unconfirmed reports of a fire at the office may have served as a distraction for the kidnappers or at least contributed to the confusion during the event. Abila Fire Department trucks were dispatched to GAStech - Kronos headquarters around 10:00 this morning local Kronos time to respond to a fire alarm.

An explosion at a nearby gas drilling well pad woke Rebecca Cato around 3 a.m. on Sunday morning. When she left her home in Elodis, Kronos - a rural township outside the capital Abila - to investigate the noise she noticed a large fire coming from GAStech International's Tiskele Bend site.

The GAStech-owned well near Elodis ignited methane gas underground causing a fire that lasted for around an hour. At least four GAStech employees appeared to have been taken away by ambulance; however, GAStech has declined to comment on the extent and nature of their injuries. 

GAStech's CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. downplayed the event stating, "This event could hardly be described as an explosion," but merely a common practice referred to as flaring. He continued, "I won't bore you with the details, but a temporary flare is often used during well production testing." 

Mrs. Cato and other locals from Elodis were turned away by GAStech employees and government officials. Eventually, locals downriver were evacuated. Rebecca Cato said, "After sending us away without a single question answered, they came to our doors and told us to leave our homes. It was the middle of the night where was I to go."

Hank Fluss spent 40 years with GAStech, befriending Sten Sanjorge, Sr. in 1963 when the two started out on their own. As wildcatters, they began drilling in areas not previously known to be gas fields. After many failed wells and on the brink of financial ruin, Fluss and Sanjorge, Sr. pressed on eventually finding one of the largest untapped gas fields in Tethys.

As Chief Operating Officer, Fluss has overseen GAStech's expansion, truly making it an international company and growing it into a multi-billion dollar operation. Always a champion of environmental causes, Fluss had become increasingly disenchanted with the GAStech - Kronos operation straining his relationship with CEO Sten Sanjorge, Jr. 

Hank Fluss is survived by his wife of 54 years, Beatriz Fluss, his 5 children, and 12 grandchildren.

PUBLISHED: 11 December 1992 

LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos 

The Government of Kronos is currently planning some of the world's most generous tax breaks for gas investments. This will help create "cheap energy" that can give the developing country a competitive advantage and a leg up in the government's push to modernize.

As high-income countries from Europe and the United States race to take advantage of existing and potential gas deposits, Kronos is planning to provide incentives such as reducing corporate and individual tax, preferential tariffs, and derogations from regulations as well as cheap, but eager work force.

The Government of Kronos is pitching the plan as a win-win situation given that the high-income countries will be struggling to discover and exploit ever-dwindling supplies of fossil-fuels and the developing Kronos needs income, infrastructure, and cheap energy.

Look for energy companies to flock to Kronos.

As part of the government brokered deal with GAStech International, Abila must make upgrades to their deep water port. When gas production ramps up, the Port's traffic is expected to increase ten-fold. 

The proposed upgrades include raising Abila's East Pier in phases, a massive $300 million project that will accommodate new, larger container ships. Currently the East Pier is roughly 3 meters above sea level and must be raised to 8 meters. Additionally, the Port will need to dredge the port killing two birds with one stone: increasing the depth of the port and providing fill to raise the East Pier.

Busy is a understatement, since I found then I the wiry farmer to tell me more.

 I usually up to the areas by sun, M. Henk Bodrogi tells me. My woman takes care of the children heading to school, then they little something for us for lunch will turn to eat and beside me into diner to work.  When the children recover house of school they pass their jobs, and we are all at the house the most of times dark.

We do this the most days, he adds, except worship days.

We all know each other it here, Bodrogi explain since we leave. The most of families have lived here for generations.  First new people who came to city were with that gas company built a couple year back. 

I ask Bodrogi if the matter has been well. 

We did to recently free good.  The profits were well and we add land, or promote material.  Then started we have all this problem with the plants.

On which manner, I asked.

The plants do not produce if they have in the past.  It took one while to calculate, then one of the town civil servants who are calculated to obtain a water specialist.  Then they tested it they said water was polluted.

Bodrodgi which are sighed, and with a besieged can in its eye he me for my interest thanked and he told had lead me behind to house.  The motor tractor had be confirmed before they the next day could work.  I thanked him and paid attention to him climb in its truck and head from city.

Ms. Reynolds came to me for a couple speak minutes between meetings concerning their work in Elodis.

We were contacted by a town civil servant concerning a problem they with their room water had.  In the last years agriculture had collapsed, and the by-effect of certain sicknesses and birth shortages had increased.  The drinking water Elodis comes from the river Tiskele, like already water for agriculture, so that upstream we searched a source.  We found sources of the disposal of the production detritus upstream at the GAStech operation. The tests showed high levels of benzene, toluene, xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, among other things toxin. 

Are possible substances these natural? 

Not in these amounts, and not this sudden.  The pollution of the groundwater is usually the result of human activity.  GAStech release polluting substances of a pond.  The toxin to form subsurface plucks which trickles in the river Tiskele of which the residents of Elodis their drinking water and irrigation for the plants to draw.

You spoke to GAStech concerning this?

Yes, she answered Oh.  We believed firstly we traction reached.  We met representatives GAStech, including one including the higher staff employees, several keren strict Fluss.  He insured our personal GAStech would act responsibly to assist material and financial to cleaning turn effort.  After a time, nevertheless, it became clear that whereas M. Fluss were serious the Sanjorge were those decisions take.  It is clear that he [Sanjorge] has no interest in the well-being of the residents of Elodis, or environment.

Sten Sanjorge, Jr., which had its share in the company of its father in 1990, a reputation for cutthroat company practices had developed.

Then we made no progress with GAStech, continuously Reynolds, the Community LEADERs decided for aid the government of Kronos to approach.   By our policy - and with authorization of the LEADERs Elodis - we published the test results in an officially public document.  The LEADERs Elodis approached then the government civil servants as citizens of a community Kronesian which is armed with the scientific analysis.

In its e-mail he described an once abundant area that now it is agitated by pollution, which solutions to a worsening problem wrestle to find.  I decided to examine.

After a couple harvests, we saw a fall in production.   We thought perhaps the only hiccup were, and improve the things would become.  Then the kids sick to be then started took we a harder can at what could changed be. 

The change proved to be international GAStech, an international company that by Sten Sanjorge Jr, business tycoon from Tethys in functioning are put.

With a population of 6500, the most of residents of Elodis one imagine oneself themselves and two-story live on small agriculture companies.  A smaller number of families lives in the municipality along a street with two markets, two hardware rises, one gaspost and a café where you buy lunch, can take your mail and a liter buys milk to house to bring.  The families have lived in Elodis for generations.

We have made a good for a long time living, Reese tell me. The population steadily have increased.  The production of the plant has been well.  Mainly, the young people have not left for the city since they have a lot in other rural places.  We have a lot country which could be still developed. There was a future here for them.

I asked Reese me to help people meet it of who life has been influenced by the transactions of GAStech.  He introduced me to a farmer of whom family had been here for different generations.

Do you know why it takes a scale with him with the supermarket?  It heard that the prices of foodstuffs in Abila are really high."

However, its capacity to engage in finally the government makes violence of Kronos had never been clear.  It is also not very clear which will take its coat in the POK now that it went.

TITLE: The race of boat stopped before starting 

PUBLISHED: 2010/03/05


10th Kapalou cup was given to later less than one hour before it was due to the beginning after the capsized presidential ship and is descended.

It is the first incident of its kind in the history of the famous race of boat of the world, in which the yachts of around the Mediterranean coast compete with for the gold cup coveted.

The presidential boat, had by the family of the President running Karel Kapelou II of Kronos, started to take water and slowly disappeared in the sea.

Before an assistance of the hundreds of spectators met in the point of Abila, to be used it as team-member was forced to jump in the life raft and to observe their ship go down until it was almost submerged.

The major part of being used as team-member entered the boats of delivery, whereas others which decided to swim with the shore described it as "cold".

Little time after the presidential ship was appreciably afflicted, a small boat of engine dispatched in the two directions between the boat and to undulate crowd of shore the "guards of Kronos" mark to comprise their white emblem of hand.  It is not known if the group were implied incident of boat, although the group is largely recognized like becoming increasingly violent in their protests against the government.

To be used as team-member refused to blame the captain of the boat, 41 years Petra Hohimae, which knows well about water in addition to littoral of Kronos.

One expects that the race is countermanded although there was no official word. Investigations at the presidential office were not answered.  

It is reported that to be used it as team-member suffers only from the minor damage during their abandonment and avoids the contact of pressure. One expects that the ball of official reception of cup of Kapalou is countermanded this evening, although many honorable and celebrities international remain in the country.

TITLE: The perspicacity of an expert: prosperity as foreign PRESIDENT in Kronos 

PUBLISHED: 2014/03/26
January 17, 1995

Hank Fluss is PRESIDENT of GAStech, the principal industry of Kronos during more than 15 years, after its discovery of its immense gas layers close to the town of Elodis.

Fluss, functioned with dozen foreign Presidents during years. However, it has humble beginnings as a gas and oil prospector in Tethys. 

It spoke at times about the features about a chief successful in Kronos and which foreign Presidents can envisage in the market. 

Q: What the foreign Presidents can they wait when they come in Kronos?

A: the economic environment changed since the Eighties. It is much more difficult to succeed today. The foreign Presidents must play in bottom of their hopes. There is no easy victory in Kronos. Competition among Kronosian and foreign companies is hard. It is difficult to gain the hearts and the spirits of the population.

But there is less of difference than people think between the culture of Kronosian and, culture of Tethian of word. The personnel of Kronos function just like hard, they are respectful of their work and have the same desire for success. They can also appreciate the effective communication and a gifted chief.

Which foreign chief must make is to learn how to communicate the "manner of Kronosian" and to take time to include/understand their personnel.

Q: Can you work out?

A: There are many cultural differences while communicating. [To consider] notes. The foreign Presidents are always confused and frustrated when they send a note [with somebody in Kronos] and expect a simple response of yes/No Instead of that they obtain a very long answer which does not answer their initial question.

The people of Kronos do not like to take the responsability. They are frightened to lose their work and do not like to be forced in saying something which they do not want with. The foreign Presidents must take account of this and have to take time to include/understand how to communicate.

Patience is key. Transparency can be an excellent manner of coming to end this. It is a European value which Kronosians are very sensitive to. To impose on a company can transform with the voyage of a foreign President into Kronos an experiment much more pleasant.

Q: What the challenges of force are they a foreign PRESIDENT can they face on the arrival in Kronos?



A: Sometimes in fact the simplest things can be most provocative, like going from A with B in a taxi. To be able to travel around easily is taken for granted and not being able to make thus creates a great direction of the insecurity. In Kronos you are never sure if your driver drops to you to far with the address envisaged. This can seem as a small question but daily it is very tiring.

Another ends up knowing your team and with which you work. Just often foreign of stage of Presidents in addition to plane and in an office completely of the colleagues of Kronos. They do not have any idea which they are, how they work or as they qualified are. This can be muddling. 

The Presidents must take time to speak with their personnel, of the administrators to the drivers of truck and to include/understand their new environment before they test them and control.

Q: Can you give some ends on the way in which a foreign PRESIDENT can prepare?

A: the first thing that I would say is to prepare your family. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new environment of operation. This can affect the personal life. The family and the work of mixture are practical very current here. The people of Kronos work of overtime and socializes with their colleagues. It is very different from Tethys where there is a clear border between work and the family.

The foreign Presidents should also carry out how hard competition is and how much hard work must be put inside to succeed -- often much more than in their countries of origin. The language is a great question.

[But] anyhow much prepare you, the true experiment to work and to live in Kronos will always astonish you.

Q: How much difficult - or easy - is it to be a foreign PRESIDENT in Kronos?

A: Generally, I think that being a PRESIDENT is hard. There is much pressure, the environment is hard and it is difficult to find a balance with your personal life.

When a team of Kronos hears them that a PRESIDENT comes from overseas suppose it is a problem. But, culturally they do not have a question with foreigners. 

Q: Are there situations in which to be a foreign director is really an advantage?

A: This question really depends on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and the culture. If they do not make any effort locate then it is a Net handicap. But in certain negotiations or certain questions such as the goods of luxury, the foreign Presidents can be an advantage. They can bring another point of view, facilitate the process.

Sometimes the foreign PRESIDENT with the best knowledge of an industry and can bring the access to the markets of overseas. This can be a tangible asset.

TITLE: Employees of GASTech removed in Kronos


PUBLISHED: 2014/01/21

Fourteen employees have fears removed in Kronos by a radical environmental group of terrorist during a meeting of corporation. 

One fears fourteen employees, probably including five executive leaders, removed yesterday by the "guards of Kronos".  Disappeared paid include: President and PRESIDENT Sten Sanjorge Jr, CFO Ingrid Barranco, CIO Ada Campo-Corrente, Orhan Strum, and environmental leader Willem Vasco-Pais.

The local organizations of news received a note of ransom of the claiming responsibility and to require POK $20 million the company.  They is possible additional requests are received.

TITLE: The central role of Centrum in the gas industry of Tethan 

PUBLISHED: 1982/10/04

The world of gas is distant, difficult and vast. In Tethys a few years ago, I travelled laboriously to the remote gas layers of Tethys to look at a new controversial sector of energy production.

One of the sites which I visited was a local office of the gas company of Sanjorge, lined initializations of work and reinforced combinations and the chemicals and the provisioning you must run a gas operation. As I remember it, a former truck-driver was responsible.

It was a sharp example in the way in which a company of exploration once small of Thethys had started to develop in a powerful international force in the industry of energy.

But I had forgotten the meeting until I would have gone again in Tethys the other day for the first time since their first years, with the reacquaint with the man who created the businesses, Sten Sanjorge: a man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) which lived by the whole history of prospecting gas and thrived strongly of him.

But while I went around the capital city of the interviewing people of Centrum, I realized soon that it was not simply a history of new energy. Something very significant A precisely proves to transform the centrum into total center of expertise of gas industry. Of what is developed in the capital city there are important lessons for other places blessed (and cursed) with the abundant natural resources.

"Centrum developed the expertise of class of the world while working in very difficult environments"

When I was a young journalist in Glasgow at the beginning of the Seventies, great oil precipitations at sea began North at sea. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, transforming a coal island into place with the abundant gas and oil provisioning.

It seemed with us on the Western coast of Scotland that the vast city of the Centrum, Tethys obtained with a little large for its initializations, starting to believe in new industry of imagination.

Much with the regrets of his/her mother, while waiting, Sten Sanjorge had begun the prospection at the beginning of the Sixties.

With the beginning of the Seventies, a new company of gas, GAStech, began the sound truck-like advances.

Under its careful councils, GAStech was transformed into an important supplier of natural gas to the local area, and then much further with far. It now has employees of thousands and functions in many countries. 

The change of the centrum was substantial.  You note them in the constant basic image of the helicopters to-ing and of fro-ing outside to the areas moved away, and had aligned them with the airport of the city to make the shuttle of the execs in the two directions of the city.

And while you lead around the centrum, almost each round not is financed by a division of GAStech. 

Sanjorge recently started to pay more attention to the activities of leisures and philanthropy, allowing Sten Jr. and Hank Fluss cofounder to direct the company. But Sanjorge was right guest to produce a report for the government of Tethan recommending the best manners of securing than Tethys continuous to produce energy during decades to come.

The substance easy-with-to obtain was produced, thus to keep to come from gas will need many investment and new more intelligent techniques, such as the techniques hyperacides of displacement of substrate developed by the company in 1974. 

Thus mercies with the intelligent people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, Centrum carried out what each place where raw materials are discovered wishes ardently to do. The city took the provisional advantage of energy on its threshold, and transformed into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which can return centrum a center of the long gas expertise after the gas itself becomes exhausted.

TITLE: GAStech

It is the largest company in Kronos, the third larger company of gas on planet, and they is years of fifty-three. In the past it had a reputation as corrupted and ambient harmful, but nowadays GAStech, the old businesses of Tethys-only, tries to gain the confidence of the international investors. This belonged to its ambitions to increase its gas of provisioning of profitable businesses apart from Mediterranean area.

It is ascending charge, and there is no certainty but Gastech with the capacity to convince the potential investors whom it repaired its manners, and is not enraciné any more in the eco-hostile past.

Operations of the drain of GAStech are based in Eastern Kronos, and there is close relationship with the government of Kronosian. It is the heart of the businesses of the drain of Kronos, where the gas of the Eastern gas layers is whistled in the west towards the remainder of Kronos, Tethys and Europe.

GAStech makes more than just gas of pump. It created cities and cities to maintain its operations, which it controls and runs almost simple-given.

The chief of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, whose photograph fixedly looks at outside calendars and executives of table everywhere in the country, recognizes "state the charges in state", but wire-drawer owing to the fact that the needs for company simply to deal of his workmen and the communities around them.

Naturally, to populate the good reasons of the need to come and work in the areas remotely hostile of Kronosian. They are equipped with medical care, entertainment, and food. The empire of GAStech has 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its farms of company, court of the rooms of gymnastics, and offers holidays subsidized in resources of the Black Sea for the principal employees. For executives, it runs a current situation, a medical center marble-striped and of therapy.

In addition to all these advantages, there is also the station of GAStech TV, which does not even pretend to be impartial. It is there to serve the will of the company.

This seems hardly the image of a modern total company, like the majority of those without ceremony emptied their "activities of not-core". There is an argument, however, that the businesses of energy are different from other industries, requiring companies of energy to function in the distinct ways.

By working in the distant places without average precedents infrastructure to oil and the gas sites will be always, to a certain extent, of the towns of company. GAStech tries certainly to ensure its employees can move in and out of these places by actuating a private fleet of four planes to transport out of vat its personnel the enormous distances between the sites.

The civils servant of energy of government declared that only 15 wells were drilled last year.

It was in spite of the strong levels of the investment, reaching one year last record and supported this year.

The structural test drilling was in fall of 26 wells six years ago, only sufficiently to recover a fraction of estimated oil and to poison remaining in the countries oil and of the gas layers.

The "fields of Kronos contain an abundance of oil and the gas to be still found and it is critical find us the means of turning the current state of the exploration around" - of the Minister for energy Jules Jecovic.

The annual investigation of activity per Oil and gas Kronos found last year an increase fast in production costs, to the top from 15%.

The average cost to extract a barrel from oil was in rise of 27% in only year, to reach K17.

The number of fields with the cost by barrel above K30 doubled in the last 12 months.

Increasing costs were quoted last week by GAStech, which considers future investments in Norway and North America, rather than the fields of Kronos.

With increasing costs, one expects that payments of taxes of production to the treasure of Kronos fall from K3.5bn during 2011-12 in K2bn per current year.

After the fast decline in the production of oil and gas starting from the fields of Kronos these last years, the rate of fall slowed down during 2012 - to the bottom of barrels of 8% with oil .83m per day, or its equivalents of gas.

The son of the founder of the gas company that GAStech projects a company to drill the Mediterranean sea inside, times learned.

Sten Sanjorge, Jr. believes that there are great volumes of gases at sea which could be extracted.

Sanjorge and GAStech were allotted to three licenses by the government of Kronos last month by the ministry for energy and the development and the hopes to begin exploration soon.

"The gas certainly at sea is not a new concept, but there is no reason with the history of Kronosian of the development at sea which we cannot develop these resources at sea," it said times.

The shale gas is extracted by using the technique discussed from hyperacide displacement from substrate which implies to inject acid layers of shale of chemicals, to break them to the top and to release natural gas imprisoned in inside.

Hyperacidic displacement of substrate produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the Westerner, transforming the market of energy. But the projects in Europe were slow to take off, attacked with the opposition of the government and the local communities.

Sanjorge indicates that it will be in the short run before we know if the gas at sea shale can be exploited.

Many ecologists believe that hyperacidic displacement of substrate can damage the marine environments, and to the extraction new fossile fuel resources are opposed. But drilling at sea avoids the need for difficult negotiations with the councils, the communities and the holder of piece buildings.

Based on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - to 100 cubic feet trillion, which would be more than the evaluations of GAStech for its earth resources. There is also the possibility of finding oil.

GAStech estimated that the resources at sea shale gas of total of Kronos could take place between five and 10 moments the size of terrestrial available of resources.

"We are who it resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous," said very comfortable SanJorge. "Is there one that exploitable? It is billion question of the dollar, and GAStech wiling to invest in the answer."

Although it very recently became discussed, hyperacidic displacement of substrate was employed on one on a smaller scale during much of years, to improve the flow of the conventional gas and oil wells. But to employ the process on a great number of wells had to at sea extract gas from schist commercially was never made.

Professor Oskar Wertz of university of Tethys is skeptic approximately if the shale gas at sea could be large contributing to European energy in the following decade, but known as which it could have the longer-term potential.

"GAStech is optimistic is its evaluations of how long it will take to explore the shale at sea. It is perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, technology hyperacidic of displacement of substrate will have thus advanced and the way in which we treat the marine environment will have thus advanced that this could be a really large industry. To give the responsability in 10 years to come is to test these things outside, see whether they function."

TITLE: Hospital of Abila seeing the surge of the users of drug of originator


PUBLISHED: 2013/02/09
The department of help at the hospital general of Abila in Kronos was flooded in last month by people suffering from the medical complications of drugs of originator such as the "cotton sugar" and the synthetic marijuana, a civil servant of hospital known as.

"We had at least two cases dozen in last month," said Alicia Bianca, director of nurse of the department. "We are literally overpowered."

Bianca indicated that it forever considering this level of activity related to the overdoses of drug in seven years when it controlled the department of help and in 20 years it was a nurse.

The authorities in "cotton sugar" by Abila could have been a factor in the 54 years death Ralf trail, of which bruised and naked body was found on February 4 along a road of dead-end. The investigators await reports of toxicology to determine the cause of its death. Everywhere in the city, several deaths were allotted to the "sugar cotton" according to the national center of poison of Kronos.

The patients come in the general from Abila from in all the larger area from city, and they include adults and youths, male and female, and all the levels socio-economic, Bianca known as.

Sgt Antonio Arresta of the department of fire of Abila, a first-responder with the medical calls of help in the city, indicated that its department also saw a transient in the number of people needing treatment for complications for drugs for originator. "We went from calls zero to a handle of calls" in last month," it said.

Bianca and Arresta known as their efforts to treat people is made more difficult because they often do not know anything about drugs originator which were taken.

"You do not know what you obtain when you obtain it," in Bianca known as. "We made act with the patients to enter and out of the order, who are very violent one. They say to us that they had made the cotton sugar or the synthetic marijuana."

Bianca says there is little clinical data on the effects of the cotton sugar, because it is an incipient poison. "There is no study ordered in toxicology," it said. The national center of poison gathers anecdotal reports on overdoses of the hospitals and other suppliers as an element of the efforts to offer the council on the way in which to treat patients.

Drugs of originator are the chemical compounds synthesized to resemble the active substance in often illegal drugs. The cotton sugar imitates a stimulant. The manufacturers frequently change the chemical composition and its name of drug of originator into stage of the stay one in front of the authorities, Biance known as. "It is another manner of selling it," it said.

The cotton sugar refinery of limit, for example, is a nickname of drug and does not have anything to make with the feast of carnival. Drug was sold under the name of "spice dreams" one week and under the name of the "flower of tulip" the next one. 

The government of Kronos placed three of the chemicals used generally in the creation of the cotton sugar on its ordered list of substance, criminaliing their use and possession. Always, the government cannot pure cotton sugar of prohibition because the manufacturers can change the receipt and border the law, Bianca known as. Drugs are sold on line as products "of therapy of sweet herbs" and are available above the meter in stores of sector.

"We still do not know what obtain with the cotton sugar. The chemical composition changes package with the package," Bianca known as.

A factor for the popularity of the cotton sugar is its  cut price, Bianca knowns. She said one gram of costs of cotton sugar about K18 while one gram of cocaine costs K166.

The cotton sugar creates the euphorism, or high, with which is equal or larger than than of cocaine but also causes with an accident which is worse, Bianca known as. Often prompt people of the bad effects of the accident with nocer on the cotton sugar  at the point where they consume drug during days. "They beseech it," it said.

After repeated the use, drug "makes fry" the brain of a person, draining the chemicals which balance its operations. This leads sometimes to the odd behavior and often psychotic who was brought back in the media, such as the case of the naked man in Elodis which was operation found in bottom of the medium of an important road, Bianca known as. "The seizures and the illusions are incredible," it said.

While it is not yet certain which is behind the distribution of this round of drugs of originator, the suspect organized crime of police force continues this great source of income. The popular army of Asterian was traditionally implied traffic of drug in all the area, and them agencies of application examine thoroughly the possible co-operation between the organizations of traffic of drug and the insurgent groups political.

Traffic snarled around the city as Abilians struggle to get to work amid vandalism and looting 

Early on Tuesday police stormed the front of the presidential mansion and the capital building, breaking up a sit in by the Protectors of Kronos. 

The conservative Kronos government used an emergency law to threaten the protestors with arrest unless they dispersed and returned to work.  The row is over environmental issues the POK holds the government and the gas giant GAStech international responsible.  

Signs among the protester called for government change and social equality.  Images of Juliana Vann, the 10 year old girl who dies from illnesses attributed to the industrial giant GAStech international served as rallying points.   

Tuesday was the third anniversary of the mysterious death of Elian Karel, a popular leader of the POK who died in prison.  

Later in the day, what had been a largely peaceful demonstration turned violent when the crowd started vandalizing government buildings and the presidential homestead.  

Police reinforcements were sent to the area and blocked roads, and skirmishes between the police and protestors broke out.  

Police used tear gas to break up the unruly crowd.  Government spokesmen complemented the security forces for their handling of the "gangs of criminals" disrupting the peace.

<<deleted image of Elian Karel speaking at a rally in Abila>> 

Voice of protest for some, popularist demagogue for others, Protectors of Kronos leader Elian Karel became a martyr and a rallying point for some; a figure of disdain and rabblerousing for others, and a political concern to the Kronosian government, within an event filled year, accented by his suspicious death on Friday.  

The leader of a forbearant environmental activist group, Karel had started a brand of politics all his own, that propelled the POK into the spotlight of this island nation. 

Fueled by a growing dissatisfaction with the heavy-handed Kronosian government, he started driving the POK into an action-based organization, instead of one waiting for their government to make things aright. 

Resurrecting the embers of the Juliana Vann campaign, the 10 year old girl who died from illnesses attributed to the government-favored GASTech corporation's industrial waste streams in 1998, Karel was arrested and thrown in jail following a POK-initiated human roadblock in front of GAStech headquarters in May. Karel died Wednesday while serving time in jail. 

Rather charismatic, Karel was able to inspire a crowd and draw attention to the POK social and political agenda. likened the POK to a terrorist group in a press interview, Karel  quipped, "Sanjorge is a brilliant leader of GAStech."

TITLE: GAStech Profile 

PUBLISHED: 2013/02/22

It is the biggest company in Kronos, the third largest gas company on the planet, and it is fifty-three years old. In the past it has had a reputation as corrupt and environmentally harmful, but nowadays GAStech, the former Tethys-only business, is trying to earn the trust of international investors. 

It is an uphill task, and there is no certainty that Gastech has the ability to convince potential investors it has mended its ways, and is no longer rooted in the eco-hostile past. 

GAStech's pipeline operations are based in eastern Kronos, and there is close relationship with the Kronosian government. This is the heart of Kronos's pipeline business, where gas from the eastern gas fields is piped west towards the rest of Kronos, Tethys and Europe. 

GAStech does more than just pump gas. 

The head of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, whose photo stares out from calendars and picture frames everywhere in the country, acknowledges the "state within a state" accusations, but argues that the company simply needs to look after its workers and the communities around them. The GAStech empire owns 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its company farms, runs gyms, and offers subsidised holidays in Black Sea resorts for key employees. There is an argument, however, that the energy business is different from other industries, requiring energy corporations to operate in distinct ways. 

Working in far-off places with no previous infrastructure means oil and gas sites will always be, to some extent, company towns. GAStech certainly strives to ensure its employees can move in and out of these locations by operating a private fleet of four planes to ferry its staff the huge distances between sites.

<<Deleted Image: Anti-offshore drilling protester.  Exploration has proved a controversial issue in Kronos>> 

Continue reading the main story  

The son of the founder of gas firm GAStech is planning a venture to drill in the Mediterranean Sea, the Times has learned. He believes there are large volumes of offshore gas that could be extracted. 

"Certainly offshore gas isn't a new concept, but there's no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can't develop these resources offshore," he told the Times. 

Shale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within. 

Hyper-acidic substrate removal has produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the West, transforming the energy market. 

Sanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited. 

Based on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech's estimates for its onshore resources. 

GAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore. 

Though it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done. 

Professor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term. 

"GAStech is being optimistic is its estimates of how long it will take to explore offshore shale. It's perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyper-acidic substrate removal technology will have so advanced and the way in which we deal with the offshore environment will have so advanced that this could be a really big industry.

    Founded in 1997. 

    Influenced by international groups such as Wellness for All 

    Mixes political activism with environmental work 

    Rejects use of violence and supports democratic principles 

    Slogan: "Justice for Juliana", a reference to a 10-year old Kronosian girl who died as a result of government sponsored environmental contamination  

 
The decision was in response to Tuesday's bombing of a police headquarters in Abila, he said. 

"Kronos was horrified from north to south by the hideous crime committed by the POK," Mr. Drymiau said. 

"This was in context of dangerous escalation to violence against Kronos and Kronosians and a clear declaration by the POK that it knows nothing but violence. 

"It's not possible for Kronos the state nor Kronos the people to submit to the POK terrorism." 

POK supporters 

The POK has denied being responsible for the attack, and accused the Kronos government of staging a frame-up to silence the groups concerns for the people.

TITLE: Centrum's central role in the Tethan Gas Industry  

PUBLISHED: 1982/10/02

The world of gas is distant, difficult and far flung. In Tethys a few years ago, I journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of Tethys to look at a contentious new energy producing area. 

One of the sites I visited was a local office of the Sanjorge Gas company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation. 

But I'd forgotten about the encounter until I went back to Tethys the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: one man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it. 

But as I went round the capital city of Centrum interviewing people, I soon realised that this was not just a story of new energy. Something very significant has happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas industry expertise. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, turning an island of coal into a place with abundant oil and gas supplies. 

It seemed to us on the west coast of Scotland that the far flung city of Centrum, Tethys was getting a bit big for its boots, starting to believe in a new fantasy industry. 

By the early 1970s, a new gas company, GAStech, began its juggernaut-like advances. 

Under his canny guidance, GAStech evolved into a major supplier of natural gas to the local region, and then much further afield.  You notice them in the constant clutter of helicopters to-ing and fro-ing out to remote areas, and the planes lined up at the city's airport to shuttle execs back and forth from the city. But Sanjorge has just been asked to produce a report for the Tethan government recommending the best ways of ensuring that Tethys continues to produce energy for decades to come. 

The easy-to-get stuff has been produced, so keeping the gas coming will need much investment and more clever new techniques, such as the hyper-acidic substrate removal techniques developed by the company in 1974.  

So thanks to clever people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, Centrum has achieved what every place where raw materials are discovered longs to do. The city has taken the temporary boon of energy on its doorstep, and turned it into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which may make Centrum a centre of gas expertise long after the gas itself runs out.

While the global press reported over 2500 people were killed and 100,000 buildings were destroyed, local press reported people felt they were being properly cared for and declined relief aid.  

The Global Emergency Disaster Organization report their members are doing all they can to get aid through to earthquake victims, but they need a huge injections of funds to do so.   

Jim Cordon, from the disaster relief charity FoodSupport told the times "I think that the lack of funds are responsible for an increase of attacks on food convoys, consequently deterring a lot of aid agencies from getting in there."

Interpol has announced the formation of a new multi-country task force to combat the increasingly wide distribution of the drug methyldimethyl cathinone (MDMC).  Heading the task force is Senior Inspector Robert Loblaw, a veteran officer who led the very successful Tethys Counterdrug Team. 

"These designer drugs have certain clues as to their origin," Loblaw stated in an interview. 

This particular blend of the drug MDMC, also known by its street names "cotton candy", "spice dreams" and "Tulip Blossom", was found previously only in Asteria but has made its way to the streets of Tethys and other international countries. 

The Asterian People's Army (APA) is a paramilitary organization which has been engaged in terrorist activities funded through its criminal enterprises, which include drug trafficking.  In recent years the APA has sought to build their brand through websites and the publication of a professional, high-quality magazine called "Arise". 
 
Senior Inspector Loblaw says the Tethys public statistics indicate MDMC is a growing problem with the country's youth.  "An increase in mental health problems, including hallucinations and paranoia, accompanied by violent behavior and a marked increase in suicide rates are only a few of the indicators of the usage of this designer drug."

It is clear that Elian Karel, which professes to have the interests of the people of Kronos in the middle, must explain to us why it refuses to contribute to the wellbeing of its nation.

TITLE: Richard Blumenthal Calls NYT Report 'Outrageous Distortion'

PUBLISHED: 2010/05/18

HARTFORD, Conn. â€” Connecticut Attorney General and U.S. Senate candidate Richard Blumenthal is defending himself against a report he misstated his military service in Vietnam.
 Blumenthal's campaign called a New York Times report which includes video of him at a 2008 event saying he had served "in Vietnam" an "outrageous distortion" on his record.
 Here's an excerpt from the Times report:
 ""We have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam," Mr. Blumenthal said to the group gathered in Norwalk in March 2008. "And you exemplify it. Whatever we think about the war, whatever we call it -- Afghanistan or Iraq -- we owe our military men and women unconditional support."
 There was one problem: Mr. Blumenthal, a Democrat now running for the United States Senate, never served in Vietnam. He obtained at least five military deferments from 1965 to 1970 and took repeated steps that enabled him to avoid going to war, according to records."
 Blumenthal says he's always tried to make it clear his Marine Reserve service never took him overseas. But, the Times reported, "an examination of his remarks at the ceremonies shows that he does not volunteer that his service never took him overseas. And he describes the hostile reaction directed at veterans coming back from Vietnam, intimating that he was among them."
 Blumenthal told the Times he had misspoken at the 2008 event in Norfolk in which he said he served in Vietnam.
 In a televised March debate, Blumenthal stated clearly he had not served in Vietnam.
 Blumenthal's campaign said he planned an event Tuesday with veterans showing their support for him.
 Kevin Rennie, a former Republican state lawmaker, published a blog post stating that the Times piece was "fed to the paper by the Linda McMahon [Senate] campaign." McMahon, the CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, is one of the Republican Senate candidates running to face Blumenthal in November.
 Rennie wrote: "The Blumenthal Bombshell comes at the end of more than 2 months of deep, persistent research by Republican Linda McMahon's Senate campaign. It gave the explosive Norwalk video recording to The Times. This is what comes of $16 million, a crack opposition research operation and an opponent who, in the words of the president Blumenthal worked for on a draft deferment, who gave them the sword."
 Rennie's article was initially re-posted on Linda McMahon's website, but the story has since been removed.
 On Tuesday morning, a set of response points were circulated by Democrats close to Blumenthal's campaign:
 -Here are the facts: unlike many of his peers, Dick Blumenthal voluntarily joined the Marine Corps Reserves in 1970 and served for six months in Parris Island, SC and six years in the reserves. He received no special treatment from anyone. Today's story unfortunately distorts Dick Blumenthal's record of service by implying that he did not serve.
 -In the past twenty years, Dick has attended literally hundreds of vets events, debates, news conferences where he was clear, honest, and proud about his service in the Marine Corps Reserve. In fact, as recently as the US Senate debate on March 1, 2010, Blumenthal clearly stated "serving in the United States military gave me a perspective as well, even in the reserves. Although I did not serve in Vietnam, I have seen first-hand the affects of military action, and no one wants it to be the first resort, nor do we want to mortgage the countries future...."
 -Dick has been a constant champion of veterans and of the military. Today Connecticut veterans will come together to show they have his back, just like he has had theirs.
 -On a few occasions out of hundreds, Dick misspoke and he'll be the first to admit that those were mistakes. That doesn't take anything away from Dick's service or his long record of standing up for veterans - he is known throughout the state as a strong advocate for vets services and benefits.
 -His opponent's campaign admits they are the ones who cherry-picked the quotes and are behind the hit piece. It is no surprise Linda McMahon would want to smear the Attorney General, considering all of the debauchery at the WWF under her watch, including her attempt to interfere with an investigation into widespread drug abuse.
 UPDATE: Richard Blumenthal defended himself against charges that he repeatedly made misleading comments about his military service during a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. Details here.

TITLE: White House Asked Bill Clinton To Talk To Joe Sestak About Senate Run

PUBLISHED: 2010/05/28

Rep. Joe Sestak (D-Penn.) was offered a prominent but uncompensated, advisory position -- in the national security/foreign policy area -- if he declined to enter the Pennsylvania Senate primary race, a source with knowledge of the exchange said during a briefing on Friday morning.
 The offer was made by White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel through a prominent intermediary -- former President Bill Clinton -- during the months of June and July of 2009. The White House initiated the conversation, which occurred over phone. It would have allowed Sestak to remain in the House of Representatives while advising the president. The source said it would not be surprising if more than one conversation took place, though there were no other intermediaries involved. Sestak ultimately rejected the overture and went on to defeat incumbent Sen. Arlen Specter (D-Penn) in the Democratic primary election earlier this month.
 "By virtue of his career in public service, including distinguished military service, Congressman Sestak was viewed to be highly qualified to hold a range of advisory positions in which he could, while holding his House seat, have additional responsibilities of considerable potential interest to him and value to the Executive Branch," a memo detailing the administration's findings reads.
 The account offered by the source was the most detailed to date from primary sources as to the conversations they had with Sestak regarding his entrance into the Pennsylvania race. News of the Clinton conversation was first reported by Greg Sargent at The Plum Line. The source challenged one major aspect of the story line, insisting that the White House never offered Sestak the job of Secretary of the Navy. The offer for that position was made more than a month before -- on March 26, 2009 -- to Ray Mabus.
 Administration officials had spent time and capital recruiting Senator Arlen Specter to switch parties and run for re-election as a Democrat. Part of that arrangement entailed clearing the field for his nomination. When Sestak began making overtures that he would run, the White House looked for ways to follow through on its promise. What resulted were the informal conversation(s).
 Since then, much intrigue has surrounded what conversations actually took place. Sestak brought the issue to the surface when he alluded to a job offer early in his primary run. But he refused to provide details, such as who approached him and what position was dangled in front of him. The White House, when pressed on the matter, had been vague. Press Secretary Robert Gibbs declined repeated attempts for comment before relaying to reporters that he and White House lawyers had looked into the matter and found it legally permissible.
 Behind the scenes, White House Counsel Bob Bauer's office began investigating the matter when stories first surfaced. The investigation was internal at first with the White House reaching conclusions at least two-and-a-half months ago. As part of the process, however, Bauer also interviewed representatives for Sestak and Clinton -- in this case Sestak's brother and Doug Brand and Bruce Lindsey respectively. The congressman and the former president were not contacted for Bauer's investigation.
 The source insisted that no laws were broken in the process of offering the position, that the matter hardly rose to the level of political scandal -- suggesting that Republicans on the Hill were hoping to reap political benefits from the saga. It certainly wasn't historically unique. As the Huffington Post reported on Thursday, various political historians and ethics lawyers have approached the Sestak news with yawns, noting that quid pro quos and backroom job offers are fairly common in administrations.

TITLE: Reid Breaks With Obama Over Proposed Ground Zero Mosque

PUBLISHED: 2010/08/16

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid broke with President Obama Monday over the proposed mosque near Ground Zero, saying the controversial Islamic center should be built elsewhere.
 Spokesman Jim Manley said in a written statement that Republicans should show their sincerity about sensitivity to Sept. 11 survivors by backing a high-profile bill to grant health benefits to rescue workers, something that stalled in Congress earlier this month.
 But at the same time, Manley put Reid on the record for the first time in the hyper-sensitive and volatile mosque debate.
 "The First Amendment protects freedom of religion," Manley said. "Sen. Reid respects that but thinks that the mosque should be built someplace else."
 Reid's comments added another high-profile voice to the mosque controversy. The president first stepped into the fray Friday when he appeared to endorse the Park 51 project during a Ramadan dinner at the White House. The next day, he clarified that he was merely commenting on fundamental religious freedoms -- not specifically on the "wisdom" of the mosque project. Then White House spokesman Bill Burton said Obama was not "backing off" his original remarks.
 The prolonged presidential explanation elevated the issue beyond a local dispute and hurled it into the political arena. Republicans have since both criticized his position and pressured other Democrats to take a stand on the politically sticky issue, one where charges of insensitivity have flown on both sides.
 The White House claimed Monday that politics were not at play in Obama's decision to dive into the controversy over a planned mosque near Ground Zero.
 Burton said that he "can't speak to the politics of what the Republicans are doing," but the president was not looking to make political hay with his remarks, which he reportedly considered carefully before delivering them at a White House dinner on Friday night.
 "The president didn't do this because of the politics. He spoke about it because he feels he has an obligation as the president to address this," Burton said.
 But the issue was quickly feeding fuel to Republicans looking to corner Democrats into taking a position on the issue -- something they were able to avoid before the president spoke up.
 Though Reid is on the record, the National Republican Senatorial Committee on Monday targeted Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., for not speaking out on the issue. Citing an article that said the normally chatty Schumer would not comment on the mosque remarks, the NRSC said Schumer should weigh in.
 "It's a remarkable commentary on the most camera-friendly senator that he's more than happy to weigh-in on caffeinated malt beverages, but he won't take a public position on the construction of a mosque near Ground Zero," NRSC spokesman Brian Walsh said in a written statement.
 "It's time for Chuck Schumer to stand up and be counted -- does he stand with President Obama in support of this mosque or does he stand with the countless 9/11 families who believe its location is inappropriate?" Walsh asked.
 Walsh also suggested Reid would suffer politically from his allegiance to Obama on other issues, despite his stance on the mosque.
 "While it's commendable that Senator Reid now agrees with Republican Sharron Angle that we should respect the wishes of 9/11 families, it's regrettable that he hasn't demonstrated this same independence from President Obama on the critical issues facing America during the last 19 months," he said.
 Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who opposes the mosque project, said Monday that the White House softened Obama's original comments because it probably heard "pushback" from other Democrats. He said Obama was "clearly" taking a side on the issue no matter what he claims.
 "Everyone says as far as I know that the Muslim community has the right to build a mosque. The whole question is whether they should or not," he told Fox News. "So for the president to raise it in the way he did on Friday was clearly giving the impression that he was endorsing it or supporting it -- or tacitly supporting it."
 Most Americans think the group planning the mosque and Islamic cultural center has the right to build it, according to a Fox News poll released Friday. However, the poll showed that 64 percent think it would be wrong to build it, regardless of whether the developers are within their right to do so.
 Supporters of the mosque and cultural center in lower Manhattan, including New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, say its development should stand as a testament to religious tolerance in America. They say it would be a mistake to equate Islam as a whole, and its practice in the United States, with Al Qaeda -- and remind critics that Muslims were also killed in the attacks on the World Trade Center.
 Burton said Monday that the president weighed in as part of a constitutional discussion.
 "The president thinks that it's his obligation to speak out when ... issues of the Constitution arise. And so, in this case, he decided to state clearly how he feels about making sure that people are treated equally, that there is a fairness and that our bedrock principles are upheld," Burton said.
 He added the administration can't control the conversation on cable TV or in newspapers, but the White House has had a "pretty fulsome conversation" about it and has addressed it to a "pretty full extent."
 "I think that it's a debate that was had and we've weighed in," Burton said.

TITLE: GOP Senators Keep Pressure on Steele Over 'Inaccurate' Afghanistan Comments

PUBLISHED: 2010/07/04

Republican senators kept up pressure on party Chairman Michael Steele Sunday to better explain -- and publicly apologize for -- his on-camera claim that Afghanistan is a "war of Obama's choosing" and may not be winnable.
 The backlash built quickly over the weekend as some prominent conservatives called for Steele's resignation. Speaking on "Fox News Sunday," Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., would not go that far but said Steele must apologize to the troops.
 "Chairman Steele needs to apologize to our military, all the men and women who've been fighting in Afghanistan," he said. "This is America's war. It's not Obama's war."
 The GOP chairman is known for off-the-cuff and occasionally troublesome comments, but the Afghanistan remarks were too much to bear for some war-supporting Republicans.
 DeMint, who said Afghanistan is a war the United States must win, said Steele needs to "refocus" on the November election. He called Steele's comments "unacceptable" and "inaccurate."
 "We need a chairman who's focused," DeMint said.
 Speaking on ABC's "This Week," Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Steele's comments were "wildly inaccurate."
 The Arizona Republican said Steele needs to assess whether he can still function in his job and must make "an appropriate decision" about his future.
 Trying to quell the furor, Steele issued a statement saying: "There is no question that America must win the war on terror. ... And, for the sake of the security of the free world, our country must give our troops the support necessary to win this war."
 He sent an e-mail to RNC members saying he hoped his statement would "clear up any confusion" caused by his earlier remarks.
 That didn't seem to quiet the controversy in the slightest. Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, who led the charge of conservatives calling for Steele to step down over the remark, said on "Fox News Sunday" that Steele still needs to go -- though he said Steele tried to convince him otherwise.
 "I think it would be better if he went," he said.

TITLE: While Blumenthal Retains Washington Support, Republicans Smell Opening in CT

PUBLISHED: 2010/05/18

Democratic Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, once thought to be a shoo-in for the seat being vacated by Sen. Chris Dodd, D-CT, finds himself on the political ropes after a newspaper exposed a past incorrect statement regarding his service in Vietnam, and Republicans smell an opening.
 Sen. John Cornyn, R-TX, who heads the GOP campaign committee, said Tuesday, "I think it's a blockbuster revelation," and predicted, "I think it's definitely going to make that race more competitive."
 Blumenthal's campaign disputed a report in the New York Times as an "outrageous distortion" of his service in the Marines - six months on Paris Island and six years in the reserves, according to his campaign. The A.G., according to the Times, said he had misspoken at a 2008 event in Norfolk in which he said he had served in Vietnam.
 At that March 2 event, which can be found here on You Tube, Blumenthal, advocating for troops returning from war, clearly says, "We have learned something very important since the days that I served in Vietnam... whatever we think about the war, whatever we call it 'Afghanistan or Iraq, we owe our military men and women unconditional support."
 Cornyn's Democratic campaign counterpart, Sen. Bob Menendez, D-NJ, Tuesday offered a critical vote of confidence in the attorney general, saying his lifetime of support for veterans is what really matters.
 "I think he's corrected the record in the past. I think his actions standing up for veterans for a long time speaks volumes," Menendez said, "I'm sure he will continue to stay in the race...and we'll continue to support him."
 Dodd, who faced an onslaught of criticism for his involvement with now-defunct Countrywide mortgage broker, among other problems, quickly scuttled his re-election plans in order to make way for the exceedingly popular Blumenthal, when it was clear in polls that Dodd was not likely to win his race.
 Blumenthal will face the winner of the GOP primary on August 10 - either former Cong. Rob Simmons, himself a Vietnam vet, or former WWE wrestling executive Linda McMahon.
 The attorney general is scheduled to appear at a news conference later today with veterans at the Veterans of Foreign Wars post in West Hartford.

Beck Wows the CPAC Crowd
 Glenn Beck, the hero of the political right and the closing speaker of a three-day conservative conference, ripped the roof off a Washington hotel Saturday with a sweeping denunciation of progressivism.
 Progressivism, he told the Conservative Political Action Conference, is a cancer that must be cut out of the system.
 But he aimed his fire at Republicans as well as Democrats, and gave them little quarter, saying he did not know what the Republicans stood for.
 â€œItâ€™s not enough just to not suck as much as the other side,â€\\x9d he said.
 Noting that he was a recovering alcoholic himself, he said that the party had to admit that it had a problem, which he had not heard it do.
 â€œHello, my name is the Republican Party and I have a problem!â€\\x9d he declared. â€œIâ€™m addicted to spending and big government,â€\\x9d he said, drawing cheers and applause from the thousands of people packed into the hotel ballroom.
 But both parties are to blame, he said. The Democrats tax and spend, while the Republicans just spend.
 People are losing a fundamental belief that things will get better, he said.
 â€œIt is still morning in America,â€\\x9d he posited, â€œit just happens to be kind of a head-pounding, hung-over, vomiting-for-four-hours kind of morning in America. And itâ€™s shaping up to be kind of a nasty day, but itâ€™s still morning in America.â€\\x9d
 When the audience finished laughing, he asked: â€œWhat made us sit there at the john making us vomit for four hours? What are we suffering from?â€\\x9d
 Saying President Obama, he said, was â€œtoo simple an answer.â€\\x9d
 The real problem, he said, is progressivism, scrawling the word with chalk on his signature blackboard. â€œThis is the disease in America,â€\\x9d he said.
 He held the audience spellbound with riffs on his personal life laced through his political philosophy, strong on personal responsibility.
 â€œWho can guarantee you happiness?â€œ he asked. â€œTiger Woods wasnâ€™t happy.â€\\x9d
 If you find financial success on the road to happiness, he said, conservatives believe â€œyou shouldnâ€™t be demonized or penalized by it.â€\\x9d
 â€œIâ€™m not going to pay for your mistakes and I donâ€™t expect you to pay for my mistakes,â€\\x9d he said, to wild applause.

TITLE: NAACP Resolution Calls on Tea Party to Repudiate 'Racist Elements' in Movement

PUBLISHED: 2010/07/14

The NAACP adopted a resolution Tuesday condemning "racist elements" in the Tea Party movement and calling on the movement's leaders to repudiate bigotry, despite claims from Tea Partiers that the measure is just a political ploy.
 The nation's leading civil rights group took up the language at its annual convention in Kansas City, Mo. The resolution initially said the NAACP would "repudiate the racism of the Tea Parties" and stand against the movement's attempt to "push our country back to the pre-civil rights era," though the wording was amended to downplay criticism of all Tea Partiers while asking them to repudiate bigots in their own ranks.
 "We take no issue with the Tea Party movement. We believe in freedom of assembly and people raising their voices in a democracy," the NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous said in a written statement announcing the unanimous vote. "What we take issue with is the Tea Party's continued tolerance for bigotry and bigoted statements.
 "The time has come for them to accept the responsibility that comes with influence and make clear there is no place for racism and anti-Semitism, homophobia and other forms of bigotry in their movement."
 NAACP leaders have referenced an incident in March when Tea Party protesters allegedly hurled racial epithets at black lawmakers on Capitol Hill ahead of a health care vote.
 But Tea Party members have challenged claims that their activists accosted black lawmakers in March and no visual evidence has been produced depicting a racist attack. Dallas Tea Party founder Phillip Dennis said "there was no proof" of racist behavior at the event and that the movement welcomes minority members.
 "We don't care about the pigment of one's skin," he said. Dennis accused the NAACP of playing the "race card" and called the organization "irrelevant."
 The nearby St. Louis Tea Party had an all-hands-on-deck response to the NAACP's plan. The group has drafted a resolution of its own condemning the civil rights group for reducing itself to a "bigoted" and "partisan attack dog organization."
 Debate was mostly closed to the public, but the final version "calls on the tea party and all people of good will to repudiate the racist element and activities within the tea party," said Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP's Washington bureau.
 The final wording won't be released until the NAACP's national board of directors approves the resolution during its meeting in October. But the original called for the NAACP to "educate its membership and the community that this movement is not just about higher taxes and limited government." It said something could evolve "and become more dangerous for that small percentage of people that really think our country has been taken away from them."
 In a matter of hours, the St. Louis group fired off to the NAACP the statement demanding the organization withdraw its "bigoted, false and inflammatory" resolution. The missive accused the NAACP of resorting to political tactics and urged the IRS to reconsider whether it can continue to qualify for tax-exempt status.
 Tea Party organizers routinely defend themselves against charges of racism, disavowing racially charged signs that appear in their protest crowds and provide fodder for Tea Party critics. The NAACP resolution, first reported by the Kansas City Star, was expected to make reference to the March incident on Capitol Hill.
 St. Louis Tea Party organizer Bill Hennessy wrote on the group's website Tuesday that the Tea Party stands for smaller government and fiscal responsibility, and accused the NAACP of abandoning black America.
 "When you look at the crime and poverty and family breakdown of the African-American community ... you see a half-century of failure by the NAACP," he wrote. "None of those persistent problems was caused by the Tea Party movement, yet the principles of the Tea Party are exactly what's needed to wind down the multigenerational destruction in the African-American community.
 "The NAACP was once a vital weapon in the war against segregation and oppression. All that's left is a bigoted and malicious shell that does far more harm than good for people who need a break," he wrote.
 Fellow St. Louis Tea Party organizer Dana Loesch accused the NAACP of morphing into a political organization.
 â€œThey no longer prioritize civil rights,â€\\x9d she told Fox News.

TITLE: Etheridge, Caught on Video, Apologizes

PUBLISHED: 2010/06/15

Representative Bob Etheridge, Democrat of North Carolina, issued an apology on Monday for grabbing a young man by the hand, arm and neck â€“ as a video camera rolled â€“ as the man tried to ask him whether he supports President Obamaâ€™s agenda.
 â€œI deeply and profoundly regret my reaction and I apologize to all involved,â€\\x9d Mr. Etheridge said in a statement.  â€œThroughout my many years of service to the people of North Carolina, I have always tried to treat people from all viewpoints with respect.  No matter how intrusive and partisan our politics can become, this does not justify a poor response.â€\\x9d
 He added, â€œI have and I will always work to promote a civil public discourse.â€\\x9d
 A young man, dressed in a jacket and tie, approached the congressman on a sidewalk, saying: â€œHi, Congressman. How are you? Do you fully support the Obama agenda?â€\\x9d
 Mr. Etheridge, a seven-term House member, can be seen on the video repeatedly asking the young man to identify himself.  After a few seconds, the congressman grabs the camera and the young man.
 â€œTell me who you are,â€\\x9d Mr. Etheridge said. â€œTell me who you are.â€\\x9d
 The young man is not identified in the video, which was made last week.  A second person accompanying him pulled out another camera to record the congressmanâ€™s actions.  The video received widespread attention on Monday after it was posted on the Web site of Andrew Breitbart, a conservative Web publisher and former editor of The Drudge Report.  It was circulated by the National Republican Congressional Committee.
 â€œBob Etheridge has lost it,â€\\x9d said Jon Thompson, a Republican spokesman.  â€œHis conduct is unbecoming of a member of Congress.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Etheridge, who represents a conservative district south of Raleigh, faces a re-election challenge, but his race is not among the top Republican targets in the country.  He won two years ago by 36 percentage points, and Mr. Obama carried his district by 6 percent.
 Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. resumed the White House campaign for gun control on Tuesday by reporting on executive action taken unilaterally by the administration and pressing Congress to take up legislation again.

TITLE: Michael Steele Criticized for Afghanistan Comments

PUBLISHED: 2010/07/02

WASHINGTON â€” Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, drew fierce criticism and a call for his resignation on Friday after declaring at a party fund-raiser that the United States was on the wrong side of history with its conflict in Afghanistan, a military fight he called â€œa war of Obamaâ€™s choosing.â€\\x9d
 â€œThis is not something the United States had actively prosecuted or wanted to engage in,â€\\x9d Mr. Steele said in a speech Thursday night in Connecticut in which he offered a strong critique of President Obamaâ€™s military strategy.
 â€œIt was the president who was trying to be cute by half by flipping a script demonizing Iraq, while saying the battle really should be Afghanistan,â€\\x9d Mr. Steele said, according to a video of his remarks that was circulated by Democrats on Friday. â€œWell, if heâ€™s such a student of history, has he not understood that you know thatâ€™s the one thing you donâ€™t do, is engage in a land war in Afghanistan?â€\\x9d
 Mr. Steele, seeking to clarify his remarks, issued a statement on Friday afternoon, saying, â€œThere is no question that America must win the war on terror.â€\\x9d
 His remarks were the latest in a string of controversial statements that he has made as party chairman.
 The war in Afghanistan, which has entered its ninth year, was started by former President George W. Bush in response to the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Obama shifted the focus on the war on terrorism from Iraq to Afghanistan and last year announced his plan to send 30,000 more troops there.
 Mr. Steeleâ€™s comments prompted William Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard and a leading voice of conservative support for the war in Afghanistan, to call for Mr. Steeleâ€™s resignation as party leader.
 â€œYour tenure has, of course, been marked by gaffes and embarrassments, but I for one have never paid much attention to them, and have never thought they would matter much to the success of the causes and principles we share,â€\\x9d Mr. Kristol wrote Friday. He added, â€œNeedless to say, the war in Afghanistan was not â€˜a war of Obamaâ€™s choosing.â€™ It has been prosecuted by the United States under Presidents Bush and Obama.â€\\x9d
 He added, â€œThere are, of course, those who think we should pull out of Afghanistan, and theyâ€™re certainly entitled to make their case. But one of them shouldnâ€™t be the chairman of the Republican Party.â€\\x9d
 A spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, Brad Woodhouse, said Mr. Steele was â€œbetting against our troops and rooting for failure in Afghanistan.â€\\x9d Republican officials dismissed that criticism.
 When Mr. Steele made the remarks, he was speaking to Republican contributors at a fund-raiser in Connecticut. Linda McMahon, the partyâ€™s candidate for the United States Senate in Connecticut, was in the audience, along with other leading state Republicans. The video appears to have been taken by a hidden camera at an event that was closed to the press. Republican officials did not dispute the authenticity of the video, but disputed its characterization.
 In his statement on Friday afternoon, Mr. Steele did not respond to the call for his resignation. But he sought to make the case that Afghanistan is now Mr. Obamaâ€™s war.
 â€œFor the sake of the security of the free world, our country must give our troops the support necessary to win this war,â€\\x9d Mr. Steele said. â€œAs we have learned throughout history, winning a war in Afghanistan is a difficult task. We must also remember that after the tragedy of Sept. 11, 2001, it is also a necessary one.â€\\x9d
 He added, with a reference to Gen. David H. Petraeus: â€œThat is why I supported the decision to increase our troop force and, like the entire United States Senate, I support General Petraeusâ€™s confirmation. The stakes are too high for us to accept anything but success in Afghanistan.â€\\x9d

TITLE: G.O.P. Seizes on Mosque Issue Ahead of Elections

PUBLISHED: 2010/08/14

WASHINGTON â€” Republican Congressional candidates on Monday intensified efforts to inject the divide over construction of an Islamic center near ground zero into the midterm campaigns while the Senateâ€™s top Democrat said he objected to the mosque being built there.
 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader and a Democrat facing a difficult re-election fight, said through a spokesman that those who plan to erect the Islamic center should look elsewhere. That separates Mr. Reid from President Obamaâ€™s support of the developersâ€™ right to build the center.
 â€œThe First Amendment protects freedom of religion,â€\\x9d said Jim Manley, a top adviser to Mr. Reid. â€œSenator Reid respects that but thinks that the mosque should be built someplace else.â€\\x9d
 In a number of releases and statements, Republican House and Senate candidates challenged Democrats like Mr. Reid to make their positions clear on the construction of a mosque and community center about two blocks from the site of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in New York City.
 â€œGround zero is hallowed ground to Americans,â€\\x9d Elliott Maynard, a Republican trying to unseat Representative Nick J. Rahall II, a Democrat, in West Virginiaâ€™s Third District, said in a typical statement. â€œDo you think the Muslims would allow a Jewish temple or Christian church to be built in Mecca?â€\\x9d
 Republicans said Mr. Obamaâ€™s defense of the right of the developers to pursue the project showed that he was out of touch with average Americans.
 â€œIt is very troubling to see President Obama again turning a deaf ear to the thoughts and concerns of a majority of Americans,â€\\x9d said James Renacci, a Republican candidate in Ohioâ€™s 16th District, who said people at a recent public meeting were furious about the mosque proposal.
 The remarks were a rare instance in this campaign season when Republicans have strayed from a focus on economic issues in their push for substantial gains in the House and Senate in November. The intensity of their attacks showed that they do not appear worried about the risk of being seen as intolerant or not supportive of the right to freedom of religion.
 Some leading Democrats said it was the presidentâ€™s role to stand up for constitutional rights in the mosque dispute.
 Representative James E. Clyburn, the No. 3 House Democrat, said Monday that â€œarticulating the constitutional principlesâ€\\x9d on which the country was founded and â€œcalling for tolerance on the part of all of its peopleâ€\\x9d were part of â€œa presidential act worth exercising.â€\\x9d
 Privately, many Democrats were not pleased that the issue had been thrown into their laps during the summer recess as they believed they had been making inroads by talking about how some Republicans support privatizing Social Security. But strategists said Democrats could counter the Republican offensive by labeling the mosque dispute as a local issue and saying Democrats remain focused on the economy.
 Some also said the White House should not have put lawmakers on the spot in the first place and could have been better prepared for the presidentâ€™s statement, lining up religious and community leaders to offer support for the right to build the mosque and undermine Republican attacks.
 Other Democrats said they did not see the fight resonating strongly outside New York and did not expect it to become a defining campaign issue.
 Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat who represents the district that includes ground zero, said he doubted that the fight over the mosque would inflict much damage on fellow Democrats in the November elections.
 Mr. Nadler, whose view is that the developers were entitled to build the mosque at the selected location if they choose, said, â€œUltimately I suspect that once this simmers down in a few weeks, people will realize that everybodyâ€™s liberty is at stake here.â€\\x9d
 The planned community center, perhaps 15 stories tall, would be built in three adjacent buildings two blocks north of ground zero, though one building, owned by Consolidated Edison, has yet to be sold. The other two are all but vacant now; worship services are already taking place in one of them.
 The developer, Sharif el-Gamal, a real estate investor born in New York, has said the center would include meeting rooms, a prayer space, a 500-seat auditorium and a pool. Two mosques, founded in 1970 and 1985, are already within several blocks of the proposed center. They are so busy and crowded that a search was begun for more space.
 Before Mr. Obama spoke out, leading Republican figures like Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House, and Sarah Palin, the partyâ€™s 2008 vice-presidential nominee, had been voicing opposition to the Islamic center. That caused other Republicans to warn that the party risked a backlash and was alienating the nationâ€™s Muslims.
 But Mr. Gingrich showed no sign of backing down on Monday. â€œNazis donâ€™t have the right to put up a sign next to the Holocaust Museum in Washington,â€\\x9d Mr. Gingrich said on the Fox News program â€œFox and Friends.â€\\x9d â€œWe would never accept the Japanese putting up a site next to Pearl Harbor. Thereâ€™s no reason for us to accept a mosque next to the World Trade Center.â€\\x9d
 Democratic campaign officials accused Republicans of exploiting the Sept. 11 attacks, noting that their outrage over the Islamic center came just weeks after many House Republicans opposed a new medical program to monitor and treat emergency workers and others suffering ill effects from exposure to hazardous materials at ground zero.

TITLE: White House Asked Bill Clinton to Urge Sestak to Drop Out of Senate Race

PUBLISHED: 2010/05/28

The White House asked former President Bill Clinton to talk to Rep. Joe Sestak about the possibility of obtaining a senior position in the Obama administration if he would drop out of the Democratic primary race against establishment-backed Sen. Arlen Specter, the Obama administration said in a report released Friday morning.
 But the report, by White House Counsel Robert Bauer, concluded that "allegations of improper conduct rest on factual errors and lack a basis in the law."
 Batting down allegations that the White House dangled the secretary of Navy position in front of Sestak, the report said that Sestak was offered executive branch positions on advisory boards that were uncompensated.
 One of the jobs Clinton specifically discussed with Sestak was the president's intelligence advisory board. But a White House official said the plan always was for Sestak to remain in the House, and he couldn't have served in the House and on the president's intelligence advisory board.
 The report also described the Clinton conversations as informal and not tied to any precise job offer since, as a former president, Clinton could not guarantee Sestak anything.
 Clinton initiated conversations with Sestak at the behest of White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, who was Clinton's political director when he was president. As president, Clinton promoted Sestak to vice admiral and made him his director of defense policy. Sestak was also a loyal and tireless supporter of Hillary Clinton's run for the presidency in 2008.
 At hastily arranged news conference Friday afternoon, Sestak said Clinton called him last summer to express concerns over his jumping into the Senate primary, and how his military background could help him leave a mark on the House.
 Sestak said he almost interrupted Clinton to tell him Clinton that "I am going to decide to get into this or not only depending upon what's good for Pennsylvania's working families and not an offer. And he said 'I knew you'd say that,'" before the conversation moved on to other subjects.
 The White House report disputed any suggestion that there was "impropriety" in Clinton's discussion with Sestak over possible alternatives to his Senate candidacy.
 "There have been numerous, reported instances in the past when prior administrations -- both Democratic and Republican, and motivated by the same goals -- discussed alternative paths to service for qualified individuals also considering campaigns for public office," the report read. "Such discussions are fully consistent with the relevant law and ethical requirements."
 The report comes one day after President Obama insisted "nothing improper" happened with Sestak. On that same day, Obama had lunch with Clinton.
 "This is punishable by prison. This is a felony," said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., who has been leading the charge for more details on the allegation.
 "This is about the White House. This is not about Congressman Sestak," Issa said, adding that he wants to know what Clinton was empowered to say. "They've answered a question and it begs many more answers," he said. "We want elections not to be appointments."
 Sestak's opponent in the general election for the Senate seat, Republican Pat Toomey, questioned why it took so long for this explanation.
 "If this explanation is as innocent as it looks, I sure don't know why it took three months to say so," Toomey said in a statement. "As I've said many times, this job offer issue is not my focus, and it's not where Pennsylvanians want the focus of the campaign to be."
 Critics say the Sestak job offer may have violated the part of the U.S. code that says: "Whoever, directly or indirectly, promises any employment, position, compensation...appointment...provided for or made possible in whole or in part by any Act of Congress...to any person as consideration, favor, or reward for any political activity...or in connection with any primary election ...shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both."

TITLE: Richard Blumenthal's Words on Vietnam Service Differ From History

PUBLISHED: 2010/05/17

At a ceremony honoring veterans and senior citizens who sent presents to soldiers overseas, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut rose and spoke of an earlier time in his life.
 â€œWe have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam,â€\\x9d Mr. Blumenthal said to the group gathered in Norwalk in March 2008. â€œAnd you exemplify it. Whatever we think about the war, whatever we call it â€” Afghanistan or Iraq â€” we owe our military men and women unconditional support.â€\\x9d
 There was one problem: Mr. Blumenthal, a Democrat now running for the United States Senate, never served in Vietnam. He obtained at least five military deferments from 1965 to 1970 and took repeated steps that enabled him to avoid going to war, according to records.
 The deferments allowed Mr. Blumenthal to complete his studies at Harvard; pursue a graduate fellowship in England; serve as a special assistant to The Washington Postâ€™s publisher, Katharine Graham; and ultimately take a job in the Nixon White House.
 In 1970, with his last deferment in jeopardy, he landed a coveted spot in the Marine Reserve, which virtually guaranteed that he would not be sent to Vietnam. He joined a unit in Washington that conducted drills and other exercises and focused on local projects, like fixing a campground and organizing a Toys for Tots drive.
 Many politicians have faced questions over their decisions during the Vietnam War, and Mr. Blumenthal, who is seeking the seat being vacated by Senator Christopher J. Dodd, is not alone in staying out of the war.
 But what is striking about Mr. Blumenthalâ€™s record is the contrast between the many steps he took that allowed him to avoid Vietnam, and the misleading way he often speaks about that period of his life now, especially when he is speaking at veteransâ€™ ceremonies or other patriotic events.
 Sometimes his remarks have been plainly untrue, as in his speech to the group in Norwalk. At other times, he has used more ambiguous language, but the impression left on audiences can be similar.
 In an interview on Monday, the attorney general said that he had misspoken about his service during the Norwalk event and might have misspoken on other occasions. â€œMy intention has always been to be completely clear and accurate and straightforward, out of respect to the veterans who served in Vietnam,â€\\x9d he said.
 But an examination of his remarks at the ceremonies shows that he does not volunteer that his service never took him overseas. And he describes the hostile reaction directed at veterans coming back from Vietnam, intimating that he was among them.
 In 2003, he addressed a rally in Bridgeport, where about 100 military families gathered to express support for American troops overseas. â€œWhen we returned, we saw nothing like this,â€\\x9d Mr. Blumenthal said. â€œLet us do better by this generation of men and women.â€\\x9d
 At a 2008 ceremony in front of the Veterans War Memorial Building in Shelton, he praised the audience for paying tribute to troops fighting abroad, noting that America had not always done so.
 â€œI served during the Vietnam era,â€\\x9d he said. â€œI remember the taunts, the insults, sometimes even physical abuse.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Blumenthal, 64, is known as a brilliant lawyer who likes to argue cases in court and uses language with power and precision. He is also savvy about the news media and attentive to how he is portrayed in the press.
 But the way he speaks about his military service has led to confusion and frequent mischaracterizations of his biography in his home state newspapers. In at least eight newspaper articles published in Connecticut from 2003 to 2009, he is described as having served in Vietnam.
 The New Haven Register on July 20, 2006, described him as â€œa veteran of the Vietnam War,â€\\x9d and on April 6, 2007, said that the attorney general had â€œserved in the Marines in Vietnam.â€\\x9d On May 26, 2009, The Connecticut Post, a Bridgeport newspaper that is the stateâ€™s third-largest daily, described Mr. Blumenthal as â€œa Vietnam veteran.â€\\x9d The Shelton Weekly reported on May 23, 2008, that Mr. Blumenthal â€œwas met with applause when he spoke about his experience as a Marine sergeant in Vietnam.â€\\x9d
 And the idea that he served in Vietnam has become such an accepted part of his public biography that when a national outlet, Slate magazine, produced a profile of Mr. Blumenthal in 2000, it said he had â€œenlisted in the Marines rather than duck the Vietnam draft.â€\\x9d
 It does not appear that Mr. Blumenthal ever sought to correct those mistakes.
 In the interview, he said he was not certain whether he had seen the stories or whether any steps had been taken to point out the inaccuracies.
 â€œI donâ€™t know if we tried to do so or not,â€\\x9d he said. He added that he â€œcanâ€™t possibly know what is reported in allâ€\\x9d the articles that are written about him, given the large number of appearances he makes at military-style events.
 He said he had tried to stick to a consistent way of describing his military experience: that he served as a member of the United State Marine Corps Reserve during the Vietnam era.
 Asked about the Bridgeport rally, when he told the crowd, â€œWhen we returned, we saw nothing like this,â€\\x9d Mr. Blumenthal said he did not recall the event.

TITLE: Double-Dip Recession Possible Without Tax Deal, Obama's Top Economic Aide Warns

PUBLISHED: 2010/12/08

Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned Wednesday that failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would significantly raise the risk of a double-dip recession.
 "To pass this bill in the next couple of weeks would materially increase the risk that the economy would stall out and we would have a double dip," he told reporters at the White House.
 Summers added that he thinks Congress will pass the deal President Obama struck with Republicans, an agreement that has come under withering criticism from liberal Democrats over the two-year extension of tax cuts for the rich as well as the middle class.
 Summers said that he doesn't think that Congress would take a step that "materially increases the risk that this economy will stall out."
 Positive reviews coming in from economists, Summers said, show the deal is the right thing to do.
 Sen. Jon Kyl, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, told reporters that a tax cut bill could be on the Senate floor as early as Thursday.
 But, in a surprise move, Senate Democrats, meeting behind closed doors to discuss the tax deal, have asked the administration for "changes" to the bill, according to Sen Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber. Durbin would not detail what those changes are, deferring to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.
 Kyl said an official analysis and price tag, referred to as a "score," from the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) are not yet ready, but that the Senate could move to the bill anyway.
 Vice President Biden traveled to the Capitol Wednesday for a private meeting with House Democrats who are resisting the deal, saying it gives away too much to the wealthy.
 Some Democrats are unhappy that Obama agreed to extend expiring tax cuts not just for the middle class but also for higher earners, and that he agreed to impose a lower estate tax on wealthy heirs. Both provisions are seen by many Democrats as giveaways to the rich that will do little to help the economy.
 In return, Democrats would get extended jobless benefits for people who have been unemployed for long stretches. Workers would also see their share of Social Security payroll taxes cut by nearly a third for the coming year, a boost in take-home pay meant to encourage spending and aid the economy.
 Liberals are going as far as trying to prevent outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from bringing the tax cut compromise to the floor.
 Reps. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, and Jim McDermott and Jay Inslee of Washington state are crafting a letter to share with the House Democratic Caucus that would try to block the bill from seeing the light of day. They're hoping to get 60 signatures on their letter and then force a vote in the caucus.
 "There does not seem to be a majority of the Democrats who support the deal negotiated by Vice President Biden," he told Fox News. "So we want to have a record vote in the caucus on a resolution that says this resolution should not go to the floor without a majority of Democratic votes."
 DeFazio said House Democrats aren't going to keep rubber-stamping deals they don't like.
 "All through this administration, the White House has been a spear carrier for the president," he said. "They sent something over, the speaker has jammed it through and then Obama has negotiated with the Senate. And they're trying to get us to jam it through again. And a number of us are just saying that's enough."
 Obama rejected claims that he betrayed Democrats by cutting a deal with Republicans. Speaking to reporters at a joint appearance with Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski, Obama said economists predict higher job growth in 2011 and 2012 if Congress passes the agreement and urged lawmakers to examine the details of the deal and "get this done."
 But House Democrats are not listening.
 "So far, the response has not been very good," Pelosi said. She called the estate tax provision "a bridge too far."

TITLE: RNC Chairman Steele to Announce Intentions on a Second Term

PUBLISHED: 2010/12/12

Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele will speak with RNC members Monday evening in which he is expected to announce a decision about whether to make another run for the party chairmanship. A handful of well-placed and influential RNC insiders tell Fox News they expect Steele to announce he is not running for re-election.
 But Steele has been unpredictable, especially over recent weeks, and some close to the GOP chairman say he wants to run for another term and is struggling to find enough support for a second term.
 Fox News confirmed Steele sent an e-mail to committee members Saturday night with the subject line, "conference call."
 In the note, he asked members to join him "for a private conference call" Monday evening.
 Republicans picked up 63 seats in the House, narrowed the gap in the Senate and picked up 19 state legislative bodies in the November midtem election, but pressure has been mounting all year for Steele to step down from the position.
 Critics have described the chairman as gaffe-prone and said he hasn't raised enough money. The criticism has resulted in an array of challenges or potential challenges for Steele's job from Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Reince Priebus, former RNC Co-Chairwoman Ann Wagner, longtime Republican official Maria Cino, former Michigan Republican Party Chairman Saul Anuzis and former RNC Political Director Gentry Collins.
 The fierce competition will end next month with the selection of a chairman for the 2012 election cycle.

TITLE: Glenn Beck CPAC 2010 Speech VIDEO: Republicans Don't Need A Big Tent

PUBLISHED: 2010/02/20

Glenn Beck CPAC 2010 Speech VIDEO: Republicans Don't Need A Big Tent
 Bombastic conservative talk show host Glenn Beck closed a three-day conservative conference on Saturday by demanding that Republicans get their own house in order before re-trying their hand at governance.
 In a winding speech that touched as much on his personal turmoil as his policies and politics, Beck had the packed auditorium at CPAC captivated from the start. Using hand gestures, multiple impersonations and his infamous chalkboard, he took the usual swipes at Democrats. "Progressivism," he declared, "is eating the Constitution." Moreover, it "was designed to eat the Constitution."
 But the nearly hour-long address was spent not bemoaning his ideological foes, but rather demanding purity among his likely allies. If last year's CPAC keynote speech - delivered by radio host Rush Limbaugh - was defined by urging President Barack Obama to fail, Beck's stood out for his demand that conservatism succeed.
 "Dick Cheney a couple days ago... says it is going to be a good year for conservative ideas," he declared at one point, wiping the sweat from his brow. "It is going to be a very good year. But it is not enough just to not suck as much as the other side."
 And who, exactly, sucked as much as the other side? Beck didn't really name names - save for a swipe at one Republican (presumably Sen. John McCain) for admiring another Republican, Teddy Roosevelt -- the latter of whom Beck accused of launching the modern progressive movement. But the message was clear: supporting anything that closely resembled the Democratic agenda would no longer fly with the modern GOP.
 "I have not heard people in the Republican Party admit yet that they have a problem," he said. "I haven't seen the Come-To-Jesus moment from Republicans yet."
 "One party will tax and spend," he added at another point. 'One party won't tax and will spend. It is both of them together."
 The plea was made all the more effective by the intertwining of Beck's own story of struggle and redemption. Pointing to his time as a recovering alcoholic, the Fox News host urged the GOP to embark on a 12-step program of recovery. "Hello, my name is the Republican Party, and I got a problem. I'm addicted to spending and big government," he declared, reading out the apology he wanted lawmakers to deliver. Reflecting on his own lack of formal education, he railed against government handouts - extending the logic to argue against a right to health care.
 The crowd was enthralled, even as Beck took them down winding tales of Calvin Coolidge, the Statute of Liberty and the supposed great middle class explosion of the 1920s.
 But was the message what the conservative movement needed to hear? Tradition dictates that political parties out of power do what they can to expand their coalition. Elections, after all, are won when candidates broaden their appeal to the voters responsible for electing them. For Beck and the surrounding CPAC crowd, however, ideological purity was the path to redemption and recovery.
 All we've heard, the Fox News host complained, is "we need a big tent. We need a big tent. Can we get a bigger tent? How can we get a big tent? What is this the circus? America is not a clown show. America is not a circus. America is an idea. America is an idea that sets people free."

TITLE: White House Used Bill Clinton to Ask Sestak to Drop Out of Race

PUBLISHED: 2010/05/27

President Obamaâ€™s chief of staff used former President Bill Clinton as an intermediary to see if Representative Joe Sestak would drop out of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s Democratic Senate primary if given a prominent, but unpaid, advisory position, the White House said on Friday.
 Rahm Emanuel, the chief of staff, asked Mr. Clinton last summer to explore â€œoptions of serviceâ€\\x9d on a presidential or senior government advisory board with Mr. Sestak, the White House said in a statement. Mr. Sestak said no and went on to win last weekâ€™s primary against Senator Arlen Specter.
 The White House disputed Republican claims that the conversations might be illegal or improper. â€œThere was no such impropriety,â€\\x9d Robert F. Bauer, the White House counsel, said in a memo released to reporters. â€œThe Democratic Party leadership had a legitimate interest in averting a divisive primary fight and a similarly legitimate concern about the congressman vacating his seat in the House.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Bauer went on to say that such horse-trading has been commonplace through history. â€œThere have been numerous, reported instances in the past when prior administrations â€“ both Democratic and Republican, and motivated by the same goals â€“ discussed alternative paths to service for qualified individuals also considering campaigns for public office,â€\\x9d he wrote. â€œSuch discussions are fully consistent with the relevant law and ethical requirements.â€\\x9d
 Representative Darrell Issa of California, the senior Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said the interactions described by the White House â€œrepresent an illegal quid pro quo,â€\\x9d even if the position was unpaid. â€œIt is abundantly clear that this kind of conduct is contrary to President Obamaâ€™s pledge to change â€™business as usualâ€™ and that his administration has engaged in the kind of political shenanigans he once campaigned to end.â€\\x9d
 Federal law makes it a crime for anyone â€œwho directly or indirectly, promises any employment, position, compensation, contract, appointment, or any other benefitâ€\\x9d to someone else â€œas consideration, favor, or reward for any political activity or for the support of or opposition to any candidate or any political party in connection with any general or special election to any political office.â€\\x9d It is also illegal for a government official to use â€œhis official authority for the purpose of interfering with, or affecting, the nomination or the election of any candidateâ€\\x9d for Senate.
 While many have speculated that the White House offered to appoint Mr. Sestak as secretary of the Navy, Mr. Bauer said that was never the case. The White House did not offer Mr. Sestak a full-time paid position because Mr. Emanuel wanted him to stay in the House rather than risk losing his seat, so he considered â€œuncompensated advisory board options.â€\\x9d
 The White House did not disclose what those options were, but people briefed on the matter said one option was an appointment to the presidentâ€™s Intelligence Advisory Board, a panel of prominent Americans outside government who provide independent oversight of the nationâ€™s spy apparatus and advise the president. But White House officials discovered that it would not work because Mr. Sestak could not serve on the board while still serving in Congress.
 In a statement Friday, Mr. Sestak said Mr. Clinton had conveyed Mr. Emanuelâ€™s suggestion that he join a â€œpresidential boardâ€\\x9d while remaining in the House, but he declined. â€œI told President Clinton that my only consideration in getting into the Senate race or not was whether it was the right thing to do for Pennsylvania working families and not any offer,â€\\x9d Mr. Sestak said. â€œThe former president said he knew Iâ€™d say that, and the conversation moved on to other subjects.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Sestak first mentioned publicly in February that he had been offered a job but provided no details, and the White House for three months had refused to discuss it, generating intense criticism from Republicans who accused it of trying to bribe a congressman and deep consternation among Democrats who called on the administration to answer questions.
 Mr. Emanuel was eager last summer to clear the way to this yearâ€™s Democratic Senate nomination for Mr. Specter, who had just left the Republican party, and to bolster Democratsâ€™ majority in the Senate. Mr. Sestak, a retired admiral and two-term House member, was already planning a run.
 In tapping Mr. Clinton as the go-between, Mr. Emanuel picked the partyâ€™s most prominent figure other than Mr. Obama and someone Mr. Sestak had worked for on the National Security Council in the 1990s. Mr. Sestak endorsed Hillary Rodham Clinton against Mr. Obama in the 2008 presidential primaries, and Mr. Clinton was one of the first to call to congratulate him on his Senate victory last week.
 Mr. Clinton was at the White House on Thursday to have lunch with Mr. Obama and join him in greeting the American menâ€™s World Cup soccer team heading to South Africa.
 As chief of staff and previously as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Mr. Emanuel has not been shy about trying to steer party nominations to those he considers the stronger candidates. The White House under Mr. Emanuel has also leaned on Gov. David Paterson of New York to drop out of this yearâ€™s gubernatorial race, which he eventually did under a cloud of scandal. Mr. Emanuelâ€™s deputy, Jim Messina, suggested a possible administration job to Andrew Romanoff to get him to not challenge Sen. Michael Bennet in a Colorado primary, The Denver Post has reported, citing unnamed sources.
 Whether that constitutes ordinary political horse-trading or crosses a legal line has been debated in Washington for months. Democrats and some Republicans have said it is hardly unusual for presidents to offer political appointments to clear the way for allies. But Republicans have suggested such actions may constitute a crime.
 Mr. Issa and all seven Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee have asked the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor. The Justice Department wrote Mr. Issa last week that it did not need a special prosecutor to investigate if it chose to do so. Government officials, who asked not to be identified discussing legal decisions, said that neither the Justice Department nor the Office of Special Counsel, an agency that looks at violations of the Hatch Act governing the political conduct of federal employees, is investigating.
 While declining to discuss what happened, Mr. Obama on Thursday said, â€œI can assure the public that nothing improper took place.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Biden Tries, Again, to Sell Tax Compromise to Hill Democrats

PUBLISHED: 2010/12/08

Larry Summers, the outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, just told a group of reporters that failure to pass a package like the tax deal announced by President Obama this week â€œwould significantly increase the riskâ€\\x9d of a double-dip recession.
 Mr. Summers made the remarks at a briefing with the White House press secretary Robert Gibbs and David Axelrod, the presidentâ€™s top political adviser. The administration has been pushing back hard against criticism from fellow Democrats that the president has caved too much to Republicans.
 In brief remarks after meeting with President Bronislaw Komorowski of Poland, Mr. Obama on Wednesday emphatically disputed that Democrats generally feel betrayed by his deal with Congressional Republicans on the tax cuts, saying that â€œthe more who look at it, the more will say this makes sense.â€\\x9d
 â€œI just think itâ€™s very important for Congress to examine the agreement, look at the facts, have a thorough debate, but get this done. The American people are watching, and theyâ€™re expecting action on our parts,â€\\x9d Mr. Obama said. â€œI donâ€™t think we need to translate that.â€\\x9d
 In a joint appearance at the White House with Mr. Komorowski, Mr. Obama said that â€œeconomists across the country have upwardly revised their forecasts for growthâ€\\x9d after the tax deal was announced on Monday night.
 Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. planned to return to Capitol Hill this afternoon to meet with House Democrats as President Obama and the White House sought to quell the uproar among liberals about the tax deal.
 Officials said Mr. Biden will travel to the Hill around 4:30 p.m. in an attempt to sell the compromise Mr. Obama announced this week. It will be the second time in two days that Mr. Biden has served as the liaison-in-chief for the White House.
 Mr. Bidenâ€™s visit and the presidentâ€™s comments come as the administrationâ€™s message machine started churning out statements of support.
 To counter condemnations from some Democrats in Congress, the White House circulated a series of e-mails quoting endorsements from private-sector economic forecasters, liberal as well as conservative analysts, and Democratic officeholders, including an obscure freshman House member, Representative Gary Peters of Michigan.
 By noon, the White House press office had released supportive comments from Antonio Villaraigosa, the mayor of Los Angeles, and Mr. Peters. The Democratic National Committee alerted reporters that Jennifer Granholm, the Democratic governor of Michigan, also supports the deal.
 John Podesta, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton and a close ally of Mr. Obama, issued a statement calling the tax deal â€œa steep priceâ€\\x9d but saying the president was â€œright to choose helping working Americans over a December conflagration.â€\\x9d  The Democratic National Committee also sent that statement around to reporters.
 David Axelrod, the presidentâ€™s chief political adviser, said on CNNâ€™s â€œAmerican Morningâ€\\x9d that middle-class Americans were â€œgoing to get screwedâ€\\x9d if their tax cuts were not extended at the end of the year.
 The administration was quick to highlight comments from Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moodyâ€™sEconomy.com, projecting that the Obama tax deal would increase economic growth next year by 1.25 percentage points and create 1.6 million jobs. Macroeconomic Advisors, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs projected smaller increases but no less than at least 0.5 percentage point. That is on top of projections that currently are in the range of 2 percent to 3 percent.
 But the public relations offensive is being met with public expressions of outrage from Mr. Obamaâ€™s base, including the most liberal members of Congress and spokesmen for interest groups on the left.
 Close to three dozen House Democrats have signed a letter from Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, calling the tax deal â€œfiscally irresponsibleâ€\\x9d and â€œgrossly unfair.â€\\x9d The letter says Mr. Obama â€œshould not back down. Nor should we.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Bidenâ€™s visit with the House Democrats is likely to be as contentious as the one that he led with their Senate colleagues on Tuesday â€” if not more so.
 Despite the closed-door lunchtime meeting, Senate aides told The Times afterward that about 30 Democratic senators remained â€œfirmly opposedâ€\\x9d to the presidentâ€™s negotiated deal after hearing from the vice president.
 In the House, Democratic lawmakers said Wednesday morning that the sense of disappointment with the president remained strong.
 â€œI donâ€™t think it was preordained that if we had a deadlock, they would have won it,â€\\x9d said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, in an interview on MSNBC. â€œIâ€™m not going to vote for it. I donâ€™t feel that I should be coerced.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Steele to Announce Decision on R.N.C. Run

PUBLISHED: 2010/12/12

The battle for control of the Republican National Committee will take a new turn on Monday when Michael Steele announces whether he plans to step down as party chairman or will disregard the onslaught of criticism about his oversight of the committee and seek a second term.
 Mr. Steele is expected to disclose his intentions during a conference call with committee members on Monday evening. Mr. Steele has lost the backing of many top supporters, but he has not yet said whether he will try to rebuild his frayed coalition and fight for the chance to lead the party into the 2012 election cycle.
 Mr. Steeleâ€™s tenure has been one of the few blemishes this year for the Republican Party, which scored historic victories in the midterm elections. At least six top Republicans have already taken steps to run for party chairman and several members have withdrawn their support for Mr. Steele, leading many party leaders to conclude that Mr. Steele will not seek reelection.
 But Mr. Steele has kept close counsel about his future, Republican officials said Sunday, and his plans were unknown even to several of his own advisers. A spokesman for the R.N.C. did not respond to inquiries about the conference call, which Mr. Steele announced personally in a weekend e-mail message to fellow Republicans.
 â€œDear Members, Please join me for a private conference call,â€\\x9d Mr. Steele wrote in a message to Republicans, which was provided to the New York Times by a committee member. â€œThank you and I look forward to talking to you Monday evening.â€\\x9d
 A coordinated effort to replace Mr. Steele has been underway for weeks, with several leading Republicans arguing that the committee needed to urgently improve its fund-raising practices and tighten its organizational structure to prepare for the presidential election. The political director of the committee resigned in protest last month and is among those vying for the job.
 Mr. Steele, a former lieutenant governor of Maryland, was elected in January 2009 to lead Republicans at a bleak moment. He has argued that he deserves credit for building the party in all corners of the country and winning control of the House of Representatives last month.
 The contenders for the position include: Reince Preibus, chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party; Ann Wagner of Missouri, an ambassador to Luxembourg in the Bush administration; Maria Cino, a veteran Republican operative who has the support of former Vice President Dick Cheney; Saul Anuzis, former Republican chairman in Michigan; and Gentry Collins, who resigned last month as political director. A former party chairman, Mike Duncan, also is considering a run.
 The 168-member committee will elect a chairman during its meeting in January.

TITLE: Michael Steele's End Could Be Near

PUBLISHED: 2010/12/13

RNC Chairman Michael Steele is expected by some to announce that he will not seek a second term as the head of the Republican National Committee, according to multiple reports.
 Politico reported over the weekend that many of his supporters as well as other GOP operatives believe that a Steele run was looking increasingly doubtful, due in part to the fact that he "has built no known reelection team or structure, making the prospect of a campaign unlikely in the face of competition that grows fiercer by the day."
 Meanwhile, multiple sources tell Fox News that they believe Steele will drop out of the race.
 And while many predict that Steele will call it quits after his current term, his increasing seclusion and detachment from other Republican advisers has made his forthcoming decision difficult to ascertain. At least one GOP insider who had direct contact with Steele told the Washington Post that the chairman would indeed be seeking another term atop the RNC.
 Hotline On Call says the nature of the decision is a "closely guarded secret" and reports that "even his top advisors, both inside and outside the committee, say they don't know which direction he will take."
 Steele's gaffe-prone tenure at the helm of the RNC has aided the creation of a significant bloc of GOPers who are intent on seeing his departure next month. While some, such as black conservative group BOND Action, have directly announced their intentions to work toward insuring Steele's termination at the committee, other Republicans have simply lined up behind his growing list of challengers.
 Maria Cino, a former Bush official who recently received key backing from former RNC Chairman Ed Gillespie and former Vice President Dick Cheney, became the latest official contender this weekend.
 Wisconsin GOP Chairman Reince Preibus, recently resigned RNC political director Gentry Collins, former U.S. ambassador Ann Wagner and former Michigan GOP chairman Saul Anuzis also round out the list. Politico also reports that former Senator Norm Coleman could enter the race if Steele decides not to run.

TITLE: Senate Republicans: No Legislation Until After Tax Cut Extension

PUBLISHED: 2010/12/01

Democrats in the Senate hoping to pass nonbudget-related legislation in the lame-duck session were put on notice by their Republican colleagues Wednesday morning: No tax-cut extension? No laws for you!
 In a letter signed by the 42 members of the Republican caucus, delivered to the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, and mentioned Wednesday on the Senate floor by the minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republicans informed their Democratic counterparts that they would not go forward with â€œany legislative item until the Senate has acted to fund the government and we have prevented the tax increase that is currently awaiting all American taxpayers.â€\\x9d
 The letter goes on: â€œWith little time left in this Congressional session, legislative scheduling should be focused on these critical priorities.  While there are other items that might ultimately be worthy of the Senateâ€™s attention, we cannot agree to prioritize any matters above the critical issues of funding the government and preventing a job-killing tax hike.â€\\x9d
 Washington is locked in a battle over what to do about the Bush-era tax cuts, which expire at the end of the year.  President Obama and Democratic lawmakers want to extend the cuts to all Americans except those with income above $250,000, while Republicans want tax cuts extended to Americans at all income levels.  Another idea that has been kicking around over the last few weeks â€” proposed by some Democrats â€” is raising the expiration income ceiling to households with at least $1 million in income.
 At the same time, Congress needs to make a legislative move to keep the government funded before the 112th Congress takes over in January.
 Democrats were hoping to force a more ambitious agenda into the final weeks, including the ratification of the New Start treaty, a military authorization bill that would repeal the â€œdonâ€™t ask, donâ€™t tellâ€\\x9d provision, the extension of unemployment funds and the Dream Act, an immigration bill.
 â€œIf they really cared about creating jobs, they should stop blocking a preservation of unemployment insurance, which would create or save hundred of thousands of jobs,â€\\x9d Jim Manley, a spokesman for Mr. Reid, said in an e-mail.  â€œUnfortunately this letter is nothing new.  Republicans have simply put in writing their political strategy which they have pursued over the last two years: obstruct and delay action on critical matters, and then blame the Democrats for not addressing the needs of the American people.  This strategy is very cynical but very obvious and transparent.â€\\x9d
 This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:
 Correction: December 1, 2010
 Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this post said that Senator Harry Reid was from Arizona. He is from Nevada.
 Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, two of the strongest Republican critics of the Obama administrationâ€™s handling of the Benghazi attack, offered support nonetheless for the nomination of Victoria Nuland, who helped edit the much-disputed talking points about the incident.
 President Obama and Gov. Chris Christie, Republican of New Jersey, will reprise their pre-election tour of the coastal areas ravaged by Hurricane Sandy on Tuesday, a White House official said Friday morning.

TITLE: NAACP Condemns Tea Party Racism In Resolution

PUBLISHED: 2010/07/13

KANSAS CITY, Mo. â€” Leaders of the country's largest civil rights organization accused tea party activists on Tuesday of tolerating bigotry and approved a resolution condemning racism within the political movement.
 The resolution was adopted during the annual convention in Kansas City of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, spokesman Chris Fleming said. Tea party organizers disputed claims of racism and called on the NAACP to withdraw the resolution.
 Debate was mostly closed to the public, but the final version "calls on the tea party and all people of good will to repudiate the racist element and activities within the tea party," said Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP's Washington bureau.
 "I hope it will empower the tea party to actually look at itself and see that there are those who are noticing things that I think most tea partiers don't want," he said.
 Sarah Palin, a vocal tea party supporter, said in a statement late Tuesday that she was "saddened by the NAACP's claim that patriotic Americans ... are somehow 'racists.'" The former Alaska governor said claims that tea party activists "judge people by the color of their skin" were false and appalling.
 The final wording won't be released until the NAACP's national board of directors approves the resolution during its meeting in October. But the original called for the NAACP to "educate its membership and the community that this movement is not just about higher taxes and limited government." It said something could evolve "and become more dangerous for that small percentage of people that really think our country has been taken away from them."
 "We felt the time had come to stand up and say, 'It's time for the tea party to be responsible members of this democracy and make sure they don't tolerate bigots or bigotry among their members,'" NAACP President Ben Jealous said ahead of the debate.
 "We don't have a problem with the tea party's existence. We have an issue with their acceptance and welcoming of white supremacists into their organizations," he said.
 Tea party activist Alex Poulter, who co-founded a Kansas City-area group called Political Chips, also disputed the allegations. He said the movement is made up of a "diverse group of folks who are upset with what is going on with this country."
 Poulter said he has seen no evidence of racism within the movement.
 "It's unfounded, but people are running with these accusations like they are true," he said.
 A group called the St. Louis Tea Party issued its own resolution Tuesday calling on the NAACP to withdraw the proposal.
 Though not affiliated with either major political party, tea party activists espouse a political philosophy of less government, a free market, lower taxes, individual rights and political activism.
 The group has faced occasional claims of racism, most notably in March near the end of the bitter health care debate. U.S. Reps. John Lewis, Andre Carson and Emanuel Cleaver said some demonstrators, many of them tea party activists, yelled a racial epithet as the black congressmen walked from House office buildings to the Capitol. Cleaver, D-Mo., also said he was spit on.
 A white lawmaker said he also heard the epithets, but conservative activists said the lawmakers were lying.
 "They are pulling people together and focusing on the negative, and then it's hard to make anything positive out of that," said Anita L. Russell, president of the Kansas City, Mo., branch of the NAACP, which introduced the resolution. "And then these groups, these extremist groups, are looking for something, and they are latching on to this."

TITLE: Michael Steeleâ€™s Afghanistan Comments Stir Up Furious Reaction From Conservatives

PUBLISHED: 2010/07/04

Several prominent conservatives offered swift, negative reactions to Michael Steele on Friday, after the RNC chairman was caught on camera saying that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obamaâ€™s choosing.
 The pushback crested with Bill Kristol â€” still an influential voice among Republican lawmakers â€” writing a letter to Steele on his Weekly Standard site calling for the RNC leaderâ€™s resignation.
 â€œNeedless to say, the war in Afghanistan was not â€œa war of Obamaâ€™s choosing.â€\\x9d It has been prosecuted by the United States under Presidents Bush and Obama. Republicans have consistently supported the effort. Indeed, as the DNC Communications Director (of all people) has said, your statement â€œputs [you] at odds with about 100 percent of the Republican Party.
 And not on a trivial matter. At a time when Gen. Petraeus has just taken over command, when Republicans in Congress are pushing for a clean war funding resolution, when Republicans around the country are doing their best to rally their fellow citizens behind the mission, your comment is more than an embarrassment. Itâ€™s an affront, both to the honor of the Republican party and to the commitment of the soldiers fighting to accomplish the mission theyâ€™ve been asked to take on by our elected leaders.
 There are, of course, those who think we should pull out of Afghanistan, and theyâ€™re certainly entitled to make their case. But one of them shouldnâ€™t be the chairman of the Republican party.â€\\x9d
 Kristolâ€™s was the harshest of all the reactions to the Steele, whose spokesman, it should be noted, tried to clarify the comment by insisting that he merely meant that President Obama has not been forthcoming with a winning strategy.
 But the Weekly Standard editor was not alone.
 Another major neoconservative figure, Dan Senor, told the Huffington Post that Steeleâ€™s comments are â€œutterly irresponsible.â€\\x9d Senor, who served under the Bush administration as chief spokesman in Iraq and has been a major booster of efforts to escalate U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, noted that Steeleâ€™s RNC actually sponsored a conference call for his group to praise Obamaâ€™s Afghan surge last year.
 Indeed, even Steele himself declared back in December that Afghanistan is â€œâ€™a war we have to winâ€\\x9d â€” a far cry from the comments he made Thursday night, in which he said: â€œ...you donâ€™t do is engage in a land war in Afghanistan, alright, because everyone whoâ€™s tried over a thousand years of history has failed.â€\\x9d
 â€œItâ€™s completely inconsistent with this latest statement,â€\\x9d summarized Senor.
 In a bit of irony, Steeleâ€™s most recent comments have actually resonated among anti-war Democrats who share the skepticism that Afghanistan is a winnable enterprise. They also, in some respects, echo the opinions of some members of the conservative community (Joe Scarborough and George Will among them) who have been critical of the deployment of U.S. forces in that country.
 But Steele is not an anti-war Democrat. Nor is he a pundit. He is the figurehead of the Republican Party whose tenure, once again, seems shaky. Shortly after Kristol called for his resignation, a GOP operative began pitching the column to reporters, hoping that the meme of Steeleâ€™s troubles would spread far and wide.

TITLE: Glenn Beck Rips Progressivism at CPAC

PUBLISHED: 2010/02/20

Glenn Beck Rips Progressivism at CPAC
 Fox News host Glenn Beck, armed with his trademark chalkboard, blamed "progressivism" for America's problems Saturday in his keynote speech that brought the annual Conservative Political Action Conference to a close.
 The chalkboard, a prop that he uses frequently on his top-rated show, brought the audience to its feet. Beck wrote "Progressivism" on it to underscore his belief in what America is suffering from.
 When Beck asked what America is suffering from, someone shouted "President Obama," though Beck, an outspoken critic of the president, said it's "not that simple."
 Beck rejected the notion that the Republican Party should expand its tent to include progressives.
 "What is this? A circus?" he said, drawing laughter. "America is not a clown show. America is an idea that sets people free."
 Opening up about his troubled past, Beck told the crowd, "People need to understand that life is not fair. The bad guy sometimes wins."
 The speech capped three days of panel discussions and high-profile speakers, including numerous politicians mentioned as contenders for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. But for a lot of the CPAC attendees, Beck was the reason they came, as he is seen as a leader in the new conservative movement.
 The speech comes after a year in which Beck's growing popularity as a Fox News host coincided with the rise of the Tea Party Movement and populist rage directed at Washington. Beck also launched the 9/12 Project, which sets forth nine values and 12 principles that he believes the country was founded upon. The project inspired a major march in Washington in September.
 "This is how is America should be," said Cynthia Burgiss, 22, a student at the University of Dayton in Ohio who attended the 9/12 march in D.C. this year. "People of every race, political affiliation, religion came together for different reasons."
 She was at CPAC to see Beck and called him a "relatable ... everyday guy."
 "None of this would have happened without Glenn," she said.

TITLE: N.A.A.C.P. Challenges Tea Party on Racism

PUBLISHED: 2010/07/13

One of the nationâ€™s largest and oldest civil rights groups passed a resolution Tuesday calling for Tea Party groups to weed â€œracist elementsâ€\\x9d out of their ranks.
 Delegates at the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People approved the measure Tuesday in Kansas City.
 Benjamin Todd Jealous, the president of the N.A.A.C.P., said the resolution was not an attempt to label the entire Tea Party movement as racist. But he said the groups needed to do more to distance themselves from known hate groups that actively encourage their members to join the Tea Party.
 â€œTo this point, we have avoided calling them out and demanding them to be responsible,â€\\x9d Mr. Jealous said. â€œNow weâ€™re saying that with increased public attention, increased power, comes the responsibility to act responsibly.â€\\x9d
 He added: â€œKnowing that the consequence of silence is violence in these times, weâ€™re saying stand up and say enough is enough. They need to make clear that there is no place for the bigots in the Tea Party movement.â€\\x9d
 The resolution did not go over well with Tea Party groups and their supporters.
 Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, weighed in to defend the Tea Party movement on Monday when the resolution was proposed. On Fox Newsâ€™ â€œHannity,â€\\x9d she called on the Obamas to rebuke the N.A.A.C.P. and â€œset the record the straight.â€\\x9d
 The St. Louis Tea Party Coalition issued its own resolution against the N.A.A.C.P., accusing the civil rights body of acting as a â€œpartisan political attack dogâ€\\x9d and calling on the Internal Revenue Service to review the groupâ€™s tax-exempt status.
 The Tea Party movement has been beset with allegations of racism since black members of Congress preparing to vote on health care legislation accused protesters of hurling racial epithets, and in one instance, spitting on a congressman.
 Tea Party groups say there is no racism within the movement.

TITLE: Bob Etheridge Attacks Student: North Carolina Congressman Gets Rough With Interviewer

PUBLISHED: 2010/06/14

Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) appeared unreceptive to the question of an anonymous reporter this weekend, when he grabbed the self-identified â€œstudentâ€\\x9d after he asked the congressman if he â€œfully supported the Obama agenda.â€\\x9d
 In the video, the North Carolina lawmaker is seen approaching the camera, while the reporter asks, â€œHi, Congressman. How are you? Do you fully support the Obama agenda?â€\\x9d
 Etheridge appears visibly irritated and immediately asks, â€œwho are you?â€\\x9d before knocking the interviewerâ€™s camera to the ground.
 In the next shot, Etheridge grabs the reporterâ€™s wrist and continually asks him to identify himself. The cameraman replies, â€œweâ€™re just here for a project...weâ€™re just students.â€\\x9d
 Over at Big Government, a post accompanying the video provides the following commentary on the encounter:
 â€œExpect more of this. A hard, progressive left captured the Democrat majority in Congress and forced them to enact a fantasy grab-bag of legislation that is increasingly unpopular with the American public. Weâ€™re on the cusp of a deeper recession, millions of unemployed Americans have no prospect for work, taxes are about to spike higher and weâ€™ve maxed out the national credit card. The Democrats were given a chance to run government and theyâ€™ve only succeeded in running it into the ground. [...]
 Letâ€™s recap what we saw on this video. A sitting Congressman-a presumed living extension of James Madison and other founding fathers-was asked on a public street whether he supported the Presidentâ€™s agenda. His response was to hit away a video camera and assault a student. The age of Pericles this ainâ€™t.
 It is going to be a long, hot summer. But, youâ€™ve been given a target. Act accordingly.â€\\x9d
 Mediaite, in a response to the Big Government post, writes about the problems with anonymous inflammatory assault interviews, and argues that it might be this new brand of â€œjournalismâ€\\x9d that has Etheridge on edge:
 â€œNow, Etheridgeâ€™s actions are only partially defensible. He need not have gotten physical with the students who asked him the provocative question regarding his support of the â€œObama Agendaâ€\\x9d (honestly, that sort of opening question is straight from the Jason Mattera school of inflammatory interview techniques.)
 But little is known about these â€œstudents.â€\\x9d The YouTube video is published under an account titled TonyManization, and even more damning is that the faces of the individuals asking the Congressman questions are blurred out. Hmmm...nothing like the courage of the anonymous protester.
 Which brings us back to Etheridgeâ€™s response. Yeah - he comes off as a jerk, but...when in Rome. It will be interesting to follow how this story plays out in the news media. Will it be a big story? Probably not, but apparently being prepared for ambush interviews from eager college kids is the next phase of media training for many on Capitol Hill.â€\\x9d
 UPDATE:
 DNC spokesman Brad Woodhouse addressed the video in a statement Monday:
 â€œMotives matter, and I think you can see who was behind this,â€\\x9d Woodhouse said. â€œThis was a Republican party tracking operation. If it wasnâ€™t a party tracker or intern, why is the face blurred and why is the source hidden? You know if it had been a right wing blog, theyâ€™d identify themselves and theyâ€™d be booking this person on TV all day. Republicans know if they admit their involvement in this game of gotcha it will undermine their credibility. One minute this guy is interviewing a member of Congress on camera and the next a video is released with his face blurred out? If that doesnâ€™t tell you this is a Republican Party hatchet job nothing will.â€\\x9d
 UPDATE:
 Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-N.C.) has apologized for his combative behavior over the weekend in a statement released by his office:
 â€œI deeply and profoundly regret my reaction and I apologize to all involved,â€\\x9d Etheridge said. â€œThroughout my many years of service to the people of North Carolina, I have always tried to treat people from all viewpoints with respect. No matter how intrusive and partisan our politics can become, this does not justify a poor response. I have and I will always work to promote a civil public discourse.â€\\x9d

TITLE: N.C. Congressman Apologizes for Physical Confrontation With Man in Washington

PUBLISHED: 2010/06/14

Three days after an Internet video surfaced showing North Carolina Rep. Bob Etheridge in a physical confrontation with a young man, the lawmaker said he is "profoundly" sorry for the tussle on a Washington street.
 Etheridge, a Democrat, is seen in an amateur video grabbing the wrist and neck of an unidentified young man after the man approached the congressman and asked if he supported the "Obama agenda."
 "No matter how partisan and no matter how difficult things get sometimes, that's no excuse for my response," he added, shortly after releasing a written statement in which he said he "profoundly" regrets the incident.
 The video, posted to YouTube last Friday, shows the man, who appears to be in his early 20s and who identifies himself as a student, approaching Etheridge on the sidewalk.
 Etheridge is then seen trying to snatch a cell phone camera out of the student's hands. He then grabs the man's wrist and refuses to let go.
 "Who are you!" the seven-term congressman demands. "Tell me who you are ... I have a right to know who you are."
 Another man, not seen on camera, then tells Etheridge, "We're just here for a project."
 When the man asks Etheridge to "please let go of me," the congressman then grabs him by the neck.
 Etheridge told reporters that he hasn't apologized to the young men involved because "I dont know who they are."
 "I would if I knew who they were," he said.
 "I've been spat at, pushed and threatened before but that's no excuse," he added, saying that the incident occurred after a "long day."
 "His conduct is unbecoming of a member of Congress. It's bad enough that he's joined Obama's assault on North Carolina jobs, but his physical assault on a college student goes beyond the pale."
 Mike Flynn, a conservative blogger for biggovernment.com, wrote that the confrontation occurred last week outside a fundraiser headlined by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
 The video, which was posted on YouTube by "DCCameraGuy," does not reveal the identity of the men making the tape.
 Etheridge, who has represented North Carolina's 2nd Congressional District since 1997, is running for re-election against Republican Renee Ellmers, a registered nurse, in November. Political observers have predicted that the 68-year-old congressman will likely hold on to his seat.
 Etheridge, a member of the House Ways and Means and Budget committees, voted in favor of President Obama's health care overhaul legislation as well as the Democratic climate change bill known by opponents as cap-and-trade.

TITLE: Reid: Mosque Should Be Built Someplace Else

PUBLISHED: 2010/08/16

President Barack Obama's endorsement of the "Ground Zero mosque" during a speech on Friday night spurred some hope among supporters that a forceful case could be made for both the project's constitutionality and its larger geopolitical impact.
 That hope was short-lived. By Saturday, the president clarified that he was not speaking about the "wisdom" of the Islamic cultural center per se, just the right of the group to build the Cordoba House in downtown Manhattan.
 And on Monday the highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate officially came out against construction of the mosque in its current location
 "The First Amendment protects freedom of religion," reads a statement from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's office (D-Nev.). "Senator Reid respects that but thinks that the mosque should be built someplace else. If the Republicans are being sincere, they would help us pass this long overdue bill to help the first responders whose health and livelihoods have been devastated because of their bravery on 911, rather than continuing to block this much-needed legislation."
 Combined, Obama's clarification and Reid's opposition represent a double dose of bad news for progressives and even Republicans who believed that a strong case could be made in favor of Cordoba House. If anything, it's clearer now than it was last week (when Democrats were mostly silent on the matter) how deeply the party just wants this entire issue to go away. Reid, after all, only issued the above statement after his Republican opponents began hitting him for going silent on the matter.

TITLE: Larry Summers: If Tax Deal Goes Down There's A 'Significant Risk' Of A Double Dip Recession

PUBLISHED: 2010/12/08

Senior White House officials significantly raised the stakes on congressional Democrats in their efforts to get a deal passed on the Bush tax cuts, warning on Wednesday that inaction would "significantly increase the risk" of a double dip recession.
 It wasn't quite the metaphorical flare of mushroom cloud imagery, but outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers offered a fairly dire assessment of the stakes in the tax cut debate.
 "If they [Democrats] don't pass this bill in the next couple weeks it will materially increase the risk that the economy would stall out and we would have a double dip," he told a gathering of reporters at an off camera briefing.
 A double dip recession?
 "What I said it would significantly increase the risk," Summers replied.
 The message was hardly subtle. But it certainly was debatable. Summers himself, downplayed the significance of continuing the Bush tax cuts back in September -- though he was speaking, then, about the rates for the rich and the tax cut deal, at that point in time, did not include money for a 13-month extension of unemployment insurance or other tax incentives to help lower income workers.
 Asked whether the country would find itself dipping towards the economic doldrums if Congress waited a month or two to get a tax cut package passed, Rob Shapiro, a former commerce official in the Clinton White House and a proponent of the current tax cut deal, offered more sober-minded analysis.
 "The wait would not cause a double dip," he said. "A double dip would come out of the reality of a relatively contractionary fiscal policy... I do think the deal that they announced is stimulative. And it ought to boost growth by some increment... But the issue is, that the deal certainly is not enough to lift the economy to a different place. Will we see what happened with the large stimulus happen here, which is once the stimulus is over the economy returns to slow growth? That's the danger. And I keep on saying this, the single most important thing they can do to avert that is to stabilize housing prices."
 Stabilizing the housing market, however, is not on the current congressional docket. And on Wednesday, the White House began a robust process of selling the deal to Democrats -- skeptical, as they are, about an extension of Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and a generous revision of the estate tax.
 There were few carrots to go along with the sticks. Asked, for instance, if the White House would be willing to revise the informal compromise to bring more Democratic lawmakers on board, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said any changes would be fine, so long as they didn't result in decreased support. Then he cautioned: "The physics and the blood and the sweat that might be involved in that, I'm not entirely sure I would put it quite as simply as that."
 If anything, the pitch being offered from the administration to the rest of the party was: take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn.
 "I guess the question back for those who ask [why not fight for more] is where does this go, what is the end game and what are the consequences of playing it?" said senior adviser David Axelrod. "Do they have a sense of how this ends and how long will that take, because as Larry said there are real consequences to that. Just as the forecasts went up on the basis of this agreement they will go down if this agreement fails. That we know. We know that on January 1 people's taxes will go up, we know that at the end of this month 2 million people will lose their unemployment insurance. And so there are real consequences to that decision. We, I think we all stipulate, the president did, no one likes those provisions that they dislike but on the other side of the ledger are significant things that will help people and help the economy. And what we know for sure is that without any of it we are facing a really difficult situation."
 Added Gibbs: "I think you would really have to ask somebody who says... lets have some eight week fight and on February the 15th come in and say, alright, now we are ready to make a compromise, who on earth, who on earth thinks that that is somehow going to be a fundamentally better agreement than the one we are looking at right now? No one I have ever talked to."

TITLE: Senate Republicans Vow to Block Dem Legislation Until Tax Cuts, Budget Pass

PUBLISHED: 2010/12/01

Every Senate Republican has signed onto a letter vowing to block all Democratic-backed legislation until the chamber extends the Bush tax cuts and approves a spending bill to keep the government running, Fox News has learned.
 Throwing down the gauntlet, all 42 members of the GOP caucus are sending the letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid warning him that they will bring matters to a standstill unless he swiftly brings those tax-and-spending issues to the floor.
 That means putting on the backburner a push to repeal the military's policy banning gays from serving openly in the military, a bill giving illegal immigrant students and military members a pathway to legal status and an extension of long-term unemployment benefits.
 "While there are other items that might ultimately be worthy of the Senate's attention, we cannot agree to prioritize any matters above the critical issues of funding the government and preventing a job-killing tax hike," they wrote.  "Given our struggling economy, preventing the tax increase and providing economic certainty should be our top priority."
 "This strategy is very cynical but very obvious and transparent," he said in a statement.
 A panel of administration officials and bipartisan lawmakers is getting to work Wednesday to try to hash out a compromise over what to do about the expiring Bush tax cuts.  Democrats want them extended for all but the wealthy, while Republicans want them extended for everybody.
 President Obama met with top GOP and Democratic congressional leaders Tuesday but left the nitty-gritty negotiations to the panel -- he assigned Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and budget director Jacob Lew to represent the administration.  Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., the representative for Senate Democrats, indicated Wednesday he's not worried about the impact the GOP letter will have on the talks.
 "We have full confidence we're going to be able to handle all of this very well," he said.
 But with Republicans vowing to deprive Democrats of the 60 votes they need to move toward a vote on virtually anything until these issues are addressed, negotiators will have to move quickly if they want to get to other matters before a new, more Republican Congress is sworn in next month.
 The administration is still looking to repeal the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy after the Pentagon issued a report Tuesday claiming the policy shift would not harm the military in the long-run.
 Democrats also want to extend long-term jobless benefits, which expired Tuesday.  A memo circulated by a GOP analyst noted that Reid so far has not been able to peel off any Republicans to support the measure to give benefits beyond 99 weeks.
 The lame-duck Congress so far has approved a food safety bill, which still needs a final vote in the House, and a $4.5 billion settlement payment to black farmers and American Indians who claimed they were discriminated against by the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Interior.
 Lawmakers also passed a one-month extension of the "doc fix" that prevents cuts to Medicare approved 15 years ago from going into effect, but without action the rates paid to doctors for treating those insured by the entitlement program will plummet on Jan. 1.
 It's not just Republicans who are concerned about the way the lame-duck session became a dumping ground for campaign promises and wish-list legislation. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., was caught on a hot mic in the Senate ripping the lame-duck agenda, which was set exclusively by his party, as "rigged" and done without a discussion among members.
 Aside from the tax rates, lawmakers must pass this week a continuing resolution to keep the government functioning.  Election-harried Democrats opted against producing a budget at all this year, preferring to punt questions on tax rates and spending until after Nov. 2.  So, the government relies on a series of patches to keep operating. Similarly, lawmakers must vote on a supplemental appropriation to fund military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.
 The filibuster threat increases pressure on the White House to offer a more realistic agenda for the remaining weeks of the year.  For example, if Congress doesn't act on the tax cuts, it means Republicans will be in position to enact their own, retroactive plan starting Jan. 1 without having to make any concessions to Democratic demands for upper-income earners.

TITLE: Calling The Senate GOP's Bluff: Multiple Bills Likely To Come Up Before Tax Cuts

PUBLISHED: 2010/12/01

WASHINGTON -- The Senate GOP's threat to filibuster every single piece of legislation until the chamber resolves budget and tax cut measures will likely be tested as soon as Friday.
 On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) received a letter signed by all 42 Senate Republicans, which stated, "[W]e write to inform you that we will not agree to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to any legislative item until the Senate has acted to fund the government and we have prevented the tax increase that is currently awaiting all American taxpayers."
 But Reid plans to file cloture this week on at least three measures: the DREAM Act, collective bargaining for firefighters, and a 9/11 health bill. A senior Democratic staffer told The Huffington Post that it was likely to happen tonight or tomorrow. If it happens tonight, any of the bills could come before the Senate for a vote on proceeding to full debate as soon as Friday or possibly early next week.
 "It had been my intention to file cloture on both of these bills last evening," said Reid on the Senate floor on Tuesday, "however, supporters of the original bills requested that some modifications be made. These changes are reflected in the bills. I intend to move forward on both of these pieces of legislation. In addition, I intend to file cloture this week on the 9/11 health bill. I'll file cloture on all three of these at the same time."
 "We already have things on the calendar," said the Democratic staffer, noting that right now, it doesn't appear as if tax cuts will come before these measures that are already in the queue.
 There could be some cracks in the GOP coalition to stand firm against any non-budget or tax cuts legislation though. Sen. Susan Collins' (R-Maine) is reportedly open to voting to proceed on repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell, even if the other issues aren't yet resolved.
 Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) recently introduced a compromise bill on extending unemployment benefits. There's no indication yet that it will make it to the floor anytime soon, but if it did come up before a vote on the Bush tax cuts, it would put Brown in the tough spot of voting against his legislation or breaking with his party. Brown's office did not respond to The Huffington Post's request for comment.

TITLE: Perry Ad Focuses on Gays and Christianity

PUBLISHED: 2011/12/07

In an appeal to hard-right conservatives, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is broadcasting a new campaign ad that seems to contrast Christianity with homosexuality, vows to end what he calls â€œObamaâ€™s war on religion,â€\\x9d and highlights Mr. Perryâ€™s criticism of overturning the â€œdonâ€™t ask, donâ€™t tellâ€\\x9d policy for gays serving in the military.
 â€œIâ€™m not ashamed to admit that Iâ€™m a Christian,â€\\x9d Mr. Perry says in the ad, â€œbut you donâ€™t need to be in the pew every Sunday to know thereâ€™s something wrong in this country when gays can serve openly in the military but our kids canâ€™t openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school.â€\\x9d
 The Perry campaign did not say where the ad would run, but the focus of Mr. Perryâ€™s multimillion-dollar television budget has been in Iowa, where large numbers of Republican caucusgoers describe themselves as Christian evangelicals.
 The new ad follows Mr. Perryâ€™s statement on Tuesday criticizing the Obama administrationâ€™s announcement that the United States would use all the elements of diplomacy, including the possible granting of foreign aid, to promote gay rights around the world and beat back efforts in other nations to criminalize homosexual conduct.
 â€œAs president, Iâ€™ll end Obamaâ€™s war on religion,â€\\x9d Mr. Perry also says in the ad. â€œAnd Iâ€™ll fight against liberal attacks on our religious heritage. Faith made America strong. It can make her strong again.â€\\x9d
 The Perry ad was denounced by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay men and lesbian group, which said it was â€œwrong for Governor Perry to assume being a person of faith does not afford one to support equality.â€\\x9d
 R. Clarke Cooper, the groupâ€™s executive director, said, â€œGovernor Perry is running to be commander-in-chief, not theocrat-in-chief.â€\\x9d
 He added, â€œOur nation was built upon individual liberty and individual responsibility, and open service by gay and lesbian servicemembers is directly in line with the vision of our founding fathers.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Trump Won't Go Forward With Debate

PUBLISHED: 2011/12/13

Donald J. Trump has dropped plans to moderate a presidential debate, but donâ€™t expect him to fade quietly from the political scene.
 In fact, Republicans may have gotten more than they bargained for by shunning him. Mr. Trumpâ€™s statement on Tuesday that he was bowing out of the Newsmax debate seemed certain to open the door to another round of â€œI just might â€¦â€\\x9d threats from the real estate mogul.
 â€œIt is very important to me that the right Republican candidate be chosen to defeat the failed and very destructive Obama administration,â€\\x9d Mr. Trump said in his statement. â€œBut if that Republican, in my opinion, is not the right candidate, I am not willing to give up my right to run as an independent candidate.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Trump drew considerable criticism from the Republican establishment for moderating a presidential debate while openly saying that he might still run if he was displeased with the candidates. Rather than go ahead with the debate and declare that he will not run â€” Mr. Trump has flirted with running for president several times since the 1980s but has always decided not to follow through â€” he chose to drop the debate.
 â€œI must leave all of my options open because, above all else, we must make America great again!â€\\x9d he said.
 Mr. Trump was facing a potentially awkward task: moderating a debate that only two candidates said they would attend. Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum were the only two Republicans who agreed to participate. Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann, Jon M. Huntsman Jr. and Ron Paul all declined, putting a big dent in Mr. Trumpâ€™s self-proclaimed status as Republican kingmaker.
 Mr. Trump issued the following exclamation-point laden statement through his lawyer, Michael Cohen.

TITLE: Perry Goes After Obama Over Don't Ask Don't Tell

PUBLISHED: 2011/12/07

Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry pledges to end "[President Barack] Obama's war on religion" in a new television ad airing in Iowa, railing against open service of gays and lesbians in the military and the prohibition against prayer in public schools.
 "I'm not ashamed to admit I'm a Christian," says Perry. "But you don't need to be in the pews every Sunday to know that there's something wrong in this country when gays can serve openly in the military but our kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school."
 "As president, I'll end Obama's war on religion and I'll fight against liberal attacks on our religious heritage," the Texas governor continues. "Faith made America strong. It can make her strong again."
 Perry has recently stepped up his attacks on Obama for cultural issues. In a statement released Tuesday, he decried the Obama administrationâ€™s decision to use foreign aid to promote rights for gays and lesbians abroad.
 "This is just the most recent example of an administration at war with people of faith in this country," he said. "Investing tax dollars promoting a lifestyle many Americas of faith find so deeply objectionable is wrong. President Obama has again mistaken America's tolerance for different lifestyles with an endorsement of those lifestyles."
 Politico reported Tuesday that Perry bought $1 million in broadcast television time ahead of the Jan. 3 caucuses. The Dallas Morning Newsrecently reported that his presidential campaign plans to bring "more than 600 influential Texans" to Iowa in December. However, Perry netted just six percent support among likely Republican caucus-goers, according to a Des Moines Register poll released Saturday.

TITLE: Bachmann Newsweek Cover Goes for Insult But Gets Criticism in Return

PUBLISHED: 2011/08/09

Rep. Michele Bachmann has declined to get into the scrum with Newsweek over its cover story of the presidential candidate called "The Queen of Rage," accompanied by an unflattering photo of the Minnesota Republican, but others are calling the magazine out of bounds in its depiction.
 The National Organization for Women President Terry O'Neill said that the cover of the magazine's latest edition is "sexist" and referred to a simple test by the group's founder Gloria Steinem to explain how they determined that conclusion -- would the magazine do the same to a man.
 "Who has ever called a man 'The King of Rage?' Basically what Newsweek magazine -- and this is important, what Newsweek magazine, not a blog, Newsweek magazine -- what they are saying of a woman who is a serious contender for president of the United States of Americaâ€¦ They are basically casting her as a nut job," O'Neill said to The Daily Caller and NOW confirmed to FoxNews.com on Tuesday.
 "The 'Queen of Rage' is something you apply to wrestlers or somebody who is crazy. They didnâ€™t even do this to Howard Dean when he had his famous scream," she said.
 Newsweek has defended the photo -- an extreme close-up of the crystal blue-eyed Bachmann looking over the camera with a dark blue background -- saying that several of the images taken of her appeared the same way. The magazine posted other photos of her on its website, and many of them are flattering.
 Bachmann was asked about the cover during an appearance in Iowa on Monday, where she is campaigning ahead of Thursday's Fox News/Washington Examiner debate and Saturday's Ames Straw Poll. She told voters she had not seen the cover.
 "Ah-hah," she said when told the story headline. "Well, we'll have to take a look at that, won't we?"
 O'Neill said that the main reason her group, which disagrees with Bachmann on almost every issue, would stand up for and defend Bachmann against "these kind of misogynistic attacks is we want women to run for office."
 "Of course my job is to defeat Michele Bachmann and I intend to do so. But good women will not run for office if Newsweek magazine can do this to such a prominent politician and get away with it," O'Neill said.
 Brent Bozell, head of the Media Research Center and ForAmerica, said he's not surprised by the magazine cover.
 "Both Time and Newsweek have been doing this to conservatives for years. It is sheer journalistic dishonesty," Bozell told FoxNews.com. "But it is precisely because of this journalistic dishonesty that conservatives should steer away from these venues -- or at least demand some form of editorial oversight given that these magazines simply cannot be trusted."

TITLE: Obama Taunts G.O.P.  for Ignoring Jobs Bill

PUBLISHED: 2011/11/02

President Obama on Wednesday visited another bridge in need of repair â€“ this one somewhat closer to home, between Washington and Virginia â€” to promote his job-creation proposals as the Senate began the latest partisan debate over his plans.
 But in pressing for approval of $60 billion in infrastructure spending, Mr. Obama took his biggest shot not at the measureâ€™s Republican opponents in the Senate, but at those in the House. He tweaked House Republicans for passing a resolution on Tuesday reaffirming the national motto, â€œIn God We Trust,â€\\x9d when they should be creating jobs.
 â€œI trust in God,â€\\x9d Mr. Obama said, â€œbut God wants to see us help ourselves by putting people back to work!â€\\x9d
 Invoking patriotism as well as divine intervention â€“ Mr. Obama stood against the backdrop of a giant American flag â€“ he spoke before an audience that included unemployed construction workers, whose industry is among the hardest hit by the housing bust.
 â€œIâ€™m joining many of these workers to say that it makes absolutely no sense when thereâ€™s so much work to be done that theyâ€™re not doing the work,â€\\x9d Mr. Obama said to their applause. â€œNot when there are so many roads and bridges and runways waiting to be repaired and waiting to be rebuilt.â€\\x9d
 The presidentâ€™s short trip from the White House to the event stage on the Potomac riverfront came more than a month after he began campaigning throughout the country for his jobs plan, building public pressure on Republicans but winning no votes from them. Mr. Obama singled out the Republican leaders of the House and Senate â€“ Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader â€“ just as he did in September when he visited an aging bridge over the Ohio River that connects their two states.
 Mr. Obama said the two leaders and other Republicans had supported public-works investments in the past. But Republicans oppose Mr. Obamaâ€™s $447 billion job-creation plan, which also includes tax cuts for workers and employers and state aid to avoid layoffs of teachers, police officers and firefighters, because the package would be paid for with higher taxes on those with taxable income of more than $1 million a year.
 For the same reason, some leading business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Associated General Contractors of America, have withdrawn support for the infrastructure spending bill, though Mr. Obama cited the Chamber as a supporter in his remarks.
 The House has declined to take up Mr. Obamaâ€™s jobs package, while Senate Democrats could not muster the 60 votes needed to block a Republican filibuster against either the full $447 billion package or a $35 billion piece providing state aid, mostly for teachersâ€™ pay. With White House support, Senate Democrats have broken the measure into its main parts to force Republicans to take a series of tough votes on proposals, each of which has broad public support, according to polls.
 â€œThe American people are with me with this,â€\\x9d Mr. Obama said. â€œAnd itâ€™s time for folks running around spending all their time talking about whatâ€™s wrong with America to spend some time rolling up their sleeves to help us make it right. Thereâ€™s nothing wrong in this country that we canâ€™t fix.â€\\x9d
 The outcome in the Senate on the infrastructure spending provision, however, is not expected to be any different from the previous two votes.
 Mr. Obamaâ€™s transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, a former Republican congressman from Illinois, appeared with him at the Key Bridge and then went to the Capitol to meet with lawmakers.
 In response to Mr. Obama, House Republicans said the Democratic-controlled Senate should take up some 16 House-passed measures; most would attack federal regulations or spending and would have long-term impact, analysts say, but they would not spur job creation in the coming year or two.
 Mr. Boehner facetiously said that Mr. Obama, as a former Democratic senator, could help: â€œIâ€™m sure he has great influence over there in terms of getting them to take up these bills that really will help put the American people back to work.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Trump Pulling Out Of Debate

PUBLISHED: 2011/12/13

Donald Trump has announced Tuesday that he is pulling out of his own Dec. 27th debate.
 "I have decided not to be the moderator of the Newsmax debate," Trump said in a statement. "I believe this would not only have been the most watched debate, but also the most substantive and interesting debate."
 Trump said that he was ending the debate because he did not want to "give up my right to run as an independent candidate," which he claimed the Republican Party was asking him to do if he wanted to moderate the debate. (Trump made waves by very loudly claiming he was considering running as a Republican earlier in the year.)
 The announcement came just eleven days after Trump initially said he was partnering with the conservative magazine to host a forum with the remaining Republican presidential candidates. Since then, a majority of those candidates made clear that they would not be turning up, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum pledging to appear.
 Trump also attracted the usual share of public ridicule for his decision to moderate, as well as his pledge to endorse whichever candidate he liked best at the debate.
 As the days went on, Trump began making noises about possibly canceling the debate; however, as late as Monday night, he was still saying that the forum was taking place.

TITLE: AARP Open to Social Security Cuts

PUBLISHED: 2011/06/17

WASHINGTON â€” AARP, the powerful lobby for older Americans that has been seen as one of the leading opponents of Social Security benefit cuts, said on Friday that it was open to modest reductions in benefits for future recipients.
 The groupâ€™s stance, which generated quick reaction from all sides because of its powerful voice on the issue, could provide added ammunition to fiscal conservatives who have sought unsuccessfully to restructure Social Security and chip away at the benefits it promises older Americans.
 â€œOur goal is to limit any changes in benefits,â€\\x9d John Rother, AARPâ€™s policy chief, said in a telephone interview, â€œbut we also want to see the system made solvent.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Rother said the groupâ€™s stance on possible cuts, which was first reported in The Wall Street Journal in Fridayâ€™s editions, should be seen less as a major change in position than as a reflection of the political and financial realities facing the Social Security system and the country as a whole.
 â€œYou have to look at all the tradeoffs,â€\\x9d Mr. Rother said, â€œand what weâ€™re trying to do is engage the American public in that debate.â€\\x9d
 He made clear that the groupâ€™s willingness to discuss cuts comes with conditions: Reductions in benefits should be â€œminimal,â€\\x9d they should not affect current recipients and instead should be directed â€œfar off in the future,â€\\x9d and they should be offset by increases in tax-generated revenue.
 Nonetheless, the groupâ€™s openness to the possibility of unspecified cuts was seen as a significant development by people on all sides of the Social Security question because of AARPâ€™s influence on federal policies affecting older Americans, including Medicare, prescription drugs and many more.
 Third Way, a moderate Democratic group in Washington that has favored possible reductions in benefits, called AARPâ€™s position â€œa watershed momentâ€\\x9d in the debate over Social Security.
 â€œNow that they have opened the door to reform, it is time for lawmakers to walk through it,â€\\x9d said Jonathan Cowan, president of Third Way.
 But other advocacy groups that are pushing to preserve Social Security benefits accused AARP of effectively abandoning its core constituency.
 Max Richtman, executive vice president of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group in Washington, said the timing of AARPâ€™s statements was particularly bad because it came in the midst of deliberations between the Obama administration and Congressional Republicans about the debt ceiling and overall deficit reduction.
 AARP insisted that the Social Security trust funds should not be raided to reduce the deficit and that the two issues were separate. But Mr. Richtman said the groupâ€™s openness to considering future cuts would no doubt be used by deficit hawks to push for immediate cuts in Social Security benefits as part of the debate over deficit reduction.
 â€œI think itâ€™s tragic that AARP would, wittingly or unwittingly, play into the hands of people who have never really liked Social Security and want to decimate it,â€\\x9d Mr. Richtman said. â€œAARP is the 800-pound gorilla, but they do not speak for seniors.â€\\x9d
 Republican leaders, who have led calls for revamping Social Security, had no immediate comments on AARPâ€™s willingness to consider benefit reductions.
 An aide to the Republican-led House Ways and Means Committee, who spoke on condition of anonymity under committee protocol, said AARPâ€™s position was a welcome acknowledgment that Social Security would be unable to pay future benefits at the current rate and that it must be restructured.
 â€œThe longer we wait,â€\\x9d the aide said, â€œthe more difficult it will be to protect current beneficiaries and those who rely on Social Security the most.â€\\x9d
 The most recent projections from the Social Security Administration, issued last month, indicate that at the current rate, the programâ€™s trust funds will be exhausted by 2036, and that $6.5 trillion in additional money will be needed over a 75-year period to pay all scheduled benefits.
 Mr. Rother said AARP expected to hear criticism from some of its members over its position on possible cuts.
 â€œWe have such a broad membership, Mr. Rother said. â€œIâ€™m sure there will be some who will not be happy, but others will be eager to see the program put on a stronger financial footing for the long term.â€\\x9d
 While AARP has not issued specific recommendations or figures on how benefit reductions might be carried out, the groupâ€™s recent discussions with its members signal support for using increased revenue to fill two-thirds of the projected gap, and benefits reductions for one-third, Mr. Rother said.
 As word of AARPâ€™s position set off debate in Washington on Friday, the groupâ€™s chief executive, Barry Rand, issued a formal statement saying that the groupâ€™s position had not changed in any substantive way and refuting what he described as â€œmisleadingâ€\\x9d media reports.
 â€œLet me be clear â€” AARP is as committed as weâ€™ve ever been to fighting to protect Social Security for todayâ€™s seniors and strengthening it for future generations,â€\\x9d Mr. Rand said.
 While he did not directly address the question of possible cuts in benefits in his statement, Mr. Rand said his group would be working to evaluate any proposed changes in Social Security â€œto determine how each might â€” individually or in different combinations â€” impact the lives of current and future retirees.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Trump Plans Meeting on Arizona Birth Bill

PUBLISHED: 2011/04/07

Donald Trump is investing more in the conspiracy theories about President Obamaâ€™s birth certificate as he explores his own bid for the presidency.
 In his latest embrace of the birther strategy, Mr. Trump has invited Tea Party leaders and a legislator from Arizona to his office in Manhattan on Friday morning to discuss a bill moving through the Arizona legislature that would require candidates for president to prove that they are natural born citizens.
 The Arizona group said the call from Mr. Trump on Wednesday came unexpectedly, and the group had spent much of the day Thursday scurrying to make travel arrangements to New York.
 â€œOf course I was surprised, who wouldnâ€™t be?â€\\x9d said the legislator, Representative Carl Seel. â€œIâ€™m honored to get the ability to meet with him and discuss it, and I want to thank him for being such a supporter of this issue.â€\\x9d
 In an interview shown Thursday on the â€œTodayâ€\\x9d show, Mr. Trump told Meredith Vieira that he had â€œreal doubtsâ€\\x9d about whether Mr. Obama was born in this country, and that he has sent his own investigators to Hawaii to research the issue. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed Mr. Trump as the most favored candidate among Republicans who consider themselves Tea Party supporters.
 Mr. Obama has shown a certificate of live birth from Hawaii, which is the standard form of birth certificate in the state, and state officials â€“ including the Republican who was governor during the 2008 campaign â€“ have confirmed its authenticity. Several conservatives, including Glenn Beck and Bill Oâ€™Reilly, have criticized Mr. Trump for raising questions about it.
 But polls show that many Republicans continue to believe that Mr. Obama was not born in this country, and therefore is not eligible to be president.
 Kelly Townsend, a founder of the Greater Phoenix Tea Party, said Mr. Trump told them that he was interested in learning more about the legislation in Arizona.
 The bill, which has been approved by committees of the House and Senate, allows great latitude to the secretary of state in denying a presidential candidate a spot on the ballot, saying that the secretary can do so if he or she believes that the documents do not prove citizenship.
 â€œItâ€™s not a birther bill,â€\\x9d Ms. Townsend said. â€œItâ€™s not about Mr. Obama. Itâ€™s about preventing any questions from coming up in the future, putting something in place so no one could question it.â€\\x9d
 But a release from Mr. Seelâ€™s office about the planned meeting noted that Mr. Trump â€œhas brought the issue of President Barack Obama failing to provide a birth certificate front and center recently.â€\\x9d
 Ms. Townsend said she had her own agenda for the meeting at Trump Tower. â€œI want to invite him to Arizona to talk to people and to meet our leaders,â€\\x9d she said. â€œI think heâ€™d have a good audience with Tea Partiers.â€\\x9d

TITLE: AARP Willing To Negotiate On Social Security Retirement Age

PUBLISHED: 2011/06/17

WASHINGTON -- The nation's leading advocate for senior citizens says that it hasn't wavered in its opposition to cutting Social Security benefits, though a top official with the group said it is open to a discussion about raising the retirement age and other changes.
 The Wall Street Journal reported Friday morning that AARP, one of the most influential lobbying groups in Washington, was softening its opposition to cutting retirement benefits.
 AARP initially pushed back against the newspaper's story.
 "Stay tuned -- our position has not changed on Social Security," an AARP spokeswoman said in an email to HuffPost.
 AARP legislative policy director David Certner said on CNN Friday that "there was some miscommunication with the Wall Street Journal story."
 But then Certner acknowledged that AARP believes the program needs to be changed.
 "Everybody knows we need to look at a package of different changes to Social Security to make it strong for the long term," he said. "The reality is, we have more people older and who are living longer, so we need to make changes. Everybody recognizes that. And we're certainly willing to talk about a package of changes that will keep Social Security strong."
 He suggested raising the age at which retirees can receive full benefits -- currently, 66 years old -- would be on the table even though doing so represents "a massive benefit cut for people."
 The 37 million-member lobbying powerhouse launched a national ad campaign Thursday warning members of Congress not to reduce benefits for recipients of Social Security and Medicare.
 Jonathan Cowan, president of centrist think tank Third Way, hailed AARP's apparent reversal, per the Journal story.
 "Today marks a watershed moment in American politics," Cowan said. "For decades, AARP has stood against any substantial changes to Social Security. Now that they have opened the door to reform, it is time for lawmakers to walk through it."
 Yet AARP reassured labor groups that it had not changed its position on Social Security, labor officials told HuffPost.
 "The AARP has a history of division between the top folks and their base on these issues. The top folks like to be in the inside game," one union official said. "But they are walking backwards now."
 The official said that he and other opponents of benefit cuts had been told that AARP's "longstanding position" hadn't changed, but there was some uncertainty about what that position actually is.
 If AARP is open to reducing benefits, it would be a major boost for Social Security reformers who say the program is too generous and therefore unaffordable.
 Social Security will start paying out more in benefits than it absorbs in taxes this year which will lead the retirement program's trust fund to become exhausted in 2036, according to the latest annual trustees report. After 2036, the program will only be able to pay 77 percent of promised benefits. By 2085, it will be able to pay 74 percent of promised benefits.
 As of April, 35 million seniors received Social Security retirement benefits averaging $1,179 a month, according to the program's latest monthly snapshot.
 Economists credit the program for drastically reducing poverty among the elderly since its creation in the 1930s. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive Washington think tank, estimates that Social Security keeps 13 million elderly Americans out of poverty.
 The Journal reported that AARP policy chief John Rother is pushing the organization to accept benefit cuts as part of a deal to make Social Security solvent. Rother's thinking, according to the paper, is that tax increases alone can't keep the program's $2.6 trillion trust fund from running out of money, so benefit cuts must be included as well.
 Social Security's retirement benefits are funded with taxes on incomes up to $106,800, known as the taxable earnings base. The base also effectively serves as a cap on benefits because they are calculated according to a worker's contributions over his or her lifetime.
 A September 2010 Congressional Research Service report found that lifting the cap, without also raising benefits, would make the program solvent for the foreseeable future.
 "If all earnings were subject to the payroll tax, but the base was retained for benefit calculations, the Social Security Trust Funds would remain solvent for the next 75 years," said the report.
 "There are dozens of ways modest tax increases on even just the very wealthiest Americans would restore Social Security to long-run actuarial balance, and there would be enough left over to increase benefits," said Nancy Altman, co-chair of Strengthen Social Security, a 300-member coalition of national and state organizations opposed to benefit cuts.
 The problem with plans to hike taxes is that they're politically unfeasible because of congressional Republicans' adamant opposition to any sort of tax increase, much less a tax increase not accompanied by a spending cut. President Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform drafted a plan that would tweak Social Security by increasing taxes and reducing benefits both. That proposal went nowhere.
 UPDATE: AARP CEO A. Barry Rand said in a statement, "It has long been AARP's policy that Social Security should be strengthened to provide adequate benefits and that it is sufficiently financed to ensure solvency with a stable trust fund for the next 75 years." The statement does not deny that AARP is open to reducing benefits.

TITLE: Donald Trump Signals He Has Investigators Looking Into Obama Citizenship Issue In Hawaii

PUBLISHED: 2011/04/07

WASHINGTON â€” Real estate tycoon Donald Trump said Thursday he hopes questions surrounding Barack Obamaâ€™s U.S. citizenship wonâ€™t be the defining issue if heâ€™s chosen as the Republican candidate to challenge the presidentâ€™s re-election.
 Trump told NBC News in an interview that plans to decide by June whether to run. He said that if heâ€™s nominated, â€œIâ€™d like to beat him straight up,â€\\x9d not on the basis of the birth issue.
 A national NBC/WSJ poll released yesterday shows Trump tied for 2nd with Mike Huckabee in the 2012 GOP primary field at 17 percent (Mitt Romney leads the pack at 21 percent).
 NBC further notes, â€œStrikingly, Trump . . . finishes first among Tea Party supporters (at 20 percent), followed by Romney (17 percent), Huckabee (14 percent), Palin (12 percent) and Gingrich (9 percent).â€\\x9d
 Trump said he didn't introduce the citizenship issue, but was asked about it during an interview a month ago. Since then, he said he's looked into it and believes "there is a big possibility" Obama may have violated the Constitution.
 "I want to see the birth certificate," said Trump in an interview on NBC's "Today" show, according to TIME. "How come his own family doesn't know which hospital he was born in? How come-- forget about birth certificates. Let's say there's no birth certificate. How come in the hospital itself, okay? This is one of the...in the hospital itself, there's no records of his birth. In other words, it doesn't say how much they paid, where is the doctor, here's your room bill."
 Officials in Hawaii have certified that Obama was born in that state. But "birthers" have demanded additional proof, asserting he could have been born in Kenya. "I'm not convinced that he has one," Trump said of the birth certificate issue.
 "Today" show host Meredith Vieira asked Trump, "You've been privy to all of this to know this?" His response: "Well, I have people that actually have been studying it and they cannot believe what they're talking."
 The remarks from the potential presidential candidate prompted Vieira to ask Trump if he had people on the ground in Hawaii searching for proof of the president's citizenship. He signaled he did, saying, "And they cannot believe what they're finding. And I'm serious."
 When asked how genuine his presidential ambition is, Trump said, "I always take things seriously, but I've never taken it seriously like this."
 "I wish I didn't have to do it," he said.
 "I wish this was the greatest place in the world," Trump said, but he also said jobs are disappearing in the United States and that Obama has given the country "a terrible presidency."
 Trump said that if the current fight over budget issues forces a shutdown, "I think the president will be blamed."
 He accused Obama of carrying out a confusing policy on the civil war in Libya, saying "nobody knows what's happening, and now it looks like (Libyan strongman Moammar) Gadhafi is going to beat the United States."
 "I'm only interested in Libya if we get the oil," Trump said. He said Obama "doesn't have a doctrine (on foreign affairs.) Foreign affairs is, we take care of ourselves first"
 Of Obama, he said, "I want him to do well. ... I love this country, but this country is going to hell. ... The world laughs at us. They won't be laughing if I'm elected president."

TITLE: Anthony Weiner Twitter Photo Scandal: Congressman Breaks His Silence

PUBLISHED: 2011/06/01

A day after telling reporters that he's "not going to talk about this anymore," Congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) broke his silence Wednesday about the controversy surrounding a lewd photo sent from his Twitter account.
 "This was a circumstance where someone committed a prank on the internet," he told MSNBC's Luke Russert. "I didn't send [that] picture out" the congressman said, though he does not know who did. Is the photo of him? I can't say with certitude" he told Russert.
 "It was a prank," Weiner reiterated. "This is not a national security matter. We're not making a federal case out of this."
 "I'm not sure it rises -- no pun intended -- to that level," he continued.
 Weiner said he has hired a private security company to investigate how his account has been hacked.
 Last weekend, a lewd photo of a man's bulging underpants was sent to a 21-year-old female college student in Seattle from Weiner's Twitter account. It was quickly deleted, but a frenzy of coverage and comment ensued on blogs, cable news outlets and other media. Weiner's spokesman said that the congressman's Twitter account had been hacked and dismissed the episode as a prank, but this week the congressman hired a lawyer, prompting additional rumors to swirl.
 Earlier this week, the colorful and sometimes combative congressman who represents parts of Brooklyn and Queens was characteristically sharp tongued, refusing to answer reporters' questions about it, and even calling one a "jackass" for interrupting him. He insisted that he wanted to move on from the incident, which was distracting from his work on Capitol Hill. But there was no sign the story, or the speculation about who may have been responsible for tweeting the photo, was fading.
 Weiner failed in a 2005 bid for the Democratic nomination for mayor of New York City, but he is still is widely considered a future contender for the office.
 "I'm not going to talk about this anymore," Weiner told reporters on Capitol Hill. "I think that if I was giving a speech to 45,000 people and someone stood up and heckled in the back, I wouldn't spend three days talking to him. I'm going to get back to the conversation I care about."
 Weiner declined to answer reporters' questions about the photo or why he was hiring a lawyer for the case instead of having law enforcement officials pursue the matter. Weiner was a Twitter follower of the female college student who received the photo.
 The tweet of the lewd photo first was reported Saturday by BigGovernment.com, a website run by conservative commentator Andrew Breitbart.
 The site said the photo was tweeted to a female college student in Seattle. The woman told the New York Daily News that she had never met Weiner, and that there had "never been any inappropriate exchanges" between her and the congressman.
 Weiner, 46, is married to Huma Abedin, an aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
 The congressman over the weekend joked about the incident on Twitter, asking whether his kitchen blender would be next to "attack" him.
 On Tuesday as the House was preparing to vote on the nation's debt limit, Weiner was back tweeting about the vote with his usual partisan edge.

TITLE: Weiner Denies Sending Photo but Is Less Sure About Its Origin

PUBLISHED: 2011/06/01

WASHINGTON â€” Representative Anthony D. Weiner, trying to put to rest a bizarre episode that is overshadowing his role as liberal pugilist and threatening his dream of becoming New Yorkâ€™s mayor, emphatically denied on Wednesday that he had sent a suggestive photograph to a woman in Washington State but said he could not be sure that he is not the person in the image.
 â€œThis was essentially a hacked account that had a gag photo sent out on it,â€\\x9d Mr. Weiner, a Democrat, said during an interview in his office here. â€œI canâ€™t say with certainty very much about where the photograph came from.â€\\x9d
 On Tuesday, Mr. Weiner presided over two testy news briefings at which he had dodged a variety of questions. On Wednesday, he adopted a strikingly different approach, sitting patiently for a series of interviews at which he insisted he had done nothing wrong and marveled at what he said on MSNBC was the â€œAlice in Wonderland worldâ€\\x9d in which a wayward Twitter message had become the talk of the town.
 Mr. Weiner, one of Congressâ€™s most enthusiastic users of social media to engage with constituents and supporters, said he believed his Twitter account, or a related photo-sharing site, had been infiltrated by a hacker or a prankster, who had then sent the offending photo out late Friday.
 He said that he had hired an Internet security company and a lawyer to look into the matter, but that he did not believe the episode merited investigation by federal law enforcement. He did not rule out the possibility that the photo was of him, but said he did not know who could have sent it.
 He said he did not know the woman who received the photo, Gennette Cordova, a student at Whatcom Community College in Bellingham, Wash.; she followed him on Twitter. He said he regretted that Ms. Cordova was caught in the middle of the controversy. She issued a statement over the weekend saying she had never met him, and she has not spoken out since.
 â€œI just feel terrible for her,â€\\x9d Mr. Weiner said, adding that he had never corresponded with her. â€œShe has committed no crime except to follow me on Twitter.â€\\x9d
 The congressman also expressed concern about the toll the episode was taking on his wife, Huma Abedin, a longtime aide to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. â€œIâ€™m protecting my wife, who every day is waking up to these insane stories that are getting so far from reality,â€\\x9d he told CNN. â€œYou know, weâ€™ve been married less than a year.â€\\x9d
 Asked on CNN whether he still wished to be mayor, he said, â€œPut it this way: Itâ€™s the only better job than the one I have.â€\\x9d
 Jack Levin, the chief executive of yFrog, the Twitter-affiliated image and video service that was used to upload the photo, said in an interview on Wednesday that his company did not have reason to believe that its user passwords were exposed or stolen. He said it was possible that the photo could have been sent from Mr. Weinerâ€™s yFrog account through his Twitter password or through a yFrog password.
 Mr. Levin said neither Mr. Weinerâ€™s office nor any law enforcement authorities had contacted him or his company to inquire about the photo.
 Twitter, which does not comment on individual user accounts for privacy reasons, has declined to say whether Mr. Weinerâ€™s account was hacked.
 Despite the swirl of events that has buffeted him for several days, Mr. Weiner has not abandoned his sharp humor. Suggesting that the photo might have been altered, he alluded to a â€œDaily Showâ€\\x9d sketch on Tuesday in which the comedian Jon Stewart, a longtime friend, had joked that the photo could not have been of the congressman.
 â€œI donâ€™t have memory of this photograph,â€\\x9d Mr. Weiner said in the interview in his office. â€œBut I also ... you know, Jon Stewart might have had it right last night: that there were elements of this photograph that might have been doctored.â€\\x9d
 He paused, then added: â€œBut I donâ€™t know that. And I donâ€™t want that to be the headline.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Perry Wins Endorsement of Sheriff Joe

PUBLISHED: 2011/11/29

AMHERST, N.H. â€” Gov. Rick Perry of Texas on Tuesday said he would back a federal policy â€œto detain and to deport every illegal alien that we apprehend.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Perry, in his most expansive comments about illegal immigration since last weekâ€™s Republican presidential debate, was not suggesting any rounding up of illegal immigrants, an aide later made clear, but calling for all people arrested or detained â€” and later found to be undocumented â€” to be expelled from the country after an expedited hearing.
 The candidate sought to draw a contrast with the Obama administration, which he criticized as having a â€œcatch-and-releaseâ€\\x9d policy that allows some nonviolent illegal immigrants to be released back into the general public.
 Itâ€™s a â€œhorrific policy,â€\\x9d Mr. Perry said.
 Backers of the policy say it allows officials to focus resources on deporting illegal immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes or who are a threat to the public safety or the national interest.
 With a little more than a month to go before the New Hampshire primary, the Texas governor is trying to shore up his credentials on immigration: On Tuesday he won an endorsement from one of the nationâ€™s most outspoken and controversial public officials on that issue: Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Ariz., who unabashedly calls himself the â€œtoughest sheriffâ€\\x9d in the country.
 Appearing at Joeyâ€™s Diner here, in the southern end of the state, Mr. Arpaio, who had also been courted by Representative Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain, praised what he called Mr. Perryâ€™s efforts to interdict illegal crossings by sending Texas Rangers and other state law enforcement to the Texas border with Mexico.
 â€œHe doesnâ€™t just talk about it; he does something about it,â€\\x9d Mr. Arpaio said.
 Mr. Perry was widely criticized within his own party for backing a state plan that gives some children of illegal immigrants the same lower-cost in-state college tuition that is enjoyed by American citizens who attend the stateâ€™s public universities and who have been Texas residents at least three years.
 At one point he suggested that those who opposed his position were heartless. On Tuesday he repeated his apology for that comment, calling it â€œvery inappropriate,â€\\x9d his latest effort to try to win back some Republican primary voters who abandoned him as rivals sought to paint him as too soft on illegal immigration.
 But it remains to be seen how much an endorsement from Sheriff Arpaio will help him in this state, where Mr. Perry is polling far behind the leader, Mitt Romney. According to one recent poll, immigration was cited by only 4 percent of likely Republican voters as the most important issue.
 Mr. Arpaio is also a polarizing figure. Last year, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against the sheriff for not cooperating with an investigation into whether the Maricopa County Sheriffâ€™s Department is systematically violating the rights of Hispanics. It was the first time in a generation, according to officials, that the federal government has filed suit to force a law enforcement agency to cooperate with such an investigation.
 The sheriff has called the Justice Departmentâ€™s action an attempt to intimidate him and he has said he does not engage in racial profiling. Mr. Arpaio, who gained wide notice for forcing inmates to wear pink underwear and housing them in tents, is popular in his state, where he has repeatedly won re-election by a sizable margin.
 Even so, there are signs that the stateâ€™s aggressive immigration policies have begun to turn off some: Earlier this month a longtime Arpaio ally, Arizona State Sen. Russell Pearce, was defeated in a recall election by a more moderate Republican. Mr. Pearce had pushed through a controversial law last year that would have turned police officers throughout the state into de facto immigration agents.
 The Justice Department is fighting the law, which has not taken effect yet. On Tuesday, Mr. Perry signaled that he would not support the continuation of that lawsuit if he were elected president, saying that the federal government should not â€œbe suing states for making decisions that they thinkâ€\\x9d are in the best interests of their citizens.

TITLE: Newsweek's Michele Bachmann Cover Raises Eyebrows

PUBLISHED: 2011/08/08

Newsweek's latest issue features a Michele Bachmann cover that's sure to stir up controversy.
 The cover shows Bachmann standing against a stark blue background, looking directly into the camera with a wide-eyed expression. The headline advertising the magazine's story reads, "THE QUEEN OF RAGE."
 "Rage" is a word that doesn't appear in Newsweek's actual profile of Bachmann, though author Lois Romano does criticize what she calls the "radical" nature of the Tea Party that Bachmann champions.
 Conservative websites are already crying foul over the cover, with some saying it makes Bachmann look "crazy" and one blogger asking, "Can anyone really say with a straight face that the mainstream media is not totally biased against conservatives?"
 It's not the first time Newsweek has faced conservative backlash for a cover. In June, the magazine portrayed Mitt Romney as one of the stars of the Broadway show "The Book of Mormon." And, of course, it drew widespread criticism for its infamous Sarah Palin cover in 2009.
 See the Bachmann cover below, and tell us whether you think it crosses a line.

TITLE: Supreme Court Questions Claims in Sex Bias Suit Against Wal-Mart

PUBLISHED: 2011/03/29

A pending class action lawsuit against Wal-Mart that would be the largest of its kind in U.S. history may soon be dismissed, considering the tenor of oral arguments before the Supreme Court Tuesday.
 Although she may ultimately side with the plaintiffs, even Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an ardent defender of women's rights, expressed some concerns about the particulars of the sex discrimination lawsuit that covers 1.5 million women and could cost the world's largest retailer billions of dollars.
 The key vote for a Wal-Mart victory could belong to Justice Anthony Kennedy, who said he was troubled by what he called an inconsistency in the women's lawsuit.
 "Number one, you said this is a culture where Arkansas knows, the headquarters knows, everything that's going on," Kennedy told lawyer Joseph Sellers who represents the women. "Then in the next breath, you say, well, now these (local) supervisors have too much discretion."
 The lawsuit alleges that the company's corporate culture, described in court Tuesday as the "Wal-Mart Way," fosters the advancement of male workers over their female counterparts. It also claims that despite a company policy expressly prohibiting discrimination, local store managers are given too much flexibility in determining salary hikes and job promotions that invariably favor men over women.
 This dual argument that confounded Justice Kennedy also drew the ire of Justice Antonin Scalia who said he was whipsawed by the claims. "If somebody tells you how to exercise discretion, you don't have discretion," he said.
 Chief Justice John Roberts also offered his doubts about the merits of lawsuit, suggesting that any discriminatory acts at Wal-Mart are no worse than anywhere else.
 "Is it true that Wal-Mart's pay disparity across the company was less than the national average?" he asked.
 Sellers said that wasn't a fair comparison because Wal-Mart has an obligation under federal law to make sure its managers do not discriminate.
 The case started a decade ago when Wal-Mart worker Betty Dukes said the management at her Pittsburg, Calif., store was bypassing her for promotions. "I could see the men going forth and the women in the store stayed in the basic positions they were always in," Dukes once told an interviewer.
 Her discrimination claims were folded into a class action lawsuit covering all current female Wal-Mart employees and any who worked for the company going back to late 1998. Two lower courts said the case could move toward trial. Wal-Mart's appeal is asking the Supreme Court to stop the case from ever getting to a trial judge.
 On Tuesday, Dukes walked out of the courthouse full of confidence and poise saying she feels no anger toward her bosses or anyone else. "Wal-Mart may be a big company and that is no doubt.
 But they are not big enough where they can't be challenged in a court of law. If you do wrong, then you should be held accountable. From the least of us to the greatest of us."
 Dukes's case has drawn the attention of the larger business community who fear that if the justices allow the case to proceed, it will open the doors to more class action lawsuits. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and major corporations including Bank of America, General Electric and Microsoft submitted briefs in the case supporting Wal-Mart.
 Much of the hour-long argument delved into the tedious details of class action law and if the Wal-Mart women could properly certify their claims into a single case. Wal-Mart lawyer Theodore Boutrous argued that every member of the class couldn't possibly meet a standard of commonality to justify the lawsuit.
 "Our expert's report and testimony showed that at 90 percent of the stores, there was no pay disparity," Boutrous told the court. "And that's the kind of -- and even putting that aside, the plaintiffs needed to come forward with something that showed that there was this miraculous recurrence at every decision across every store of stereotyping, and the evidence simply doesn't show that."
 Another technical concern that appears to work against the women covers the different types of remedies they are seeking. In addition to the punitive damages they want an injunction that would force Wal-Mart to adopt more stringent anti-discrimination policies. But those two remedies require different standards for class certification and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said it was "a very serious problem" in the case to try and sue for punitive damages after only obtaining certification under the lower threshold required for the injunction.
 It's possible that instead of an outright victory for Wal-Mart, the justices could issue a split decision of sorts and allow only the injunction part of the lawsuit to move forward. That potential ruling would get Wal-Mart off the hook for any financial damages.

TITLE: AARP Pushes Back on Claim About Social Security Concessions as Lawmakers Push Reform

PUBLISHED: 2011/06/17

The AARP pushed back Friday on a report claiming the nation's most powerful seniors lobby was dropping its opposition to benefits cuts -- but at the same time acknowledged "benefit adjustments" would be necessary to make the system solvent.
 The flurry of reports and statements left unclear whether AARP was opening up to new concessions in the debate over Social Security, as several lawmakers place reform proposals on the table.
 The Wall Street Journal first reported Friday that the AARP, which opposed President George W. Bush's push to partially privatize Social Security, has decided to accept cuts -- though it would reportedly push for tax hikes to close most of the long-term Social Security shortfall.
 AARP CEO Barry Rand later issued a statement calling the article "misleading" and claiming "AARP has not changed its position on Social Security."
 He said AARP remains opposed to cutting Social Security for the sake of deficit reduction and to any privatization plan. "We are currently fighting proposals to cut Social Security to pay the nation's bills," he said.
 However, AARP legislative policy director David Certner told Fox News that Social Security needs a "package of revenue and benefit adjustments ... to make it solvent."
 While the AARP claims its position on strengthening Social Security remains unchanged, others outside the organization detected a shift.
 Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who on Thursday unveiled her own Social Security reform package, said Friday that the AARP has marked "a huge shift in the debate on the solvency of Social Security."
 "AARP's new and welcome position is a positive step towards the type of reforms I've championed, and I look forward to working with the organization to shape the changes in a way that makes the least detrimental impact to present and future retirees," she said in a statement.
 There is still plenty of space between the kind of plan Hutchison is calling for and what groups like the AARP would accept.
 Hutchison's plan does not include tax hikes. Her office claims the bill would cut deficits by $416 billion over the next decade and keep Social Security solvent by instead raising the retirement age to 69 over 16 years and cutting yearly cost-of-living adjustments by 1 percent. Workers who are 58 and older would not be affected.
 "Those two things would keep our Social Security system solvent for 75 years with really, I think, minor pain and a big gain," she told Fox News on Thursday.
 But the AARP has told Fox News that Hutchison's proposal is not acceptable.
 Asked about the possibility of Social Security entering budget talks at some point, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney reiterated past statements in saying President Obama does not see Social Security as a "driver" of the country's near-term deficits.
 "The president supports measures to strengthen Social Security, but he does not support anything that would slash benefits for future generations," Carney said Friday.
 The back-and-forth comes amid new warnings about the future of Social Security. Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Fund last week warned the Social Security Trust Fund will be exhausted in 2036 and under current law, seniors would then face a 23 percent across-the-board cut in benefits.
 But the president's budget director told Fox News that even when the trust funds run out, both Social Security and Medicare would still have some income.
 "We have a little bit of time," said Jack Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget. "We do have a challenge, but it's not that we fall off of a cliff."
 With AARP potentially backing off its opposition, other groups are poised to take up the fight. A coalition of groups called Strengthen Social Security has railed against cuts to cost-of-living adjustments, recently releasing a report claiming "even the modest COLA on which Social Security benefits are adjusted isn't safe."

TITLE: Rep. Weiner Denies Sending Lewd Photo, Can't Say Whether Image Is Him

PUBLISHED: 2011/06/01

Rep. Anthony Weiner, in an interview with Fox News, said Wednesday he's certain he did not send a lewd photo of somebody's bulging underwear to a college student via Twitter. But the congressman repeatedly declined to say whether the picture was an image of him.
 The congressman, who described the incident as "mischief," continued to allege that he was the victim of a computer hacker. He said he's asked an Internet security firm and a law firm to take a "hard look" at the incident and find out what happened, though he suggested he doesn't want to make a federal case out of it. He said somebody is just trying to distract him.
 "I know for a fact that my account was hacked," Weiner told Fox News. "I can definitively say that I did not send this."
 He also said he "certainly" does not know the college student the image was sent to -- though, when asked repeatedly, Weiner declined to say whether he was shown in the image.
 The New York Democrat, who is known for his combative style in interviews and on the House floor, granted a series of TV interviews after getting testy with reporters late Tuesday.
 At the time, he repeatedly said he would not allow the incident to distract him from his job, as he likened what he described as a "prank" to somebody shouting out an insult or throwing a pie during a speech.
 Asked point-blank, "Is that picture you?" Weiner replied, "You know I'm not going to talk about this anymore."
 "This is the tactic. The guy in the back of the room who's throwing the pie or yelling out the insult wants that to be the conversation," Weiner told reporters. "But I am not going to allow this thing to dominate what I talk about."
 As reporters continued to ask him for several minutes whether he sent the image, the exchange became heated. At one point, Weiner referred to a reporter in the scrum as a "jackass."
 Weiner referred to prior statements his office had put out, indicating he was through talking about the matter.
 Though Weiner's office had earlier responded to media inquiries, a few details appear to be keeping the story alive.
 Weiner's office initially said the congressman's account was "obviously hacked," but the representative has since taken to calling the incident a "prank" -- he used both terms Wednesday.
 The U.S. Capitol Police so far have not opened an investigation into the matter.
 A former Justice Department computer crimes prosecutor said it would not cost much to request an investigation from the FBI. The former official said if Weiner had called the FBI when the story broke, the public would already know where the Tweet originated. Though Weiner said the incident did not constitute a federal crime, the former official said multiple federal crimes would have been committed if somebody did hack into his account -- and it could lead to years behind bars.
 Amid the controversy, a Twitter official emailed security tips to members of Congress regarding their accounts.
 "While we won't comment on individual accounts, news reports of the past few days are a good reminder of the importance of actively protecting your account credentials," Twitter's Adam Sharp wrote.
 He urged offices to use a "strong password" of at least 10 characters including numbers and symbols, be on the lookout for "suspicious links," and refrain from giving out passwords to "untrusted third-parties."
 The photo in question showed a close-up shot of a man's bulging underwear. It was deleted within minutes of being sent. Breitbart's BigGovernment.com first reported that it was tweeted to a Seattle woman, later identified as Gennette Cordova.
 Cordova is just one of 198 people that Weiner follows on Twitter, though he has nearly 50,000 followers. Porn star Ginger Lee tweeted last month that she received a direct message from Weiner, and several other attractive women say they've been surprised to get a "follow" or a message from the prominent Democrat. Those claims are all circumstantial, but it doesn't help his case should there ever actually be one.
 Weiner, 46, is married to Huma Abedin, an aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

TITLE: Purpose Behind Congressional Reading of Constitution Questioned After Amendments Are Omitted

PUBLISHED: 2011/01/06

Even for a Congress known to battle over every little detail, reading the U.S. Constitution aloud sounded like a simple exercise.
 Turned out it wasn't.
 Newly sworn members of the House reading aloud the country's founding document on Thursday didn't recite every verse and article of the document because Republicans decided that the obsolete parts can be skipped since they've been superseded by amendment.
 For instance, lawmakers did not read the 18th Amendment, which imposed prohibition on liquor in 1919. However, they did read the 21st Amendment, which repealed prohibition in 1933 and is still in force.
 Republicans also left out the part about counting slaves and Native Americans as three-fifths of a person.
 Portions of the U.S. Constitution are never deleted, just amended, as has been done 27 times in history. But all the original decisions remain in the Constitution, including in the copies authorized by Congress' Joint Committee on Printing and used in Thursday's reading.
 And that was the point of contention for Democratic lawmakers who complained that exempting parts of the document from the reading undermines the objective of the exercise.
 "This is very emotional for me," Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., said on the floor before the reading began.
 "Given the struggle of African Americans, given the struggle of women, given the struggle of others to create a more perfect document, to hear that those elements of the Constitution that have been dedacted (sic) by amendment are no less serious, no less part of our ongoing struggle to improve the country and our desire to continue to improve the Constitution, many of us don't want that to be lost upon the reading of our sacred document," he said.
 Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., commented that the original document has been changed through amendment, leaving the the reader to interpret the operative language.
 "I think it would be helpful to the members if you would explain to us how the determinations of what to read has been made or not made so that we all be on the same page as to congressional intent," he said to Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., who presided over the reading.
 Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., questioned the reading of the "amended" Constitution.
 "To not read the full document, including all the text that was later amended, is to fail to acknowledge the struggle our nation has constantly fought, within and without, to 'keep' our Republic," he said in a written statement.
 "It is a failure to show Americans that while we seek a more perfect union, we do so from imperfect beginnings, through an imperfect history, with an imperfect government created by an imperfect document," he added. "We fail to show the American people that imperfection is not to be feared and that our ability to constantly improve on what the Founders gave us is a blessing, not a reason for divisiveness."
 Other lawmakers decried the exercise altogether, saying the Constitution is a living document that shouldn't be followed to the letter.
 "They are reading it like a sacred text," Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the former chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, told The Washington Post.
 Nadler derided what he called the "ritualistic reading" as "total nonsense" and "propaganda" intended to give Republicans claim to the document. He argued that the Founders were not "demigods" and that the document's needs for amendments to abolish slavery and other injustices showed it was "highly imperfect."
 "You are not supposed to worship your Constitution," he told the newspaper. "You are supposed to govern your government by it."
 But for all those who described the exercise as political waste -- including Vanity Fair magazine, which estimated it as costing more than $1 million -- supporters noted that it was an historic moment -- the first time the U.S. Constitution had been read on the U.S. House floor.
 "I think that this is a very symbolic showing to the American people and reminder to the members of congress that we are a government of laws not of men and that this Constitution is the foundation for all of our laws," Goodlatte said.
 And backers said that it wouldn't hurt to try to live by the aspirations of the Founding Fathers.
 "I don't think the Constitution is propaganda. I think it's a valuable exercise and an important moment in this Congress for us to read the Constitution," said Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y. "But I do think that you can't just read it like a speech and then leave skid marks on it in your legislative record."
 Historian Alan Brinkley of Columbia University told Fox News the reading may be "a bit of theater," but it is "not insignificant given that many Republicans have decided -- implausibly, in my opinion -- that the Constitution is the vehicle that can reduce the size of government."
 But Roger Pilon of the Cato Institute said Congress needs to re-read the Constitution to be reminded how out of control government has become.
 "Today the Congress regulates our lives and redistributes our wealth in ways that would shock the Founders," he said. "The Constitution, they wrote that to ensure limited government and they meant for most of us to live our lives free from government, in the private sector, planning and living our own lives, not as dependents on government goods and services."
 Pilon added that the Founders never intended for the Constitution to be viewed as fluid advice.
 "When liberals tell today that the Constitution is essentially a blank slate to be filled by transient majorities, nothing could be further from the truth. If that were so, it would never have been ratified in the first place," he said.
 As the Constitution was being read inside the lower chamber, Nadler and others gathered outside the Capitol to push for passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, a perennial effort to update the document with a statement on women.
 "John Boehner and his cronies are holding up the U.S. Constitution as a sacred, perfect document. But we know the Constitution is far from perfect because it does not guarantee women's equality," NOW President Terry O'Neill said in a statement.

TITLE: Trump Sends Investigators to Hawaii, Gains in GOP Presidential Primary Poll

PUBLISHED: 2011/04/07

WASHINGTON -- Real estate tycoon Donald Trump said Thursday he has doubts about whether President Obama was born in the United States and has sent investigators to Hawaii looking for answers.
 The "Celebrity Apprentice" star has shot up in the polls as a potential GOP nominee, in part because of his questions about whether Obama is constitutionally allowed to be president if he doesn't prove he is a natural-born citizen of the United States.
 "I have people that actually have been studying it and they cannot believe what they're finding," Trump told NBC's "Today" show on Thursday.
 Officials in Hawaii have certified Obama's citizenship, but a segment of society -- labeled "birthers" in the vernacular -- have demanded additional proof. Trump said when he started seriously considering a presidential bid a few weeks back, he thought the president was native-born, but now he's not so sure.
 "His grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya, and she was there and witnessed the birth. He doesn't have a birth certificate or he hasn't shown it. He has what's called a certificate of live birth. That is something that's easy to get," Trump said, arguing that Obama has spent $2 million in legal fees "to get away from this issue."
 Calling it potentially one of the biggest scams in the history of politics, Trump said he'd like Obama to show his birth certificate.
 "And to be honest with you, I hope he can," he told "Today."
 Trump, who placed second in an NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll of potential 2012 Republican candidates, said he will decide by June whether to run, and if he is the GOP nominee, "I'd like to beat him straight up," not on the basis of the question of where Obama was born.
 In the poll, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney leads the would-be group of contenders with 21 percent of Republican primary voters surveyed followed by Trump and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee at 17 percent each. The Republican primary poll was taken as part of a March 31-April 4 survey of 1,000 adults, but the sample survey of Republican primary voters polled was only 238.
 In the poll, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich garnered 11 percent, while former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin earned 10 percent support. Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty earned 6 percent, Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann got 5 percent, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum won 3 percent and Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour received 1 percent support.
 Asked in the interview how genuine his presidential ambition is, Trump, who would have to hand over the reins of his international empire in order to run the country, said, "I always take things seriously, but I've never taken it seriously like this. I wish I didn't have to do it."
 But speaking on ABC News, New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie, who is insistent he personally is not a candidate for president in 2012, said he wasn't sure his friend Trump would be either.
 "Donald's a really good friend of mine, I don't know that Donald really wants to be president," Christie said in an interview that aired Wednesday night. Christie: I don't know that he wants that in particular. ... We've spoken about it and all I could say to you is, Iâ€™ll believe it when I see it."
 Back on NBC, Trump said he wants Obama to do well, but the presidency is not going that direction.
 "I love this country, but this country is going to hell. ... The world laughs at us. They won't be laughing if I'm elected president," he said.
 Trump accused Obama of conducting a confusing policy on the civil war in Libya, saying "nobody knows what's happening, and now it looks like (Libyan strongman Muammar) al-Qaddafi is going to beat the United States."
 "I'm only interested in Libya if we get the oil," Trump said. He said Obama "doesn't have a doctrine (on foreign affairs.) Foreign affairs is, we take care of ourselves first."

TITLE: Supreme Court Hears Argument In Wal-Mart Sex Bias Lawsuit

PUBLISHED: 2011/03/29

WASHINGTON â€” The Supreme Court appears ready to block a massive sex discrimination lawsuit against Wal-Mart on behalf of up to 1.6 million women, and that could make it harder for other workers nationwide to bring class-action claims against large employers.
 The 10-year-old lawsuit, argued in lively exchanges at the court Tuesday, claims that Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest employer, favors men over women in pay and promotions. Billions of dollars are at stake if it is allowed to go forward.
 The case also could affect the future of other class-action lawsuits that pool modest individual claims into a single action that creates the potential for a large judgment and increases the pressure on businesses to settle.
 In Tuesday's arguments, several justices suggested they were troubled by the case and lower court decisions against Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart. Estimates of how many women could be included in the lawsuit run from 500,000 to 1.6 million.
 Justice Anthony Kennedy, often a key vote on the high court, said the women's argument points in apparently conflicting directions.
 "You said this is a culture where Arkansas knows, the headquarters knows, everything that's going on," Kennedy said to Joseph Sellers, the women's lawyer. "Then in the next breath, you say, well, now these supervisors have too much discretion. It seems to me there's an inconsistency there, and I'm just not sure what the unlawful policy is."
 Sellers said that lower courts had been persuaded by statistical and other evidence put forth so far in the lawsuit. He said Wal-Mart's strong corporate culture stereotypes women as less aggressive than men and that translates into individual pay and promotion decisions at the more than 4,300 Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores across the country.
 "The decisions are informed by the values the company provides," Sellers said.
 Justice Antonin Scalia said he felt "whipsawed" by Sellers' description. "Well, which is it?" Scalia asked. Either individual managers are on their own, "or else a strong corporate culture tells them what to do."
 Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that at this stage of the lawsuit, the issue is not proving discrimination but showing enough evidence to go forward. "We're talking about getting a foot in the door," Ginsburg said, a standard she called not hard to meet.
 Ginsburg, who made her name as a lawyer by bringing discrimination claims, said it was possible that Wal-Mart could refute the claims at a trial.
 The court's other two female justices, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, and Justice Stephen Breyer also appeared inclined to allow the lawsuit to proceed.
 But several of their more conservative colleagues appeared to agree with Theodore Boutrous Jr., representing Wal-Mart, that even subjecting the company to a trial would be unfair.
 That split among the justices raised the prospect of an ideologically divided ruling by the court this summer.
 Boutrous said the class-action nature of the case deprives the company of its legal rights because it is being forced to defend the treatment of female employees regardless of the jobs they hold or where they work.
 "There is absolutely no way there can be a fair process here," Boutrous said.
 He pointed to a group of at least 544 women who serve as store managers who "are alleged to be both discriminators and victims."
 Two of the named plaintiffs, Christine Kwapnoski and Betty Dukes, attended the argument. Kwapnoski is an assistant manager at a Sam's Club in Concord, Calif. Dukes is a greeter at the Wal-Mart in Pittsburg, Calif.
 Their situations were discussed only briefly, with Boutrous noting how different they were as a way to argue they should not be dealt with in the same lawsuit.
 Business interests have lined up with Wal-Mart while civil rights, women's and consumer groups have sided with the women plaintiffs.
 Both sides have painted the case as extremely consequential. The business community has said that a ruling for the women would lead to a flood of class-action lawsuits based on vague evidence. Supporters of the women say that if the court sides with Wal-Mart, it could remove a valuable weapon for fighting all sorts of discrimination.
 David Sanford, who represents plaintiffs in other class-action cases, said after the arguments that the court seemed inclined to rule against the Wal-Mart women. Sanford said such a decision could "have implications for class actions more generally, making it more difficult for women and minority groups to enjoy equality and fair treatment in the workplace."
 The Obama administration is not taking part in the case, although it was lobbied by both sides.

TITLE: Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio Endorses Rick Perry

PUBLISHED: 2011/11/29

Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his tough and controversial stances on illegal immigration, endorsed three term Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday morning during a campaign swing with Mr. Perry through New Hampshire.
 The self-titled America's Toughest Sheriff, who famously re-instituted chain gangs in 1995 and has also been a major supporter of his state's controversial SB1070 immigration law, said that Perry has done more to combat illegal immigration along the U.S. border then any of the other candidates.
 "I'm endorsing Rick Perry because we need a tough-on-crime president who will champion and fund full-time border security operations from Brownsville to San Diego," Arpaio said. "Governor Perry has a superior border security record and plan to make our border and our nation safer."
 "Sheriff Arpaio knows the struggle border states face as Washington politicians and bureaucrats fail time and again to properly secure our nation's southern boundary with Mexico," said Gov. Perry. "I am honored to have Sheriff Arpaio's support for my presidential campaign and our shared goals of fighting border crime with more personnel, border fencing and surveillance. A secure border is vital to protecting America's national security, public safety and jobs."
 The endorsement from Arpaio could prove helpful to Perry who has faced criticism about his stance on immigration from the Right for his support of DREAM children.
 The illegal immigration issue has also been a hotbed for clashes between Perry and GOP presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney.
 Romney has said that Perry provided a magnet for undocumented immigrants to settle in Texas by supporting a law that allows people who are in the country unlawfully to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates.
 "You said I don't want to build a fence," Romney said. "You talk about magnets -- you put in place a magnet."
 Perry has also said the federal government should extend work visas permitting undocumented immigrants to move freely between the U.S. and their home countries, but stressed that he still opposes amnesty or a path to citizenship.
 "As president, I will secure the border within a year putting thousands more federal boots on the ground, strategic fencing and aerial resources to fight border crime and make our states and nation safer," Perry said.

TITLE: Perry TV Ad: I Can Defend Faith from Obamaâ€™s â€œWar on Religion

PUBLISHED: 2011/12/07

Down in the polls, Texas Gov. Rick Perry is on the attack, claiming in a new TV ad that President Obama is waging a "War on Religion," and he's the GOP candidate that can defend faith in America.
 "I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm a Christian, but you don't need to be in the pew every Sunday to know there's something wrong in this country when gays can serve openly in the military but our kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. As President, I'll end Obama's war on religion. And I'll fight against liberal attacks on our religious heritage," says Perry in the new ad titled "Strong."
 The ad is a state-wide buy in Iowa that starts Wednesday.
 Perry ties his faith to his conservative stands on social issues, and the campaign has zeroed in on gay marriage and social issues recently, releasing several statements laying out its argument that Obama is attacking the fundamentals social conservative believe in. The arguments range from President Obama directing the Justice Department to stop arguing for the Defense of Marriage Act, to less substantive examples like Obama leaving God out of his Thanksgiving speech this year.
 In one emailed statement, Perry stated, "just when you thought Barack Obama couldn't get any more out of touch with America's values, AP reports his administration wants to make foreign aid decisions based on gay rights. This administration's war on traditional American values must stop. This is just the most recent example of an administration at war with people of faith in this country. Investing tax dollars promoting a lifestyle many Americas of faith find so deeply objectionable is wrong. "Perry is referring to a presidential memorandum released by the White House, in which Obama has directed all agencies working abroad ensure U.S. diplomacy and aid programs "promote and protect" the rights of gays and lesbians.
 Perry is a Methodist. He has never shied away from his faith during this campaign, and in earlier appeal to key evangelical voters, he released another ad in Iowa describing himself as a "man of faith."
 This latest ad "Strong" ends with Perry claiming, "faith made America strong. It can make her strong again."

TITLE: Trump Bows Out as Moderator of GOP Debate, Reserves Right to Run for President

PUBLISHED: 2011/12/13

Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he is bowing out as the moderator for a Republican presidential debate later this month, after most candidates in the field opted not to attend.
 Trump said he wanted to make sure there's no "conflict of interest" in case he decides to run as a third-party candidate next year. He cast his decision as a way to keep his options open.
 He said later on Fox News that he's still considering an independent bid. "I am looking at it, if the Republicans choose the wrong candidate, which is a possibility, and if the economy continues to be bad, which I think it will be," Trump said.
 The real estate mogul and reality TV star said he wants to make sure Republicans pick the "right" candidate -- he said he still plans to make an endorsement despite his threatened third-party run.
 Though the Dec. 27 debate technically is sponsored by Newsmax, Trump quickly became the face of it after he was named as moderator.
 While former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum agreed to attend early on, other Republican candidates subsequently bowed out.
 Some expressed concern that Trump, who previously flirted with a possible Republican presidential bid before shelving the idea, would not definitively rule out running as a third-party candidate.
 Trump on Tuesday specifically cited Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus' concerns about his involvement. He said he does not expect Newsmax to follow through with the debate now that he's out.
 "We would have done very well. We would have gotten great ratings," Trump said, voicing his trademark confidence.
 Trump first announced his debate decision in a written statement Tuesday afternoon.
 "It is very important to me that the right Republican candidate be chosen to defeat the failed and very destructive Obama administration, but if that Republican, in my opinion, is not the right candidate, I am not willing to give up my right to run as an independent candidate," he said. "Therefore, so that there is no conflict of interest within the Republican Party, I have decided not to be the moderator of the Newsmax debate. ... I must leave all of my options open because, above all else, we must make America great again!"
 Trump went on to praise Gingrich and Santorum for "having the courage, conviction, and confidence" to agree to the debate.

TITLE: Bachmann Cover Controversy Prompts Response From Newsweek

PUBLISHED: 2011/08/09

Splashed across the cover of this weekâ€™s Newsweek magazine is a picture of the Republican presidential candidate and Tea Party favorite Representative Michele Bachmann. Her eyes are open wide â€” very, very wide â€” focused intensely somewhere off in the distance, just a smidge too high above the camera. At the bottom of the page, floating across her torso in bold white letters, are the words â€œThe Queen of Rage.â€\\x9d
 Many in the conservative blogosphere are not pleased.
 â€œExactly what were the editors thinking putting this kind of a picture of a sitting congresswoman and presidential candidate on their cover?â€\\x9d wrote Noel Sheppard on the conservative Web site News Busters, under the headline â€œNewsweek Puts Picture of Michele Bachmann on Cover That Makes Her Look Crazy.â€\\x9d
 A blogger on the Web site Freedomâ€™s Lighthouse said, â€œCan anyone really say with a straight face that the Mainstream Media is not totally biased against conservatives?â€\\x9d
 But even some unlikely allies have emerged to decry the cover as disrespectful.
 â€œItâ€™s sexist,â€\\x9d said Terry Oâ€™Neill, the president of the National Organization for Women, to the news Web site the Daily Caller, which is run by the conservative commentator Tucker Carlson.
 â€œGloria Steinem has a very simple test,â€\\x9d Ms. Oâ€™Neill continued. â€œIf this were done to a man or would it ever be done to a man â€“ has it ever been done to a man? Surely this has never been done to a man.â€\\x9d
 Monday night, Newsweek responded to the controversy by posting an â€œouttakesâ€\\x9d gallery on its Daily Beast Web site, showcasing other photos taken for the article. The pictures show Ms. Bachmann shaking hands with voters, standing by herself in the corner of a room and signing autographs, all with the same wide-eyed intensity as in the cover shot.
 The cover goes with an article by Lois Romano about Ms. Bachmannâ€™s place in the Tea Party movement and on the national stage. The article itself seems to have spawned little outrage.
 This is not the first time Newsweek has caused a stir with its cover choices. In 2009, the editors selected a photo of Sarah Palin in running shorts, which the former governor â€” and many others â€” called â€œsexist.â€\\x9d
 Just this past June, the news magazine ran a computer generated image of Catherine, the new Duchess of Cambridge, walking alongside Princess Diana, who has been dead for nearly 14 years.
 The Atlantic Wire ran a story about that cover called, simply, â€œHow Creepy Is Princess Dianaâ€™s Ghost on the Cover of Newsweek?â€\\x9d

TITLE: Obama Mocks Congress For Vote

PUBLISHED: 2011/11/02

President Barack Obama urged lawmakers to move on the transportation funding portion of his jobs bill Wednesday, while simultaneously mocking them for spending time on supposedly less-important undertakings, such as a recent measure to reaffirm "In God We Trust" as the national motto.
 In a speech from beneath the D.C. area's Key Bridge, Obama told spectators that Congress had time to bring up votes on aspects of the American Jobs Act, but were instead dealing with more frivolous legislation.
 "And if Congress tells you they don't have time, they've got time to do it," Obama said.
 "In the House of Representatives, what have you guys been doing, John?" Obama continued, calling out Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-Ohio). "You've been debating a commemorative coin for baseball. You've had legislation reaffirming that 'In God We Trust' is our motto. That's not putting people back to work. I trust in God, but God wants to see us help ourselves by putting people back to work."
 On Wednesday, the House voted 396-9 on a bill that reaffirmed the motto and encouraged its display in all public schools and government buildings.
 The bill's sponsor, Rep. Randy Forbes (R-Va.) had argued that some people, including Obama, needed to be reminded of the motto.
 "Almost a year ago, the president in making a speech across the world said that our national motto was 'E pluribus unum,'" Forbes said. "When the [U.S. Capitol] Visitor Center was opened ... they did not have the national motto in there. In fact, they inscribed in the stones that our national motto was 'E pluribus unum.'"
 In a speech in Jakarta last year, Obama remarked that the American "motto is E pluribus unum -- out of many, one." Officially, this wasn't correct. Minnesota congresswoman and now-GOP presidential candidate Michele Bachmann and other members of the Congressional Prayer Caucus piled on weeks later, penning a letter to Obama chastising him for his alleged failure to the use the word "God" and "Creator" more in his public speeches, especially abroad.

TITLE: Justices Take Up Crucial Issue in Wal-Mart Suit

PUBLISHED: 2011/03/29

WASHINGTON â€” The Supreme Court appeared closely divided on Tuesday during arguments over the theory put forth by the plaintiffs in an enormous sex discrimination class-action case against Wal-Mart.
 Even some justices who seemed sympathetic to the plaintiffs expressed qualms about how to administer a lawsuit involving as many as 1.5 million women seeking back pay that could amount to billions of dollars. Others appeared worried about the consequences for other businesses of a ruling that would allow the case against Wal-Mart to go forward.
 The mere certification of a class-action suit can prompt defendants to settle in light of the sums at stake, and the justices struggled to find a way to distinguish between gaps in pay that might have benign explanations and those caused by unlawful discrimination.
 The court of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has recently issued a series of rulings in favor of plaintiffs suing for employment discrimination that cut against the courtâ€™s pro-business reputation. The Wal-Mart case dwarfs those rulings in importance. It is the largest employment discrimination class action in history, and the courtâ€™s decision, expected by June, will probably be its most important business ruling this term.
 The issue before the justices at Tuesdayâ€™s arguments was not whether Wal-Mart, the countryâ€™s largest retailer and biggest private employer, discriminated against women who worked there. For now, the question in the case, Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes, No. 10-277, is whether hundreds of thousands of female workers have enough in common to join together in a single lawsuit.
 The plaintiffsâ€™ theory is that a centralized companywide policy gave local managers too much discretion in pay and promotion decisions, leaving Wal-Mart vulnerable to gender stereotypes. The plaintiffs have presented sworn statements and statistics to support their claim.
 Wal-Mart calls that evidence unrepresentative and unreliable. The company says its policies expressly bar discrimination and promote diversity. In any event, the company says, the plaintiffs â€” who worked in 3,400 stores in 170 job classifications â€” do not have enough in common to warrant class-action treatment.
 Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said the theory about how the company discriminated â€” through a central policy conferring local discretion â€” was internally inconsistent. â€œYour complaint faces in two directions,â€\\x9d he told a lawyer for the plaintiffs.
 But Justice Stephen G. Breyer said Wal-Mart could be held accountable if it failed to take action in the face of reports of discrimination from its stores. â€œShould central management under the law have withdrawn some of the subjective discretion in order to stop these results?â€\\x9d Justice Breyer asked.
 Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed, saying that companies had a responsibility to make sure that women were treated fairly in local workplaces. And Justice Elena Kagan said that â€œexcessive subjectivityâ€\\x9d may be a policy that violates the civil rights laws.
 But Justice Antonin Scalia was unconvinced.
 â€œIâ€™m getting whipsawed here,â€\\x9d he told the plaintiffsâ€™ lawyer, Joseph M. Sellers. â€œOn the one hand, you say the problem is that they were utterly subjective, and on the other hand you say there is strong corporate culture that guides all of this. Well, which is it?â€\\x9d
 Mr. Sellers responded that â€œthere is this broad discretion given the managersâ€\\x9d but that â€œthey do not make their decisions in a vacuum.â€\\x9d Managers, he went on, â€œare informed by the company about how to exercise that discretion.â€\\x9d
 That did not satisfy Justice Scalia. â€œIf somebody tells you how to exercise discretion,â€\\x9d he said, â€œyou donâ€™t have discretion.â€\\x9d
 Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer for Wal-Mart, said the handful of women named as plaintiffs who seek to represent the entire class did not have typical experiences at the company.
 â€œEach of the plaintiffs have very different stories,â€\\x9d he said. â€œOne of them was promoted into a managerial position. One was terminated for disciplinary violations. One was promoted and then had a disciplinary problem and then was demoted.â€\\x9d
 He added that â€œthis class includes at least 544 store managers who are alleged to be discriminators and victims.â€\\x9d
 Several justices had practical concerns.
 â€œWhat seems to me a very serious problem in this case is, how do you work out the back pay?â€\\x9d Justice Ginsburg asked.
 Mr. Sellers said the trial court could rely on statistics culled from company databases, which he said were more reliable than the evidence that might be presented in individualized hearings given the available information about particular pay and promotion decisions. Memories have faded, he said, and Wal-Mart did not keep good records.
 Given that, Mr. Sellers said, Wal-Martâ€™s personnel decisions were â€œstandardlessâ€\\x9d and â€œrecordless.â€\\x9d
 Justice Kennedy responded with a point about the suitability of the case for class-action treatment. â€œIf itâ€™s standardless and recordless,â€\\x9d he said, â€œthen why is there commonality?â€\\x9d
 Mr. Boutrous said Mr. Sellers was trying to have it both ways.
 â€œThe problem here, Mr. Sellers says, is that the records are not available,â€\\x9d Mr. Boutrous said. â€œThen he says weâ€™re going to have a proceeding where the district judge relies only on the records that he says are inadequate, to allow a reconstruction of the decision. That is not a process known to our jurisprudence. It doesnâ€™t comport with due process.
 Several justices voiced concerns about how many companies could be subject to class-action suits if they allowed the case against Wal-Mart to go forward.
 â€œIs it true,â€\\x9d Chief Justice Roberts asked Mr. Sellers, â€œthat Wal-Martâ€™s pay disparity across the company was less than the national average?â€\\x9d
 Mr. Sellers said that was not the appropriate comparison. â€œThe comparison thatâ€™s relevant,â€\\x9d he said, â€œis between men and women and Wal-Mart.â€\\x9d He added later that â€œWal-Mart was behind the other large retailers.â€\\x9d
 The chief justice also asked Mr. Sellers â€œhow many examples of abuse of the subjective discrimination delegation need to be shown before you can say that flows from the policy rather than from bad actors?â€\\x9d After all, he said, â€œyouâ€™re going to have some bad applesâ€\\x9d given Wal-Martâ€™s thousands of stores.
 Mr. Sellers responded that â€œthere is no minimum numberâ€\\x9d in court decisions.
 Justices Kennedy and Samuel A. Alito Jr. said they were concerned about companies whose pay and promotion gaps mirror national numbers where there is no proof of a discriminatory policy.
 â€œSo, you have the company that is absolutely typical of the entire American work force,â€\\x9d Justice Alito said. â€œThen you would say every single company is in violation of Title VIIâ€\\x9d of the Civil Rights Act?
 â€œThat could very well be the case,â€\\x9d Mr. Sellers said.

TITLE: 'America's Toughest Sheriff' Endorses Rick Perry

PUBLISHED: 2011/11/29

Controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio announced on Tuesday he will officially endorse Texas Governor Rick Perry for the Republican presidential nomination, which could give Perry something of a credibility boost on immigration and border issues.
 Arpaio is a hardliner on immigration, leading a push in Maricopa County for more enforcement. He is famous for pushing worksite raids and creating a "Tent City," a military-style holding ground for inmates, now in its eighteenth year.
 His endorsement of Perry comes after the candidate was criticized for his immigration platform, which rests on the idea that deportation of all 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country is impractical and unlikely. Perry also opposes a full border fence, although he calls for more enforcement along the southwest border with Mexico.
 "The federal government has failed on border crime and border enforcement, and no candidate for president has done more to secure the border than Governor Rick Perry," Arpaio said in a statement. "I have been watching Governor Perry and Texas closely and know his border surge operations with state, local and federal law enforcement officials have helped shut down the illegal trafficking of weapons, drugs and people. I'm endorsing Rick Perry because we need a tough-on-crime president who will champion and fund full-time border security operations from Brownsville to San Diego. Governor Perry has a superior border security record and plan to make our border and our nation safer."
 Perry said in a statement that if elected president, he would "secure the border within a year." As Texas governor, he directed funds to enforcement along the border and requested more National Guard troops from President Barack Obama.
 "Sheriff Arpaio knows the struggle border states face as Washington politicians and bureaucrats fail time and again to properly secure our nation's southern boundary with Mexico," Perry said in a statement. "I am honored to have Sheriff Arpaio's support for my presidential campaign and our shared goals of fighting border crime with more personnel, border fencing and surveillance. A secure border is vital to protecting America's national security, public safety and jobs. As president, I will secure the border within a year putting thousands more federal boots on the ground, strategic fencing and aerial resources to fight border crime and make our states and nation safer."
 Arpaio endorsed Mitt Romney in 2008, choosing him over eventual nominee and fellow Arizonan John McCain. He held a joint press conference with Herman Cain in October after the two met to discuss immigration enforcement.

TITLE: House Reading of Constitution Is Not Without Issues

PUBLISHED: 2011/01/06

Setting the tone for the 112th Congress â€” in which every House bill must cite the constitutional source of its authority â€” members of the House of Representatives began to read the United States Constitution aloud from the chamberâ€™s floor on Thursday morning.
 Like the Constitutional Convention itself, things did not begin auspiciously.
 Before the reading began, Jay Inslee, Democrat of Washington, asked Republicans to illuminate exactly what part of the Constitution would be read, what parts would be deleted and who would decide how things would unfold.
 It was decided in advance that any portion of the Constitution that was superseded by amendments â€” including the amendments themselves â€” would not be read, preventing lawmakers from having to make references to slaves, referred to in Article 1, Section 2 as â€œthree fifths of all other persons,â€\\x9d or to things like prohibition.
 These inquiries about parliamentary procedure were not well received, and for several minutes, before a word of the preamble could be uttered, Democrats and Republicans battled back and forth over the issue of language, perhaps presaging future partisan battles over the meaning, purpose and application of the document.
 Once that was settled, just after 11 a.m., Representative John A. Boehner, the newly installed speaker of the House, read the preamble (that magical â€œWe the peopleâ€\\x9d), before yielding to the woman who handed him the gavel on Wednesday, Representative Nancy Pelosi, who picked up with Article 1, Section 1 (â€œAll legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representativesâ€\\x9d), followed by Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, and other House leaders.
 From there, members who wished to read were recognized from their seats, beginning with Representative Steve Rothman, Democrat of New Jersey. And so, sentence by sentence, in accents that reflect the myriad districts that did not even exist when the document came into being, by women and African Americans whose full rights were not recognized at that time, the constitutional language fluttered through the chamber.
 At one point, there was yelling in the chamber, and the sergeant-at-arms was called to remove a protester.
 The reading of the document on the floor of the House, an act that is part of the new rules package, serves several purposes, said Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, who came up with the idea for the live reading. Largely, it was meant to instruct members, who now must use it to underlie their bills, and to inform voters.
 â€œThroughout the last year there has been a great debate about the expansion of the federal government, and lots of my constituents have said that Congress has gone beyond its powers granted in the Constitution,â€\\x9d said Mr. Goodlatte, a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over constitutional amendments. He added: â€œI think it is important that we send a message to people at home that the constitution is an important document.â€\\x9d
 But it was also clearly meant as a nod to the Tea Party, a loosely organized political movement whose members cite the Constitution as the basis for much of their political theory concerning federal powers and the rights and responsibilities of Congress. To wit, the document reading happened on the same day that House Republicans began the contentious process of repealing the health care law, which they have long said lacks constitutional basis.
 The order of reading was ironed out at the last minute, with the goal of letting all who wished to read do so, but making sure there was party parity, Mr. Goodlatte said. â€œWe have spread the word to everyone, and there was a lot of interest,â€\\x9d he said.
 According to the Office of the Historian of the House of Representatives, the only two prior instances in which a full or partial text of the Constitution was inserted into the Congressional Record was in 1882, when Roswell Flower of New York â€œappendedâ€\\x9d a text of the Constitution â€” minus the amendments â€” into the record, and in 1915, when Thomas Reilly of Connecticut inserted the full text of the Constitution into the Congressional Record as an extension of his remarks. But the office could not find any examples of the full text of the Constitution actually being read out loud on the House Floor.

TITLE: Obama: â€˜In God We Trust' Vote Not Creating Jobs

PUBLISHED: 2011/11/02

The House vote to reaffirm that "In God We Trust" is the U.S. motto is "not putting people back to work," President Obama said Wednesday in a speech pushing his jobs bill.
 "I trust in God, but God wants to see us help ourselves by putting people back to work," the president said during a speech at Key Bridge in Washington, D.C., where he was highlighting the need for federal funding of infrastructure repairs nationwide.
 Asked later in the day whether it was fair to invoke God in the debate over the Congressional schedule, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said, "Yeah, I think it's a fair jab if I do say so myself."
 "I believe that phrase from the Bible is 'the Lord helps those who help themselves.' And I think the point the president is making is that, you know, we should -- we have it within our capacity to do the things to help the American people. And that's why he's working so hard to get Congress to take action on the American Jobs Act and the provisions therein," Carney told reporters at his daily briefing. The phrase quoted by Carney is not in the Bible, though it is often mistaken as a verse.
 Later when the official White House briefing transcript was released, there was an asterik, to Carney's statement, "* This common phrase does not appear in the Bible," it read.
 Carney said the particular reference by the president to God was made in the context of "inaction by the House of Representatives, which has spent time on issues like commemorative Hall-of-Fame baseball coins and reaffirming a motto that I don't think anyone doubted, is that â€˜In God We Trust' is our motto. So his point was simply that the House should get busy with matters of great importance to the United States and to the American people."
 During his remarks, the president also called out House Speaker John Boehner for what the administration has made a drumbeat over the last week -- a do-nothing Congress.
 "What have you guys been debating, John? You've been debating a commemorative coin for baseball?" Obama said. The House resolution on the national motto passed Tuesday was introduced by Rep. Randy Forbes, R-Va., and considered under an expedited floor procedure. It passed in a 396-9 vote.
 After the vote, Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., one of the nine lawmakers to vote against the resolution, said the nation faces bigger problems, such as the economy, failing public schools and poverty.
 "Instead of facing these challenges and creating jobs to help American people make sure they have a roof over their head and food on their table, we are debating whether or not to affirm and proliferate a motto that was adopted in 1956 and is under no threat of attack," he said.
 House Republicans have argued that the procedural votes don't take up very much time. They add that they have brought up 15 bills that they contend will help create jobs but have been ignored in the Democratic-led Senate. The Senate is preparing to take up a portion of the president's jobs bill - on infrastructure -- after the $447 billion jobs package failed when offered as a whole.
 Carney contended that Congress wouldn't be focused at all on jobs if not for the president's power of persuasion.
 "If not for the president's insistence on pushing the American Jobs Act, would we be having a debate about jobs and the economy right now in Washington or would Congress be -- or the Republicans in Congress be so divorced from the reality that Americans are encountering every day that they would be debating matters wholly unrelated to the primary concerns of the American people? I think that's possible. I mean, I know that Democrats would be out there pushing this, and certainly the president is," he said.

TITLE: House Republicans Read Constitution On Second Day In Power

PUBLISHED: 2011/01/06

WASHINGTON - And on the second day of Republican rule, the House read the Constitution.
 Those wondering whether the reading would be dramatic found out on Thursday as volunteers gave voice to the seven articles and 27 amendments that make up the nationâ€™s governing document.
 Republicans have made strict adherence to the Constitution a key tenet of their effort to reduce the size of the federal government. The House GOP will reportedly make it a requirement that all new bills put forth in the legislative body include â€œa statement by the lawmaker who wrote it citing the constitutional authority to enact the proposed legislation.â€\\x9d
 The Washington Post reported last week that reading the founding document in full appears to be a first in the chamberâ€™s 221-year history:
 â€œCall it the tea party-ization of Congress. ... These are two standout changes on a long list of new rules Republicans will institute in the House when they assume the majority on Jan. 5. After handing out pocket-size Constitutions at rallies, after studying the document article by article and after demanding that Washington return to its founding principles, tea party activists have something new to applaud. A pillar of their grass-roots movement will become a staple in the bureaucracy that governs Congress.â€\\x9d
 Politics Daily recently reported:
 â€œBeyond its symbolic power, however, it is unclear what impact the new rule will have upon the nation. Under axiomatic legal precedent, virtually all congressional action is presumed valid anyway, at least initially. Moreover, by taking their oaths of office, lawmakers swear to abide by the Constitution, and virtually all legislation is vetted for constitutional support on some level by government lawyers before it makes it to committee or to the floor of the House. It is also quite obvious, from 223 years of legal and political debate on the topic, that the text of the Constitution itself, including those portions that deal with legislative power, is susceptible to many different (and often evolving) views and interpretations, a practical reality that would likely render most â€œConstitutional Authority Statementsâ€\\x9d controversial and contentious.â€\\x9d
 According to Peter Keating at Vanity Fair, $1.1 million is the estimated cost of GOP plans to read the document on the House floor.
 â€œThe amount I get is nearly $1.1 million. $1,071,872.87, to be exact, though of course this is more back-of-the-envelope than exact. When one chamber of Congress is in session but not working, we the people still have to pay for membersâ€™ salaries and expenses, and for their police protection, and for keeping their lights and phones and coffee machines on.â€\\x9d
 â€œWe always hear members of Congress talking about swearing an oath to represent their constituents, when in reality the only oath we take is to the Constitution,â€\\x9d explained newly-minted Speaker John Boehner to the Post.
 â€œOn November 2nd, voters called for an end to reckless spending and a renewed commitment to the Constitution,â€\\x9d said Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), who has emerged a prominent voice of the Tea Party movement, to the Post. â€œThese new rules show that Republicans are serious about respecting the Constitution.â€\\x9d
 Also on Thursday, the House is to take up its first spending cut measure, a proposed 5 percent trim in the budgets of leadership, rank-and-file member and committee offices. Republicans have estimated that this will save $35 million over the next nine months.

TITLE: Boehner Sees One-in-Three Chance G.O.P. Will Lose House

PUBLISHED: 2012/04/23

Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio said on Monday that Republicans had a one-in-three chance of losing control of the House in November, a surprisingly downbeat assessment from a Republican leader who until now has expressed no fears of losing the gavel.
 In an interview with Fox News, to be shown on Tuesday, Mr. Boehner delivered what aides called a wake-up call to his troops.
 â€œI would say that there is a two-in-three chance that we win control of the House again, but thereâ€™s a one-in-three chance that we could lose, and Iâ€™m being myself, frank,â€\\x9d he said in an interview first posted online by the newspaper The Hill. â€œWeâ€™ve got a big challenge, and weâ€™ve got work to do.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Boehner pointed to what aides called â€œorphan districtsâ€\\x9d in Democratic-leaning states that would not be a factor in the presidential campaign. Local Republican Party affiliates are less organized in such states and turnout may be depressed.
 â€œWe have 50 of our members in tough races, 89 freshmen running for their first re-elections, and we have 32 districts that are in states where there is no presidential campaign going to be run, no big Senate race,â€\\x9d he said. â€œYou take 18 of them, California, Illinois and New York, where you know weâ€™re not likely to do well at the top of the ticket, and those districts are frankly pretty vulnerable.â€\\x9d
 House political analysts also have looked at such states, but redistricting in California â€“ run by an independent commission â€“ has been as tough on Democrats as it has been on Republicans. Illinois and New York could be a problem for Mr. Boehnerâ€™s party, but Republican-run redistricting in North Carolina and Indiana would appear to counter those Democratic gains.
 But Democrats have become bolder on their predictions. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll last week found that voters favored a Democratic-controlled Congress over a Republican one 46 percent to 41 percent, a spread that has not changed much all year.

TITLE: Mitt To Akin: Drop Out

PUBLISHED: 2012/08/21

Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney on Tuesday joined a chorus of Republicans calling for Rep. Todd Akin (R-Mo.) to drop out of the U.S. Senate race in Missouri.
 "As I said yesterday, Todd Akin's comments were offensive and wrong and he should very seriously consider what course would be in the best interest of our country," said Romney in a statement. "Today, his fellow Missourians urged him to step aside, and I think he should accept their counsel and exit the Senate race."
 Akin, however, continued his refusal to step down Tuesday in a subsequent interview on Sean Hannity's radio show.
 "It still seems to me that there has to be room â€¦ to broaden the scope of what a campaign needs to be about," he said, going on to suggest Romney had made a bigger deal of the remark than he needed to.
 "Why can't Mitt Romney run his race and I'll run mine?" Akin continued.
 He later confirmed that vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan called him and told him to "give some thought to stepping down," but didn't tell him to get out.
 Akin also claimed he would help Romney and the Republican party in November by soldiering on, but admitted that no senator had called him to ask him to stay in the race.
 On Sunday, Akin prompted outrage with his response to a question about supporting abortion in the case of rape.
 "From what I understand from doctors, that's really rare," said Akin said of pregnancies caused by rape. "If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. But let's assume maybe that didn't work or something. I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist."
 Romney had stopped short of calling on Akin to resign in an interview with WMUR Monday.
 Other officials in the GOP, including five senior Missouri Republicans, were less forgiving, however, suggesting that Akin had created an irreversible distraction and could no longer run as a viable candidate.
 Akin had also vowed to remain in the race earlier Tuesday on the radio show of former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee. During the interview, Akin said he would continue campaigning because he still believed he could win.

TITLE: Boehner: '1-in-3 chance' Republicans could lose House in November

PUBLISHED: 2012/04/23

John Boehner is setting expectations high -- but apparently not too high -- for this year's congressional elections, telling Fox News that the Democrats have a chance of retaking the House.
 The House speaker, in an interview with Fox News to air Tuesday morning, gave his Republican Party a "two-in-three chance" of holding on to control of the House after taking power in the 2010 elections.
 "But there's a one-in-three chance we could lose," Boehner said. "I'm being myself -- frank. We've got a big challenge, and we've got work to do."
 Democrats face an uphill battle in their efforts to take back the House, where Republicans hold a 242-190 seat advantage.
 And control of the Senate could be up for grabs this year, too, with Democrats clinging to a fragile six-vote majority. The oddsmakers who track congressional races with obsessive dedication project a handful of pickups for Republicans in the Senate -- but not necessarily enough to get to 51.
 In the House, a flurry of redistricting decisions appears to be working as of late in the Democrats' favor, though the chaotic process has stung both parties repeatedly.
 The Democrats would need 25 seats in the House to regain the majority -- a very steep climb in a year when neither party is particularly popular. However, Democrats are thought to have far more safe seats than Republicans going into November. Earlier this year, the Rothenberg Political Report projected a Democratic pick-up of between five and 12 seats.
 In total, 33 Senate seats are in play this year, with 23 currently held by Democrats and 10 held by Republicans. Ten of those 33 seats are open -- again, the state of play is in the Republicans' favor, with seven held by Democrats and three held by Republicans.
 But while Republicans have several opportunities to pick off those Democrat-held seats, three races in particular could undermine those potential gains for the GOP. Republican Sens. Scott Brown in Massachusetts and Dean Heller in Nevada, who was appointed to fill the vacancy left by John Ensign, are both considered vulnerable. And Sen. Olympia Snowe, a Republican from Maine, said she wouldn't seek re-election this year.

TITLE: Georgetown Faculty Latest to Chide Ryan

PUBLISHED: 2012/04/24

Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, has been excoriated by some Roman Catholic leaders ever since he claimed this month that his budget plan, which slashes antipoverty programs, was inspired by the moral teachings of his Catholic faith.
 The latest criticism comes in a letter released Tuesday and signed by nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown, the Jesuit university in Washington, in advance of Mr. Ryanâ€™s visit there on Thursday. Mr. Ryan is to deliver the prestigious Whittington Lecture, named for an associate dean who was killed on the airplane that crashed into the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001.
 The letter says, â€œWe would be remiss in our duty to you and our students if we did not challenge your continuing misuse of Catholic teaching to defend a budget plan that decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few.â€\\x9d
 â€œYour budget appears to reflect the values of your favorite philosopher, Ayn Rand, rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ,â€\\x9d says the letter, which the faculty members sent to Mr. Ryan along with a copy of the Vaticanâ€™s Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church â€” â€œto help deepen your understanding of Catholic social teaching.â€\\x9d
 The pressure on Mr. Ryan is part of an effort by some Catholic leaders who are political independents, liberals and Democrats to make it clear that the Catholic church is not an arm of the Republican Party. In the last year, Catholic bishops have emerged as vocal critics of the Obama administration over what they regard as violations of religious freedom, in particular the mandate that even religious employers must provide health insurance that covers birth control.
 Their condemnation has grown so heated that this month, Bishop Daniel Jenky, of Peoria, Ill., said in a homily that President Obama was so intolerant of religion that he was â€œfollowing a similar pathâ€\\x9d as Hitler and Stalin. Dozens of faculty members at Notre Dame, also a Catholic university, sent a letter to the president and chairman of the board of trustees last Friday asking them to rebuke Bishop Jenkyâ€™s comments and seek his resignation from the board. Bishop Jenky has stood by his comments.
 The budget authored by Mr. Ryan, a rising star among conservatives, has given Catholic leaders an opportunity to distance the church from the Republican Party. In an interview this month on the Christian Broadcasting Network, Mr. Ryan claimed that his budget was consistent with Catholic moral teaching because it pushes the poor to become independent of government assistance.
 â€œThe preferential option for the poor, which is one of the primary tenants of Catholic social teaching, means donâ€™t keep people poor, donâ€™t make people dependent on government so that they stay stuck at their station in life, help people get out of poverty out onto life of independence,â€\\x9d he said.
 The letter released Tuesday by the faculty at Georgetown took Mr. Ryan to task for that argument, saying that Catholic teaching calls for government to step in and help when communities â€œface problems beyond their means to address, such as economic crises, high unemployment, endemic poverty and hunger.â€\\x9d
 The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also issued several letters to members of Congress calling for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor. Mr. Ryan claimed in a recent interview that those letters did not speak for all bishops, but the conference responded that those letters do indeed represent the bishopsâ€™ collective opinion.

TITLE: Chick-fil-A Draws Huge Crowds for Appreciation Day

PUBLISHED: 2012/08/01

Hundreds of thousands of people across the country headed to Chick-fil-A restaurants on Wednesday, answering a call from Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, to show support for the fast-food chain after the companyâ€™s president drew criticism for his opposition to same-sex marriage.
 Long lines were seen outside Chick-fil-A restaurants nationwide, and many customers documented their visits on social media sites and shared their reasons for eating at the chain.
 Many said they showed up because they agreed with the position of Chick-fil-Aâ€™s president on same-sex marriage, while others said they wanted to support freedom of expression for business owners.
 As my colleagues Kim Severson and Robbie Brown report from Atlanta, where Chick-fil-A began in the 1940s, the president, Dan T. Cathy, made comments last month about the biblical arguments against homosexuality. This prompted calls to boycott Chick-fil-A that were supported by the mayors of Boston and Chicago, along with plans for a same-sex kiss-in at the restaurants on Friday.
 Last weekend, Mr. Huckabee used his television and radio programs, as well as Facebook, to help organize an appreciation day for Chick-fil-A on Wednesday.
 More than 650,000 people signed up to participate, and tens of thousands â€œlikedâ€\\x9d photos of packed restaurants that Mr. Huckabee posted on his Facebook page on Wednesday.
 Below are some of the photos shared Wednesday on Twitter from Chick-fil-A restaurants around the country.
 Representative Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota, shared a photo from her visit.
 Last week, Sarah Palin posted a photo of her visit to a Chick-fil-A in California on her Facebook page.
 Mr. Huckabee noted in regular audio updates Wednesday that Chick-fil-A did not participate in organizing the event. And there were no tweets or photos about the appreciation day on the companyâ€™s Facebook or Twitter accounts.
 In response to the outpouring of support for Chick-fil-A, many people used social media to share their disappointment.
 One Facebook user who lives near Austin, Tex., posted this status update:
 â€œIt has been really disconcerting how many of my FB friends have stood up on the side of hate and proudly posted their photos of Chick-fil-a â€” and they all have their little quotes about how they â€˜love their gay friendsâ€™ but they â€˜donâ€™t approveâ€™ of their lifestyles.
 So I am asking you kindly to please un-friend me â€” I have no use for friends like you.â€\\x9d
 The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation has asked supporters to donate the cost of a meal at a Chick-fil-A, about $6.50, to gay and lesbian rights groups.
 Facebook users are also signing up to participate in a â€œNational Same-Sex Kiss Dayâ€\\x9d planned for Friday at Chick-fil-A restaurants. People are being encouraged to post photos of their kisses.
 Others are not waiting until Friday to post their photos.

TITLE: Sparks fly as Biden, Ryan face off in feisty vice presidential debate

PUBLISHED: 2012/10/12

In a head-to-head battle of proxies, Vice President Biden wasted no time Thursday trying to do what many Democrats felt President Obama failed to against Mitt Romney, going on offense with an often disdainful attack on Paul Ryan -- who stood his ground against a barrage of Biden grins, guffaws, snickers and interruptions.
 The dueling running mates turned the lone vice presidential debate into an uncharacteristically feisty affair, scrapping over everything from the economy to Libya to taxes. But it was the vice president who set the aggressive tone, blatantly striving to hit the reset after President Obama was panned for his lackluster performance at last week's opening debate.
 If Obama was too cold, Biden at times bordered on too hot, analysts said afterward.
 He chuckled and smirked through many of Ryan's responses. But unlike Obama a week ago, he let few points go unchallenged.
 Biden went after the Romney/Ryan ticket with a directness that Obama did not. Notably, he hammered Mitt Romney over his secretly videotaped comment in which he said he doesn't have to worry about the "47 percent" of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes.
 "These people are my mom and dad, the people I grew up with, my neighbors," Biden said, adding he's "had it up to here" with those kinds of comments.
 Ryan shot back, in reference to Biden's tendency to make gaffes: "As the vice president very well knows ... sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way."
 "But I always say what I mean," Biden responded.
 Ryan accused Obama of "projecting weakness" with his foreign policy, particularly in his response to the terror attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. At home, he accused the administration of presiding over a shoddy recovery.
 "This is not what a real recovery looks like," Ryan said.
 Whether the debate will alter the course of the race remains to be seen. There are two more presidential debates on the calendar, and the polls have started to swing in Romney's favor. The tightening was reflected in the candidates' attitude onstage Thursday, each loath to give the other too many seconds of speech-time without a challenge.
 The economy, the budget deficit and foreign policy were central. Each candidate made frequent appeals to the middle class, Biden by pledging to protect programs in the federal budget and Ryan by pledging to grow the economy for everybody.
 Ryan opened the debate with tough criticism of the Obama administration over its handling of the Libya terror attack.
 "What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy," Ryan said.
 With the moderator, ABC News' Martha Raddatz, opening the debate with a question about the Libya strike, which happened a month ago Thursday, Ryan criticized the administration for waiting more than a week after the strike to call it a coordinated terror attack.
 "This is becoming more troubling by the day. They first blamed the YouTube video. Now they're trying to blame the Romney/Ryan ticket for making this an issue," he said. Ryan was referring to a claim by an Obama aide earlier Thursday that the only reason the attack had entered the political debate was because of Romney's criticism - a claim Romney rejected.
 Biden was quick to retort: "With all due respect, that's just a bunch of malarkey. ... Not a single thing he said is accurate."
 He added: "This talk about this weakness, I don't understand what my friend's talking about."
 Biden also criticized Romney for making a "political statement"on the night of the attack, a reference to Romney's criticism of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo's early response to protests there. On the question of why the administration initially claimed the attack was the result of a protest, Biden explained "the intelligence community told us that."
 The face-off Thursday night was taking on outsized importance for a vice presidential debate.
 After Obama's debate performance last week, the pressure was on Biden to recapture the momentum -- while equally on Ryan to prevent the Obama ticket from blunting Romney's surge.
 Ryan referred to the weight on Biden's shoulders about mid-way through, as the two talked over each other on Medicare.
 "Mr. vice president, I know you're under a lot of duress to make up for lost ground, but I think people would be better served if we don't keep interrupting each other," Ryan said.
 On Medicare, Biden charged that the Republican ticket's plan would raise costs for future seniors with a de facto "voucher" system. "Their ideas are old and their ideas are bad and they eliminate the guarantee of Medicare," he said.
 Ryan shot back: "They got caught with their hand in the cookie jar turning Medicare into a piggy bank for ObamaCare."
 The debate veered across the spectrum of topics from the campaign trail. On Iran's nuclear program, Biden repeatedly suggested Romney and Ryan would too readily choose the military option to stop it. On abortion, he cautioned that the next president will get to choose one or two justices on the Supreme Court -- "that's how close Roe v. Wade is."
 Ryan, toward the end of the debate, warned that a "debt crisis is coming" and claimed the sitting president offers little more than speeches to address the deficit.
 "That's what we get in this administration -- speeches. But we're not getting leadership," he said.
 In a matter of days, Romney has picked up steam in both battleground and national polls. The latest Fox News national poll of likely voters showed Romney edging Obama, 46 percent to 45 percent.
 Obama has acknowledged he had a "bad night" in his debate last week, but the campaign indicates it will be more aggressive going forward. After Biden's more feisty performance Thursday, Obama campaign manager Jim Messina quipped that he's a "happy warrior" for the middle class.
 The final presidential debates will be held Oct. 16 and Oct. 22. The next one will be a town hall format focusing on a range of issues, and the last one will focus exclusively on foreign policy.

TITLE: Romney Reaffirms Opposition to Marriage, or Unions, for Gay Couples

PUBLISHED: 2012/05/10

Like many conservative Republicans, Mitt Romney is opposed not only to same-sex marriage, but also to the civil unions that many states have adopted as an alternative to full marital rights for gay couples.
 Now that President Obama, long a supporter of civil unions, has publicly embraced same-sex marriage, the question of precisely what legal status and protections should be granted to gay couples is emerging as an issue of the starkest possible contrast between the two presidential candidates.
 In short, both Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama have adopted the favored position of their ideological base on a subject that profoundly animates both of those camps.
 On Wednesday, in anticipation of Mr. Obamaâ€™s announcement, Mr. Romney laid out his belief that marriage â€” and anything resembling it â€” should be restricted to heterosexual couples, even as he acknowledged that it was â€œa very tender and sensitive topic.â€\\x9d
 In doing so, he left open many questions about what his vision of legally recognizable gay unions would encompass, and what it would exclude.
 â€œMy view is the same as itâ€™s been from the beginning,â€\\x9d Mr. Romney told a CBS affiliate in Denver. â€œI donâ€™t favor civil unions if itâ€™s identical to marriage, and I donâ€™t favor marriage between people of the same gender.â€\\x9d Asked why he opposed civil unions, in particular, he explained that in many cases they represent marriage by a different name for gay couples.
 â€œIf a civil union is identical to marriage other than with the name, why, I donâ€™t support that,â€\\x9d he said Wednesday.
 Nine states, including California, Delaware and New Jersey, now allow civil unions and broad domestic partnerships that most likely fit Mr. Romneyâ€™s description of marriage-like arrangements, meaning that they would be in the cross hairs of a President Romney, who supports a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage.
 Those states offer an array of different rights to same-sex couples, among them the ability to pool resources for tax purposes, place a spouse on an employee health care plan and inherit property after a death.
 Mr. Romney has said that he favors allowing domestic partnerships that bestow certain rights on same-sex couples, like hospital visitation, but he has not delineated them in great detail.
 â€œBenefits of that nature may well be appropriate, and states are able to make a provision for the determination of those kinds of rights,â€\\x9d Mr. Romney said Wednesday.
 Republicans and Democrats, in their reactions to the presidentâ€™s support for same-sex marriage, said they saw a newly wide, and seemingly unbridgeable, gap between the two leaders on the issue.
 â€œWe now have a clear choice between Romney and Obama,â€\\x9d said Maggie Gallagher, a founder of the National Organization for Marriage, which opposes same-sex marriage. She called the presidentâ€™s decision â€œa huge mistakeâ€\\x9d that would reward the Republican Party.
 Evan Wolfson, the founder of Freedom to Marry, a gay rights organization, said that now â€œthere is absolutely no way that opponents of gay rights can hide behind any unclarity in the presidentâ€™s position and make the bogus claim that itâ€™s the same as theirs.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Romney has, over the years, made it clear that his opposition to same-sex marriage and civil unions is a deeply held moral conviction, and he has not shied from using strong language to describe the offense he has taken to its introduction.
 When in 2003 the Massachusetts courts legalized same-sex marriage in the state, Mr. Romney, then governor, complained that the state had become â€œSan Francisco East.â€\\x9d And, speaking with a sense of alarm about gay couples, he warned a conservative audience that â€œsome are actually having children born to them.â€\\x9d
 Democrats contend that, like Mr. Obamaâ€™s views, Mr. Romneyâ€™s feelings about gay rights have evolved, but in the opposite direction: During his campaign for the Senate in 1994, Mr. Romney vowed to seek â€œfull equalityâ€\\x9d for gays and lesbians, in a letter to the Log Cabin Republicans of Massachusetts.
 In that letter he argued that he was more supportive of gay rights than his Democratic opponent at the time, Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
 But at the time, same-sex marriage was a little-discussed item on the agenda of national gay rights leaders, and aides say Mr. Romney has consistently opposed both marriage and civil unions that resemble marriage for gay couples.

TITLE: Romney calls on Rep. Akin to drop Senate bid over 'rape' comments

PUBLISHED: 2012/08/21

Mitt Romney joined several other Republicans Tuesday in calling on Missouri Rep. Todd Akin to give up his bid for Senate over his controversial comments on rape, as the Republican congressman continued to hold his ground and vowed to stay in the race.
 Romney added his voice after five past and present Missouri Republican senators urged Akin to step aside. In a statement released Tuesday afternoon, they said his presence does not serve "the national interest."
 "The issues at stake are too big, and this election is simply too important. The right decision is to step aside," they said. The statement came from Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, and former Sens. John Ashcroft, Kit Bond, John Danforth and Jim Talent
 Romney released a statement late Tuesday saying: "As I said yesterday, Todd Akin's comments were offensive and wrong and he should very seriously consider what course would be in the best interest of our country. Today, his fellow Missourians urged him to step aside, and I think he should accept their counsel and exit the Senate race."
 Akin, though, told Fox News host Mike Huckabee on his radio show Tuesday afternoon that he's staying in.
 "I believe that we can win this," Akin said, citing a "tremendous outpouring of support" from individual donors even as party heavyweights freeze him out.
 The Republican congressman is facing a 5 p.m. deadline to withdraw -- after that, he would need a court order to have his name removed from the ballot.
 But Akin rebuffed calls late Monday to step aside and let another Republican candidate take his place. Instead, his campaign released a new ad in which Akin looks into the camera and addresses the controversy surrounding his remarks.
 "Rape is an evil act. I used the wrong words in the wrong way and for that I apologize," he said in the ad. "As the father of two daughters, I want tough justice for predators. I have a compassionate heart for the victims of sexual assault. And I pray for them. The fact is, rape can lead to pregnancy. The truth is, rape has many victims.
 "The mistake I made was in the words I said, not in the heart I hold. I ask for your forgiveness," he said. The video was released after Akin canceled a scheduled television interview Monday night.
 Akin's ad, and claims Monday that he's "going to stay in," defied Republican Party leaders who are nervous the controversy could imperil their chances of taking control of the Senate after the November elections. Akin is challenging Democratic Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill in a race considered key to a GOP Senate majority come 2013.
 A source within the National Republican Senatorial Committee told Fox News that Sen. John Cornyn, head of the Senate GOP campaign arm, already has told Akin that if he stays in the race, the $5 million set aside for the Missouri race will be withdrawn. Cornyn, according to the source, told him the party is concerned his presence in the race could hurt Republicans' chances of winning the Senate majority.
 Akin made the remarks in an interview with Fox affiliate KTVI. He claimed a woman's body can typically fend off pregnancy during a "legitimate rape," as he argued against allowing abortions in cases of rape, claiming such pregnancies are uncommon in the first place.
 "It seems to me first of all, from what I understand from doctors, that's really rare," Akin told KTVI. "If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down."
 Top Senate leaders including Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell have condemned Akin's comments.
 "What he said is just flat wrong in addition to being wildly offensive to any victim of sexual abuse," McConnell said. "Although Rep. Akin has apologized, I believe he should take time with his family to consider whether this statement will prevent him from effectively representing our party in this critical election."
 Republican Sen. Scott Brown, who's in a tough race against Democrat Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts, was the first Republican senator to call on Akin to withdraw from the race.
 Akin apologized for his remarks Monday. He tweeted Monday afternoon: "I am in this race to win."

TITLE: Obama Boehner Fiscal Cliff Meeting: Grasping For Last-Minute Solution

PUBLISHED: 2012/12/13

WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) met for nearly an hour on Thursday evening in their latest attempt to break the impasse on impending tax hikes and spending cuts. True to form, neither said much of anything about what was discussed.
 Shortly after the meeting ended, both camps put out identical, banal statements.
 "The President and Speaker had a frank meeting in the Oval Office tonight," said the statements. "It lasted approximately 50 minutes. There will be no further readout of the meeting, but lines of communication remain open."
 Boehner was back at the Capitol soon afterward, but said nothing new as he passed reporters eager for a readout. â€œNice to see all of you,â€\\x9d he said as he kept walking, CNNâ€™s Deirdre Walsh tweeted. Boehner is heading back to Ohio for the weekend.
 A handful of others attended the meeting. Timothy Geithner, the treasury secretary, and Rob Nabors, director of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs, joined Obama, a White House aide confirmed. Boehnerâ€™s chief of staff, Mike Sommers, and his policy director, Brett Loper, were also in attendance.
 Thursday nightâ€™s meeting marks the second time in a week the president and House speaker have met in person, and comes after at least two phone calls in recent days.
 The continued dialogue provides some rays of hope to a negotiating process that, in recent days, has shown very little progress. Boehner has refused to budge from his refusal to consider raising tax rates on top earners while arguing that heavy spending cuts are needed. The White House, in contrast, has accused House Republican leadership of being deliberately vague on cuts, while insisting that no deal will end up getting the president's signature without a raising of tax rates.
 With the year-end deadline for all rates to expire and $1 trillion in spending cuts to kick in, the prospect of actually failing to find agreement is coming into focus. A top Senate Democratic aide told the Huffington Post on Thursday that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) told his caucus that finalizing a deal by Christmas was now basically impossible.
 Boehner, meanwhile, told lawmakers earlier Thursday not to make plans for Christmas, signaling that there may not realistically be a final deal until the very end of the month. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney wouldnâ€™t say whether Obama is also bracing for dragged out negotiations
 â€œI canâ€™t speculate about the time frame,â€\\x9d Carney said at his daily briefing. â€œWhat the president is interested in is working with Congress to achieve a deal that avoids the fiscal cliff and, beyond that, addresses our long-term fiscal challenges in a balanced way. He wants to makes sure, first and foremost, that the middle class does not have their taxes go up on January 1st.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Battle Over Medicare Savings Intensifies Between Obama and Paul Ryan

PUBLISHED: 2012/08/14

WASHINGTON - Representative Paul D. Ryanâ€™s budget blueprint assumes the same amount of Medicare savings as President Obamaâ€™s health care law, even though Mitt Romney and Mr. Ryan have said those cuts would be devastating to millions of older Americans on Medicare
 As the partisan brawl over Medicare continued on Tuesday and threatened to become the focus of the race, the Obama campaign said that Mr. Ryanâ€™s budget plan â€” broadly endorsed by Mr. Romney â€” â€œwould end Medicare as we know itâ€\\x9d and shift costs to beneficiaries.
 The Republicans hit back on Tuesday with a television commercial asserting that the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan was better for older Americans.
 â€œYou paid into Medicare for years, every paycheck,â€\\x9d the advertisement says. â€œNow when you need it, Obama has cut $716 billion from Medicare. Why? To pay for Obamacare. So now the money you paid for your guaranteed health care is going to a massive new government program thatâ€™s not for you.â€\\x9d
 Lis Smith, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign, said, â€œMitt Romneyâ€™s Medicare ad is dishonest and hypocritical.â€\\x9d The savings, she said, â€œdo not cut a single guaranteed Medicare benefit.â€\\x9d
 In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Mr. Ryan said he welcomed the back and forth.
 â€œThis is a debate we want to have,â€\\x9d he said. â€œWeâ€™re the ones who are offering a plan to save Medicare, to protect Medicare, to strengthen Medicare.â€\\x9d
 With 50 million beneficiaries, Medicare is a major concern for both parties. The current fight centers on changes in the program made in the new health law, the Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010 without Republican votes.
 Mr. Obama would use the savings to help offset the cost of covering the uninsured, as well as to improve the financial condition of the Medicare trust fund. Mr. Ryan says he would use the money to shore up Medicare and to help reduce budget deficits.
 Republicans won control of the House in 2010 partly by arguing that Democrats had raided Medicare to pay for Mr. Obamaâ€™s health care law. Democrats hope to deflect such attacks this year by pointing out that Mr. Ryanâ€™s budget plan, approved twice by the House, includes similar savings â€” roughly $700 billion from 2013 to 2022, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
 Those savings have a complicated history.
 Mr. Ryanâ€™s budget plan was approved in March by the House Budget Committee, of which he is chairman. Before the vote, committee members discussed the budget plan and the Medicare provisions in detail.
 Representative Allyson Y. Schwartz, Democrat of Pennsylvania, asked whether the savings in the Affordable Care Act â€” â€œsometimes referred to as cuts to Medicareâ€\\x9d â€” were part of Mr. Ryanâ€™s budget.
 Austin Smythe, the panelâ€™s Republican staff director, said: â€œWe assume those savings. We devote them to solvency of Medicare and to deficit reduction, instead of covering the expansions.â€\\x9d
 At another point, Mr. Smythe said, â€œWe assume the repeal of all of the expansions in the Affordable Care Act.â€\\x9d
 Those expansions, he said, include subsidies to help low- and middle-income people buy private insurance. Democrats said that repeal of the new law would also wipe out new Medicare benefits, like additional coverage of prescription drugs and preventive services.
 The House approved the Ryan budget plan on March 29 by a vote of 228 to 191, with all but 10 Republicans voting for it.
 Mr. Romney has offered a Medicare proposal similar to Mr. Ryanâ€™s. But the Romney campaign said Tuesday that Mr. Romney would restore the money being squeezed out of Medicare by the 2010 health law.
 â€œMitt Romney and Paul Ryan have always been fully committed to repealing Obamacare, ending President Obamaâ€™s $716 billion raid on Medicare, and tackling the serious fiscal challenges our country faces,â€\\x9d said Lanhee Chen, the policy director for the Romney campaign. â€œA Romney-Ryan administration will restore the funding to Medicare.â€\\x9d
 The Ryan plan, like any budget resolution, specifies levels of spending, savings and revenues, based on certain policy assumptions. But, as Mr. Smythe pointed out, â€œthe committees of jurisdiction determine the detailsâ€\\x9d in separate legislation.
 Mr. Ryan and Mr. Obama would impose similar overall constraints on Medicare spending, stipulating that average spending per beneficiary should not grow faster than the economy, measured by the per capita output of goods and services, plus one-half of one percentage point.
 However, they would achieve the goal in different ways.
 Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney would limit the governmentâ€™s current open-ended financial commitment to Medicare. The government would contribute a fixed amount of money on behalf of each beneficiary, and future beneficiaries could use the money to buy private insurance or to help pay for coverage under the traditional Medicare program.
 The new health care law, by contrast, will reduce projected Medicare payments to health maintenance organizations, hospitals and many other health care providers. As a backstop, to ensure savings, the law creates a Medicare cost control board. Cuts recommended by the board would take effect automatically unless Congress voted to block or change them.
 Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan would abolish the panel, which they describe as a tool for rationing health care.

TITLE: John Boehner: '1 In 3 Chance' Republicans Lose Control Of House

PUBLISHED: 2012/04/23

House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) admitted there's a "1 in 3" chance that the Republicans will lose their majority in the House of Representatives in an interview Tuesday on Fox News' "Americaâ€™s Newsroom."
 "I would say that there is a 2 in 3 chance that we win control of the House again. But thereâ€™s a 1 in 3 chance that we could lose. And Iâ€™m being myself, frank, weâ€™ve got a big challenge and weâ€™ve got work to do," he said to Fox News' Bill Hemmer.
 Expanding on tough races, Boehner said, "We have 50 of our members in tough races; 89 freshmen running for their first re-elections. And we have 32 districts that are in states where there is no presidential campaign going to be run, no big Senate race and we call these orphan districts."
 He went on, "You take 18 of them -- California, Illinois and New York, where you know weâ€™re not likely to do well at the top of the ticket -- and those districts are frankly pretty vulnerable."
 Boehner also dismissed top Obama campaign strategist David Axelrod's comment on Sunday that House Republicans are under a "reign of terror" brought about by the far right of their party. "That that is just outrageous talk," Boehner said. "Theyâ€™re trying to make this election, as I said earlier, about anything other than the presidentâ€™s failed economic policies. And so theyâ€™re going to look for every boogeyman known to man," he said.
 "Listen, if Republicans were walking in lockstep, my job would be a whole lot easier," he added.

TITLE: Michele Bachmann Chick-Fil-A Visit: GOP Rep Shows Support For Company Amid Controversy

PUBLISHED: 2012/08/01

Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) showed her support for Chick-fil-A Wednesday when she tweeted a photo of her visiting the restaurant.
 "Have you gone today?" Bachmann asked her followers on what became an unofficial "Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day."
 The surge of support for the fast-food chain came after Chick-fil-A president Dan Cathy said the Atlanta-based company was "guilty as charged" for backing "the biblical definition of a family." As gay rights groups launched boycotts against the company, prominent conservative figures like former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Senator Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin began showing their support by visiting the restaurant.
 But conservatives weren't the only ones taking sides. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) tweeted about her opposition to the restaurant, and West Hollywood bar The Abbey introduced a "Chick-for-Gay" sandwich as a protest against the chain.

TITLE: Biden Takes Off Gloves in Vice-Presidential Debate

PUBLISHED: 2012/10/12

Joe Biden knew Lloyd Bentsen.
 Lloyd Bentsen was a friend of Joe Bidenâ€™s.
 And the vice president made full use of his old Senate colleagueâ€™s 1988 debate playbook, shaking his head and scoffing pityingly at Representative Paul D. Ryan, trying to paint his opponent as a latter-day Dan Quayle.
 Mr. Ryan was no Dan Quayle, but he did make the mistake of mentioning John F. Kennedy in an argument over whether tax cuts recharge the economy. Mr. Biden flashed a Cheshire Cat grin and said to Ryan, after waiting a beat to let the moment sink in, â€œSo, now youâ€™re Jack Kennedy?â€\\x9d
 The vice presidential debate on Tuesday was supposed to be a reboot for the Obama campaign after the presidentâ€™s dismal performance at his debate with the Republican nominee for president, Mitt Romney, last week. Mr. Biden, clearly delighted to come to President Obamaâ€™s rescue, relished his role, addressing his opponent as â€œmy friendâ€\\x9d but dismissing his arguments as â€œmalarkey.â€\\x9d He laughed at Mr. Ryanâ€™s remarks so often and so heartily that at times he seemed like a guest at a comedy club roast, not a vice president debating the fate of the nation with his opponent.
 It was a sharp and spirited debate, with both candidates delivering some lacerating blows, but Mr. Ryan at times seemed disconcerted by the sheer blowhard intensity Mr. Biden brought to the night. Mr. Ryan tried to be respectful, listening to the vice president with a tilted head, choirboy smile and puppy-dog eyes, but he showed his irritation when Mr. Biden kept interrupting to attack his policy on Medicare. â€œI know youâ€™re under duress,â€\\x9d he told the vice president, prompting another belly laugh.
 For Mr. Biden especially, the night was his chance to relive past debates and unleash his inner barroom brawler. He had to be contained and courteous when he debated Sarah Palin four years ago, lest he look like a bully. This time he let loose. And unlike the courtly Mr. Bentsen in 1988, Mr. Biden turned his temperature up, singeing the young man across the table with patronizing grins, but mostly withering retorts. His interruptive barrage was as relentless as his silent mugging for the camera.
 Mr. Ryan held his own, but did look abashed when Mr. Biden mocked him for opposing the Obama stimulus, yet asking for government funds for his own district. â€œOn two occasions, we â€” we â€” we advocated for constituents who were applying for grants,â€\\x9d Mr. Ryan said stiffly.
 â€œI love that. I love that,â€\\x9d Mr. Biden said. â€œThis was such a bad program, and he writes me a letter saying â€” writes the Department of Energy a letter saying, the reason we need this stimulus â€” it will create growth and jobs.â€\\x9d
 When Mr. Biden went after Mr. Romneyâ€™s infamous remark at a private fund-raiser about the â€œ47 percent,â€\\x9d Mr. Ryan reminded the vice president of his own propensity for gaffes. â€œI think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words donâ€™t come out of your mouth the right way,â€\\x9d he said with a gotcha smile. Mr. Biden was not quite as amused.
 Mr. Biden was not the only one in the room intent on rectifying his predecessorâ€™s mistakes. Martha Raddatz of ABC News was the moderator, and she made a point of speaking forcefully, pushing the candidates to be specific and changing subjects abruptly. She seemed determined to be less passive and sleepy than Jim Lehrer of PBS was as moderator of the Obama-Romney debate.
 Mr. Ryan made a point of praising Mr. Romney, even trying to soften his image by recounting a time when Mr. Romney gave money and attention to a couple whose children were badly injured in a car accident. It wasnâ€™t the best example to use, because it prompted Mr. Biden to describe his own tragedy, when his wife and young daughter were killed in a car crash.
 A version of this article appears in print on October 12, 2012, on page A16 of the New York edition with the headline: Night of Withering Ripostes, Mostly Delivered by Biden.

TITLE: Paul Ryan Challenged On Budget By Georgetown Faculty

PUBLISHED: 2012/04/24

WASHINGTONâ€”Joining a chorus of Catholic bishops , theologians, priests, and social justice leaders, nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have called Representative Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) to task for his misuse of Catholic social teaching in defending his budget, which hurts the poor. The group sent a letter to Rep. Ryan in advance of his appearance on the Catholic campus on Thursday morning to give the Whittington Lecture.
 In their letter to Ryan, the scholars make clear they are not objecting to his speaking on campus, but rather his recent comments defending his budget on Christian grounds.
 â€œOur problem with Representative Ryan is that he claims his budget is based on Catholic social teaching,â€\\x9d said Jesuit Father Thomas J. Reese , one of the organizers of the letter. â€œThis is nonsense. As scholars, we want to join the Catholic bishops in pointing out that his budget has a devastating impact on programs for the poor.â€\\x9d Reese is a senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University.
 The letter quotes the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which wrote several letters to Congress saying â€œa just framework for future budgets cannot rely on disproportionate cuts in essential services to poor persons.â€\\x9d The bishops noted that â€œthe House-passed budget resolution fails to meet these moral criteria.â€\\x9d Last week, Rep. Ryan dismissed the bishopsâ€™ critique, erroneously claiming the letters didnâ€™t represent â€œall the bishops,â€\\x9d a point the USCCB media office denied.
 â€œI am afraid that Chairman Ryanâ€™s budget reflects the values of his favorite philosopher Ayn Rand rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ,â€\\x9d said Father Reese. â€œSurvival of the fittest may be okay for Social Darwinists but not for followers of the gospel of compassion and love.â€\\x9d
 The Georgetown scholars pointed to the devastating impact of cuts in food programs that keep the poor from starvation. From personal experience, they also â€œknow how cuts in Pell Grants will make it difficult for low-income students to pursue their educations at colleges across the nation, including Georgetown.â€\\x9d
 The scholars corrected Mr. Ryan on his use of the Catholic concept of â€œsubsidiarityâ€\\x9d as â€œa rationale gutting government programs.â€\\x9d The scholars say that it is true that â€œIt calls for solutions to be enacted as close to the level of local communities as possible. But it also demands that higher levels of government provide helpâ€”â€˜subsidiumâ€™â€”when communities and local governments face problems beyond their means to address such as economic crises, high unemployment, endemic poverty and hunger.â€\\x9d
 The scholars also gave the Representative a reading assignment: â€œThe Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church,â€\\x9d which was commissioned by John Paul II and published by the Vatican.
 Signing the letter were over a dozen Georgetown Jesuit priests, numerous members of the Theology and other departments including History, Government, Philosophy, School of Foreign Service and School of Nursing & Health Studies.

TITLE: Netanyahu Appears in Conservative Group's Ad

PUBLISHED: 2012/09/20

Israel and Middle East policy have a tendency of surfacing in presidential politics in rather combustible ways. And a new advertisement that will run in areas of Florida with large Jewish populations attempts to stoke anxiety over American policies in the region, using a news clip of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel warning of the risks of a nuclear Iran.
 â€œThe fact is that every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to nuclear arms,â€\\x9d Mr. Netanyahu is shown saying.
 For dramatic effect, a soundtrack fit for an episodic drama like â€œHomelandâ€\\x9d plays as the prime minister continues. â€œThe world tells Israel, â€˜Wait. Thereâ€™s still time.â€™ And I say wait for what? Wait until when?â€\\x9d Then an unseen announcer concludes: â€œThe world needs American strength, not apologies.â€\\x9d
 That line is a not-so-veiled swipe at President Obama. Mitt Romney and other Republicans have criticized his foreign policy as apologetic, toward volatile countries like Iran.
 The group that produced the ad, Secure America Now, is run by two longtime Republican strategists, Nelson Warfield ? and John ?McLaughlin, and ?Pat Caddell, a former aide to Jimmy Carter who is now a Fox News contributor. They have reserved $500,000 of airtime in Fort Myers, West Palm Beach and Miami.
 A senior Israeli official said the government was not consulted on the ad and did not approve it.

TITLE: Obama Medicare Attack In 2008 Targeted McCain For Cutting $800 Billion From Program

PUBLISHED: 2012/08/14

WASHINGTON -- In the wake of Mitt Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as his vice presidential nominee, the politics of Medicare have become almost as complicated as the policy itself.
 The most recent back-and-forth between the Romney and Obama campaigns concerns which candidate would do more harm to people's benefits. While the president's team has pointed to the Republican plan to turn Medicare into a quasi-voucher program -- in which recipients would receive a check to buy either insurance through the private market or traditional Medicare -- the Romney team has responded by noting that Obama took more than $700 billion out of Medicare as part of his health care overhaul.
 "He stole $700 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare," said RNC Chair Reince Priebus. "If any person in this entire debate has blood on their hands in regard to Medicare, it's Barack Obama."
 That rejoinder is now a subject of intense debate. The money being taken out of the system by the Affordable Care Act is mostly derived from limiting the expected rate of growth in the program.
 The savings come predominantly from limiting waste, fraud and abuse, mostly in Medicare Advantage, and are budgeted to help subsidize insurance for people under the ACA. As such, independent fact-checkers and news analysts alike have disputed the Romney campaign's characterization.
 Part of the reason that the Obama campaign is crying foul over this line of criticism, however, may be because it knows how effective it can be. Republicans also used the charge that Obamacare raided Medicare as a primary attack line in the 2010 congressional elections. Two years prior, then-Senator Obama used virtually identical language to beat up on his general election opponent, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.):
 "How would your golden years turn out under John McCain? His health care plan would cut Medicare by $800 billion -- that means a 22 percent cut in benefits. Higher premiums and co-pays ... after a lifetime of work, senior's health care shouldn't be a gamble. John McCain's plan, it's not the change we need."
 Obama made the same argument on the stump.
 "It turns out, Senator McCain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare: $882 billion worth -- $882 billion in Medicare cuts to pay for a ill-conceived, badly thought-through health care plan that won't provide more health care to people, even though Medicare is already facing a looming shortfall," Obama declared at a campaign stop in Roanoke, Va.
 Douglas Holtz-Eakin, McCain's policy director at the time, recalled that the attack originated with a Wall Street Journal article that referenced his saying that McCain would assume savings in Medicare and Medicaid spending to make his health care plan budget neutral. Those savings were expected to come from eliminating fraud and reforming payment policies. The possibility of increasing Medicare premiums for higher-income earners was also floated.
 FactCheck.org rated the Obama ad as "false," noting that the McCain campaign wasn't talking about slashing benefits but limiting waste and slowing the rate of growth. Holtz-Eakin said, "We were looking for efficiencies in delivery a la Managed Medicaid."
 This was a relatively minor aspect of the Obama campaign's assault on McCain's Medicare record. The more substantive criticism concerned McCain's proposal to tax worker health care plans as a way of generating money to give people a new tax credit so that they could buy private insurance.
 "Like Governor Romney has refused to specify how he will pay for his $5 trillion tax cuts weighted toward millionaires, Senator McCain would have cut $1.3 trillion from health care programs to pay for tax cuts while refusing to rule out cutting benefits or to say what he was cutting," Obama's current campaign press secretary, Ben LaBolt, said in an email to The Huffington Post. "President Obama achieved a third as much savings by eliminating unnecessary subsidies to insurances companies and getting waste and fraud out of the system in order to improve seniors' benefits -- saving them $600 a year on prescription drugs and providing them with access to preventive care. Senator McCain and Governor Romney have subsequently opposed the savings that the president identified and demagogued the issue, ironically, since Governor Romney's running mate kept them in his budget."
 But the attack on McCain's accounting was part of the assault nonetheless. And in light of the current debate over Medicare proposals, it could complicate the political dialogue even further. Certainly, as the Washington Examiner's Phillip Klein notes, it will contribute to the general reluctance to talk substantively about Medicare reform out of a concern that it merely invites future attacks.

TITLE: Ryan goes on offense over Medicare, accuses Obama of treating program like 'piggy bank'

PUBLISHED: 2012/08/15

Paul Ryan went on offense Tuesday in response to criticism over his Medicare plan, using an interview with Fox News coupled with a new TV ad to claim President Obamaâ€™s health care plan treats the treasured entitlement like a â€œpiggy bank,â€\\x9d while the â€œRomney-Ryanâ€\\x9d plan preserves it.
 Ryan, in his first one-on-one interview since being named Saturday as Mitt Romneyâ€™s running mate, told Fox News on Tuesday he thinks Medicare can be a winning issue for their campaign.
 "We're the ones who are offering a plan to save Medicare, to protect Medicare, to strengthen Medicare," Ryan said. "We're the ones who are not raiding Medicare to pay for ObamaCare. â€¦ We're the ones continuing the guarantee of Medicare for people in or near retirement."
 He added: â€œPresident Obama is actually damaging Medicare for current seniors. It's irrefutable and that's why I think this is a debate we want to have, and that's the debate we're going to win.â€\\x9d
 The comments signal Ryan and Romney are prepared to dig in and fight back, as Democrats lob charges that Ryan stands for â€œending Medicare as we know it.â€\\x9d
 The Obama campaign used that line Monday in a Web video timed for Romneyâ€™s arrival in Florida, with its large senior population. The video pointed to Ryanâ€™s budget proposals, which include significant changes to Medicare.
 The Romney campaign retorted with an ad of its own Tuesday. The ad says: â€œYou paid in to Medicare for years â€¦ now when you need it, Obama has cut $716 billion from Medicare. Why? To pay for ObamaCare.â€\\x9d
 Ryan told Fox News the campaign is trying to show the â€œclear contrastâ€\\x9d between what Republicans propose and what Obamaâ€™s health care law does. Ryan wants to make changes to Medicare for those retiring a decade from now but leave benefits for current retirees and those retiring soon in place.
 â€œThey turned Medicare into a piggy bank to finance ObamaCare,â€\\x9d Ryan said. â€œAnd we want to point that out. And we want to â€¦ restore those cuts to prevent that raid. â€¦ And so we propose no changes to anybody in or near retirement so that the guarantee of Medicare is for them. That's a clear contrast with President Obama's plan.â€\\x9d
 The Obama campaign is disputing that argument. Obama campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith described the new Romney-Ryan ad on the subject as â€œdishonest and hypocritical,â€\\x9d considering Ryanâ€™s own proposals for Medicare.
 â€œThe savings his ad attacks do not cut a single guaranteed Medicare benefit, and Mitt Romney embraced the very same savings when he promised heâ€™d sign Paul Ryanâ€™s budget,â€\\x9d Smith said. â€œBecause the president is eliminating subsidies to insurance companies and cutting waste and fraud, weâ€™ve extended the life of Medicare by eight years. The truth is that the Romney-Ryan budget would end Medicare as we know it: people with Medicare would be left with nothing but a voucher in place of the guaranteed benefits they rely on today.â€\\x9d
 Both sides are being selective in how they describe each otherâ€™s plans.
 The Ryan proposal, submitted again in the House earlier this year, would a decade from now give seniors government payments to purchase private plans or stay within the current system. Ryan says this is to preserve Medicare, not â€œendâ€\\x9d it, as Obamaâ€™s campaign claims.
 But while Ryan slams the health care overhaul for cutting Medicare, even he acknowledged that his own plan achieves â€œsavingsâ€\\x9d for Medicare in the long run. Though he doesnâ€™t use the word â€œcuts,â€\\x9d the plan would slow the rate of benefit growth for seniors according to the Congressional Budget Office.
 And the ObamaCare cuts he referenced would likely come in the form of lower payments to providers. A Romney campaign aide, though, said â€œthatâ€™s a distinction without a differenceâ€\\x9d since the â€œprovider passes that reduction along toâ€\\x9d patients.
 In his interview with Fox News, Ryan also hammered Obama for what he called his â€œutter failure when it comes to creating jobs.â€\\x9d Amplifying the Romney campaign message, he said Obamaâ€™s heavy borrowing is dragging down economic growth â€“ he also claimed the â€œhope and change campaign of '08 has become the blame and attack campaign of 2012.â€\\x9d
 Ryan offered new insight as well on how Romney and Ryan came to bond in the months before he was announced as running mate.
 He recalled when he was campaigning with Romney earlier this year ahead of the Wisconsin primary.
 â€œWe spent about five days on the road, five working hour or so days,â€\\x9d he said. â€œAnd in between all of those stops, driving from, you know, Appleton to Green Bay to Janesville to Milwaukee, we got to know each other. We conversed on policy issues, on where to take the country. And sooner or later, we basically started sharing the microphones at these town hall meetings and we just kind of developed a chemistry with one another and a mutual understanding with each other.â€\\x9d
 Ryan said he doesnâ€™t know whether he had a â€œspecial placeâ€\\x9d but it was â€œvery clear we thought the same on these issues.â€\\x9d
 â€œWhen he asked me to join the ticket, he basically said to me, 'You share my values and you have the kind of experience that could be a complement to my experience to getting this country back on track, to creating jobs, to getting people back to work, to saving this country from a debt crisis,'" Ryan said.
 Ryan also discussed his affection for novelist Ayn Rand, saying â€œAtlas Shruggedâ€\\x9d triggered his interest in economics. He said he doesnâ€™t share her overall philosophy but said her books â€œshowed how the pitfalls of socialism can hurt the economy.â€\\x9d
 Obama, meanwhile, took on Ryan for the second straight day Tuesday, using a stop in Oskaloosa, Iowa, to criticize Ryanâ€™s and Romneyâ€™s tax plan.
 â€œYou may have heard that Governor Romney just chose his running mate, Congressman Ryan. He's a good man. He's a family man. He's the ideological leader of the Republicans in Congress,â€\\x9d Obama said. â€œAnd he's an articulate spokesperson for Governor Romney's views. The problem is, those views are wrong.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Romney reaffirms belief in marriage as between man, woman

PUBLISHED: 2012/05/09

Following President Obama's comments in a TV interview expressing his support for same-sex marriage, his likely GOP rival Mitt Romney said Wednedsay he maintains his opposition to it -- the same position he's had since he "started running for office"
 "I have the same view on marriage that I had when I was governor and that I expressed many times. I believe marriage is between a man and a woman," he told reporters following an event at the Oklahoma Republican Party headquartersk, where he garnered the endorsement of Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin.
 Obama made the groundbreaking news in an interview with ABC.
 "It is important for me personally to go ahead and affirm that same-sex couples should be able to get married," Obama stated. He previously had said he supported equal rights for same-sex couples but stopped short of endorsing gay marriage.
 When asked if he believed the president had flip-flopped on the issue, Romney said it's up to the public to be the judge.
 â€œI believe that based upon the interview that he gave today on ABC it said that he had changed his view, but youâ€™re a better judge of that than I," Romney said. "I just saw the reports that he had previously said he opposed same-sex marriage and now according to ABC News he saying that he supports it. If thatâ€™s the case then youâ€™ll be able to make that determination on your own."
 Last year Romney had signed a pledge sponsored by the National Organization for Marriage promising to support a federal ammendment defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. On Wednedsay, though, he said that the rights of domestic partners should be decided by the states.
 â€œStates are able to make decisions with regards to domestic partnership benefits such as hospital visitation rights, benefits and so forth of various kinds can be determined state by state," Romney said.
 Following Romney's news conference, Obama's campaign immediately pounced on the former governor's comments.
 Ben Labolt tweeted, "@MittRomney just refused to say he supports hospital visitation rights at a federal level for gays and lesbians."

TITLE: Netanyahu appears in conservative political ad airing in Florida

PUBLISHED: 2012/09/20

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said heâ€™ll steer clear of the American presidential election, but he stars in a new ad set to air in the key battleground state of Florida that aims to make Iran a major campaign issue.
 Netanyahu, who has a famously frosty relationship with President Obama, mentions neither Obama nor Republican challenger Mitt Romney, with whom Netanyahu worked in the mid-1970s at Boston Consulting Group. His words are taken from a recent news conference, in which he expressed frustration at the Obama administrationâ€™s failure to establish â€œred linesâ€\\x9d for reining in Iran and its rogue nuclear weapons program.
 "The fact is that every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to a nuclear bomb,â€\\x9d Netanyahu says. â€œThe world tells Israel, wait, there's still time. And I say wait for what? Wait until when?"
 A voice-over at the end of the ad underscores the prime minister's message: "The world needs American strength, not apologies."
 The ad, paid for by nonprofit conservative advocacy group Secure America Now, could have a powerful influence in heavily-Jewish markets, including Miami. Florida is considered a toss-up in recent polling, and its 29 electoral votes could swing the election.
 â€œSizable majorities in both states believe that Iran will share nuclear weapons with terrorists,â€\\x9d said Jeri Thompson, advisory board member for Secure America Now. â€œSupport for Israel remains strong. In short, (Netanyahu's) a powerful messenger with a powerful message who the American people believe.â€\\x9d
 The ad, reportedly to air in Miami, West Palm Beach and Fort Myers, is costing Secure America $1 million, the organization confirmed to Fox News.
 A Fox News poll released Wednesday shows Obama leading Romney, 49 percent to 44 percent, in Florida.
 Meanwhile, Haaretz reported that the Republican Jewish Coalition has launched a separate $5 million TV advertising blitz aimed at Jewish voters in swing states. That campaign started Wednesday and runs through Nov. 5 in cable and broadcast TV markets in Florida, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
 "This ad highlights the 'buyer's remorse' felt by many in the Jewish community, who voted for Obama four years ago but are now disillusioned with his economic policies and his policies toward Israel,â€\\x9d the coalition's executive director, Matt Brooks, said in a written statement Wednesday. â€œThese ads, and the stories of the people in them, give voice to the nagging doubts that many Jewish voters feel about President Obama. To underscore that point, numerous polls have shown an erosion in Jewish support for the president."
 Netanyahu also made an appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press" last Sunday, urging Obama to take a tougher line with Iran over its nuclear program.
 "President Obama has said that he is determined to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons," he said on the Sunday morning show. "If you're determined to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons, it means you'll act before they get nuclear weapons."

TITLE: Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day brings out supporters, protesters

PUBLISHED: 2012/08/01

It used to be that taking a bite of a chicken sandwich just meant you were hungry. Now it has become a symbol of whether you stand for or against same-sex marriage, or â€“ alternately â€“ the right to express your personal views without fear of retaliation.
 At Chick-fil-A locations across the country, people voted with their wallets today, coming out to express support for the fast-food chain after CEO Dan Cathy said in an interview that he is a firm backer of traditional marriage.
 â€œI believe what the Bible says (about marriage),â€\\x9d Chauncy Fields told us after wolfing down a breakfast of chicken and biscuits. â€œSo I came out here to support Chick-fil-A and the movement.â€\\x9d
 Chris Johnson sees a double standard. â€œHe (Dan Cathy) said the exact same thing that President Obama said,â€\\x9d Johnson told Fox News -- referring to the presidentâ€™s past opposition to gay marriage â€“ â€œAnd he gets negativity, and Obama gets positivity.â€\\x9d
 At one Atlanta location, the restaurant was packed, while the line for the drive-thru looped twice around the building and out into the street.
 The backlash across the country against Chick-fil-A has been ferocious. After the mayors of Chicago and Boston heaped scorn upon the company, the mayor of Washington, DC, suggested it was peddling â€œhate chicken.â€\\x9d
 Those comments drew a sharp response from Rev. William Owens of the Coalition of African American Pastors. â€œSome people are saying that because of the position that Chick-fil-A is taking, they donâ€™t want them in their cities. It is a disgrace. It is the same thing that happened when I was marching for civil rights, when they didnâ€™t want a black to come into their restaurant," he told a press conference in Washington, DC.
 The Chick-fil-A firestorm has taken on different meanings for different people. For some, it harks to the days of intolerance and segregation. For others, it is about religious views of marriage. But for most people who Fox News spoke to today, it is about free speech.
 â€œI think it comes down to a First Amendment issue. I mean, I do believe in the traditional values of marriage between a man and a woman,â€\\x9d youth pastor Stephen Lenahan told Fox News after a leisurely breakfast with three members of his ministry. He is also puzzled as to why Dan Cathy is such a target, when other corporate CEOs who openly support same-sex marriage are not similarly criticized by conservatives.
 Lenahan says he sees a bigger issue at work here. â€œThere is kind of a culture war going on and people arenâ€™t really respecting each other and difference of opinion. Thereâ€™s no dialogue taking place to get to the heart of what we really believe as a nation and what is truth.â€\\x9d
 Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day â€“ as it is being called was the idea of former Arkansas governor and Fox News contributor Mike Huckabee. But as protests against Chick-fil-A swelled across the country, dozens of groups and prominent individuals joined in support of the company.
 Among the groups is Project 21, a black conservative activist organization. One of its members, Demetrios Minor, said critics of Dan Cathy have taken his statements completely out of context. â€œI think liberals are missing a vital point in their blind hatred of Chick-fil-A,â€\\x9d Minor said in a statement sent to Fox News. â€œBeing against gay marriage is not being anti-gay.â€\\x9d
 Crtitics of Chick-fil-A argue that the companyâ€™s opposition to gay marriage goes well beyond Dan Cathyâ€™s statements. Over the years, its philanthropic wing, WinShape, has donated millions of dollars to outside organizations that actively lobby against efforts to legalize same-sex marriage.
 On Friday, supporters of same-sex marriage will have their say. They plan a â€œkiss-inâ€\\x9d at Chick-fil-A restaurants across the country â€“ encouraging gays and lesbians to share a public display of affection at the home of the chicken sandwich.

TITLE: Romney: My 'Preference' Is Marriage Between A Man And A Woman

PUBLISHED: 2012/05/09

Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on Wednesday reiterated that he opposes same-sex marriage, a few hours after President Barack Obama said for the first time he supports it.
 "My view is that marriage itself is a relationship between a man and a woman and that's my own preference," Romney told reporters in Oklahoma. "I know other people have differing views. This is a very tender and sensitive topic, as are many social issues, but I have the same view that I've had since running for office."
 Obama came out in support of same-sex marriage on Wednesday in an interview with ABC. The announcement prompted a flurry of responses, from Democrats praising his statements to Republicans decrying them.
 Romney said he supports states' rights to make decisions on domestic partnership benefits, including hospital visitation. Obama, while saying he personally supports same-sex marriage, also said the issue should be left to the states to decide.
 Romney's comments were far more measured than some other Republicans, who have openly accused the president of disrespecting religion and using the issue for political gain. Former GOP candidate Rick Santorum, for example, put out a statement shortly after Romney's remarks that claimed Obama "has consistently fought against protecting the institution of marriage from radical social engineering at both the state and federal level."
 When asked whether Obama flip-flopped on same-sex marriage -- an accusation Romney has some experience with -- the presumptive Republican presidential nominee acknowledged the president's change, but said he'd leave the significance for others to decide.
 â€œI believe that, based upon the interview he gave today on ABC, it said that he had changed his view, but youâ€™re a better judge of that than I am," Romney said. â€œI just saw the reports that he had previously said he opposed same sex marriage and now, according to ABC News, he said that he supports it. So if thatâ€™s the case youâ€™ll have to make that determination on your own."
 Romney told a local Denver TV station earlier on Wednesday that he opposes both same-sex marriage and civil unions.
 "Well, when these issues were raised in my state of Massachusetts, I indicated my view, which is I do not favor marriage between people of the same gender, and I do not favor civil unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name," Romney told Denver Fox affiliate KDVR-TV.

TITLE: With Abortion in the Spotlight, a Challenge for Romney

PUBLISHED: 2012/08/21

HOUSTON â€” The decision by Republican convention delegates to oppose abortion without explicit exceptions for rape and incest poses a tricky political challenge for Mitt Romney as he prepares to accept the presidential nomination in Tampa, Fla., next week.
 The vote puts the Republican Party at odds with Mr. Romney, who supports rape and incest exceptions, at a time that controversial comments by Representative Todd Akin, the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri, have increased national scrutiny on the divisive social issue.
 Mr. Akin said over the weekend that womenâ€™s bodies will resist getting pregnant from a â€œlegitimate rape,â€\\x9d comments that have been widely condemned, including by Mr. Romney who called for Mr. Akin to withdraw from the race.
 â€œToday, his fellow Missourians urged him to step aside, and I think he should accept their counsel and exit the Senate race,â€\\x9d Mr. Romney said in a statement, citing former Missouri senators like John Ashcroft, Kit Bond, John Danforth and Jim Talent.
 But Mr. Akin on Tuesday refused to step down from his race despite loud calls from his partyâ€™s leaders to abandon his bid.
 Aides to Mr. Romney declined to say on Tuesday whether he would call on the convention delegates to reconsider their position on abortion. Calls and e-mails to a half-dozen advisers on the subject were not returned on Tuesday.
 Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, tried to deflect questions on behalf of Mr. Romney, saying on Fox News that â€œthis is the platform of the Republican Party, it is not the platform of Mitt Romney.â€\\x9d
 The reluctance to talk about the platform reflects the delicate position that Mr. Romney is in when it comes to abortion policy.
 A supporter of abortion rights early in his political career, Mr. Romney later switched his position. This year, he captured the nomination of a party whose hard-core activists remained suspicious of Mr. Romneyâ€™s late-in-life conversion to their cause.
 But as he prepares to accept that nomination next week in Tampa, Mr. Romney is once again being forced to carefully navigate between the uncompromising antiabortion positions of his partyâ€™s base and the more moderate politics of the swing voters he needs to win over.
 The vote on the platform is an important part of the Republican Partyâ€™s outreach to its conservative base. Mr. Romney and his aides have worked hard to ensure that social conservatives at the convention â€” and the voters they represent â€” do not feel left out.
 The party platform â€” and the positions taken on abortion, same-sex marriage and other social issues â€” are a key part of that effort.
 If Mr. Romney were to reject the partyâ€™s tough abortion plank, it would send a politically difficult message to conservatives about how Mr. Romney might govern once he got into the White House.
 There could also be a flurry of conservative outrage at the convention, which could distract from the carefully choreographed event Mr. Romneyâ€™s strategists are planning.
 But Mr. Romneyâ€™s campaign is also trying hard to make sure that the convention projects an image that swing voters in battleground states will find appealing. Aides did not expect to be focusing heavily on the partyâ€™s abortion positions this week.
 The campaign has already chosen in the last several weeks to move off its core message about jobs and the economy. The convention is intended to return the campaignâ€™s message to one of how Mr. Romney will get the nationâ€™s economy back on track.
 In the current political environment involving Mr. Akinâ€™s comments, a decision by Mr. Romney to accept the partyâ€™s abortion plank will open his campaign to attacks from his rivals that he is out of step with moderate, independent voters.
 Democrats have already pounced. Officials with the Democratic National Committee quickly called the Republican abortion position the â€œAkin plankâ€\\x9d and scheduled a news conference to denounce it.
 â€œAmerican women know that Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan and the party they lead are the wrong choice for women and their families,â€\\x9d a statement from the Democratic committee said. â€œMitt Romney should do the right thing and denounce this dangerous language.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Obama and Boehner Talk Deficits at the White House

PUBLISHED: 2012/12/09

WASHINGTON â€” With just three weeks left for lawmakers to avert a fiscal crisis, President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner met privately at the White House on Sunday as a top Republican senator suggested that his party should perhaps accede to Mr. Obamaâ€™s demand to raise the top tax rates so that the attention can shift to making serious cuts in benefit programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
 Administration officials would not offer details of the discussion between Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner. But the disclosure of the meeting indicated that private discussions continue in the face of Republican leadersâ€™ public statements deploring the lack of progress and the presidentâ€™s refusal so far to specify the sort of deep, long-term reductions in spending for social programs that they insist upon as a condition of their support for raising taxes on high earners.
 The White House and Mr. Boehnerâ€™s office issued identical statements afterward that said â€œthe lines of communication remain open.â€\\x9d
 The meeting was the first face-to-face negotiation between the president and the speaker since a session three weeks ago, when they were joined by the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California; the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada; and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. They were the first one-on-one deficit talks between Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner since the summer of 2011, when the search for a â€œgrand bargainâ€\\x9d on taxes and spending ultimately failed.
 The latest meeting gave rise to renewed optimism that a deal could be reached before the end of the month.
 â€œMy guess is still that we will reach a deal, but I do not think that anything is either certain or imminent,â€\\x9d Representative Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican and Boehner lieutenant, said Sunday night. â€œIf they reach a deal, I suspect the majority of our conference will support the speaker. I hope the president can command equal support on his side of the aisle.â€\\x9d
 Any optimism is a step forward from Friday, when Mr. Boehner told reporters that he did not have a progress report because there was â€œno progress to report.â€\\x9d
 But the ups and downs of the search for a deal to avert a fiscal crisis have been in large measure for public consumption. Between public statements and news conferences, the staffs of the president and the speaker have been in close contact.
 Just hours before the White House meeting, Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said on â€œFox News Sundayâ€\\x9d that a small but growing group of Republicans had begun considering acquiescing on tax rates so that the negotiations could shift to entitlement programs.
 Mr. Corker, a member of the Banking Committee who had presented a deficit-reduction plan of his own, said that if Republicans gave in to the presidentâ€™s chief demand, then â€œall of a sudden the shift goes back to entitlements, and maybe it puts us in a place where we actually can do something that really saves the nation.â€\\x9d
 Republicans have been insisting that the Obama administration agree to substantial savings in entitlement programs as the two sides negotiate how to narrow the countryâ€™s huge deficits. But Mr. Corker is part of a group of Republicans who say the party will ultimately have to yield to the Obama demand of higher tax rates for top earners, potentially back to the levels that prevailed under President Bill Clinton.
 That group of Republicans, Mr. Corker said on Fox, was beginning to realize â€œthat we donâ€™t have a lot of cards as it relates to the tax issue before year endâ€\\x9d â€” but that a tax-rate concession could be converted, jujitsu style, into a tactical advantage.
 Mr. Corkerâ€™s comments came as central figures on network news programs mixed cautious words of optimism over the negotiations between the White House and Congressional Republicans with dire warnings about what a failure to act might bring.
 Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned that such a failure was the gravest threat now facing the still-fragile United States economy â€” greater than the European debt crisis or any uncertainty in China.
 â€œIt would result in the stock market really taking a hit,â€\\x9d Ms. Lagarde said on the CNN program â€œState of the Union.â€\\x9d The overall result could be zero growth next year, not the 2.1 percent growth rate projected by the I.M.F.
 She called for a â€œbalancedâ€\\x9d agreement of both revenue increases and spending cuts. That is a word Mr. Obama has often used to describe his preferred outcome. Ms. Lagarde offered a tentative prediction that what she called American â€œpragmatismâ€\\x9d would prevail and avert the worst outcome.

TITLE: Obama, Boehner meet on fiscal crisis for first time in weeks

PUBLISHED: 2012/12/10

President Obama was heading to Detroit Monday afternoon to continue campaigning for tax hikes on top earners -- a day after a face-to-face meeting with House Speaker John Boehner that offered slight hope the two could be making progress toward a deal.
 The president and the speaker met Sunday afternoon at the White House for the first time in weeks. It came after Boehner publicly chided Obama on Friday for the lack of progress to date, accusing the president of having "wasted another week."
 Both sides were tightlipped about the surprise Sunday afternoon meeting. But instead of emerging from the talks complaining about each other, as was the case following phone calls last week, each side released an identical statement.
 "This afternoon, the President and Speaker Boehner met at the White House to discuss efforts to resolve the fiscal cliff. We're not reading out details of the conversation, but the lines of communication remain open," the statement released by each office said.
 Lawmakers and the White House have three weeks to reach a deal, before a potentially crippling set of tax hikes and spending cuts takes effect.
 Boehner last week put a counter-proposal on the table that included $800 billion in revenue increases over the next decade. While Boehner cast that as a significant concession, Obama said it didn't go far enough because it didn't include an increase in tax rates for the top 2 percent.
 Boehner, though, is facing some pressure from Republicans to give a little bit more.
 The speaker is effectively caught between two competing wings of the Republican Party. Some say Congress should not raise any taxes, and were disappointed he went so far as to put any revenue on the table. However, a growing number of Republicans are suggesting the party should give Obama what he wants on tax rates -- and focus instead on winning entitlement cuts once that is cleared away.
 Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., became the latest Republican to open the door to tax rate hikes during an interview on "Fox News Sunday."
 "There is a growing group of folks that are looking at this and realizing that we don't have a lot of cards as it relates to the tax issue, before year-end. I mean, we have one house, that's it," Corker said.
 Corker suggested that Republicans instead focus on extracting entitlement cuts as part of the debt-ceiling negotiations.
 "Republicans know that they have the debt ceiling that's coming up right around the corner, and the leverage is going to shift, as soon as we get beyond this issue," Corker said on "Fox News Sunday." "The leverage is going to shift to our side, where hopefully we'll do the same thing we did last time."
 Corker said that if the president wants to raise the debt limit by $2 trillion, Republicans should press for $2 trillion in spending cuts.
 That prospect is sure to infuriate the White House. After the bruising debt-ceiling fight from 2011, Obama recently warned that he will not "play that game" again. "We've got to break that habit before it starts," the president said.
 The president argues that fights over the debt ceiling merely shake global confidence in the country's ability to pay its bills, and as part of talks over the looming fiscal crisis has called for a de facto permanent increase in the debt limit.
 It's unclear whether Obama might drop that demand if he gets what he wants on tax rates.
 His campaign-style visit to Detroit, though, threatens to muddy the waters on talks.
 Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the No. 3 Republican in the House, suggested Sunday that the president's itinerary has left Republicans to negotiate with themselves.
 "He's been to Pennsylvania. Tomorrow he is going to Detroit. It's now time to govern. The election is over," he said on NBC's "Meet the Press."
 Democratic Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin countered that Obama "is a phone call away and you know it."

TITLE: Santorum Defends Comments on Obama and Education

PUBLISHED: 2012/02/19

Updated: Rick Santorum on Sunday tried to clarify his comment that President Obama subscribed to a â€œphony theology,â€\\x9d saying he was referring not to the presidentâ€™s faith but to his view of manâ€™s relationship to the world.
 It was during a campaign stop in Ohio on Saturday that Mr. Santorum described what he called the â€œphony theologyâ€\\x9d of Mr. Obamaâ€™s agenda.
 â€œItâ€™s about some phony ideal, some phony theology. Oh, not a theology based on the Bible, a different theology,â€\\x9d he said. â€œBut no less a theology.â€\\x9d
 On Sunday, Robert Gibbs, a political adviser to President Obama, criticized such attacks on â€œcharacter and faith.â€\\x9d
 â€œI canâ€™t help but think that those remarks are well over the line. Itâ€™s wrong. Itâ€™s destructive,â€\\x9d Mr. Gibbs said on the ABC News program â€œThis Week,â€\\x9d adding that it reflected the â€œnastiness, divisiveness, uglinessâ€\\x9d and distortions of a hard-fought Republican nominating process.
 Mr. Santorum, at another appearance on Saturday, in Columbus, Ohio, called the idea of schools being run by the federal government or by state governments â€œanachronistic.â€\\x9d Mr. Santorum did not say public schools were a bad idea, and he said that there was a role for government help in education.
 â€œWhere did they come up that public education and bigger education bureaucracies was the rule in America?â€\\x9d he said. â€œParents educated their children, because itâ€™s their responsibility to educate their children.â€\\x9d
 â€œYes the government can help,â€\\x9d Mr. Santorum added. â€œBut the idea that the federal government should be running schools, frankly â€” much less that the state government should be running schools â€” is anachronistic. It goes back to the time of industrialization of America when people came off the farms where they did home-school or have the little neighborhood school, and into these big factories, so we built equal factories called public schools. And while those factories as we all know in Ohio and Pennsylvania have fundamentally changed, the factory school has not.â€\\x9d
 Asked about those remarks on the CBS News program â€œFace the Nation,â€\\x9d Mr. Santorum, who with his wife has home-schooled their children, remained adamant on Sunday.
 While he said he did not oppose government financing of schools, Mr. Santorum said that â€œpublic education should be a dynamic process thatâ€™s locally run.â€\\x9d
 â€œI think the parent should be in charge,â€\\x9d he added, â€œworking with the local school district to try to design an educational environment for each child that optimizes their potential.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Santorum also defended his criticism of a requirement in the presidentâ€™s health-care policy that insurance companies to cover prenatal testing. He had said earlier that the policy was included to save money â€œbecause free prenatal testing ends up in more abortions and therefore less care that has to be done, because we cull the ranks of the disabled in our society.â€\\x9d
 The former Pennsylvania senator has a 3-year-old daughter, Bella, with a serious chromosomal disorder, and he said that doctors who detect such a condition before birth typically recommend abortion.
 Asked whether he was suggesting that Mr. Obama lacked sympathy for the disabled, Mr. Santorum did not back down, saying, â€œI think the president has a very bad record on the issue of abortion and children who are disabled.â€\\x9d
 One of Mr. Santorumâ€™s rivals for the Republican nomination, Representative Ron Paul of Texas, scoffed at Mr. Santorum on Sunday for focusing on social issues like abortion and contraception â€“ and for believing that he could defeat Mr. Obama.
 â€œWell, I donâ€™t see how thatâ€™s possible,â€\\x9d Mr. Paul said on the CNN program â€œState of the Union.â€\\x9d
 â€œAnd this whole idea about talking about the social issues and who is going to pay for birth control pills,â€\\x9d Mr. Paul said. â€œIâ€™m worried about undermining our civil liberties, the constant wars going on, the debt of $16 trillion. And they are worried about birth control pills?â€\\x9d

TITLE: Israel Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu Used In Conservative Attack Ad Against Obama

PUBLISHED: 2012/09/20

Even though Bibi Netanyahu recently decried the use of his name in election-year politicking, the Israeli prime minister is the subject of a new ad by Secure America Now, a neoconservative nonprofit organization dedicated to influencing the debate around American security and foreign policy.
 Politico reports:
 â€œA Republican involved with the project said itâ€™s airing in Miami, West Palm Beach and Ft. Myers. The flight is ultimately going to be $1 million, the official said - a media-tracking source said about $400,000 has been placed so far.
 Those markets house some of the stateâ€™s largest Jewish communities.
 The pollster for Secure America Now is John McLaughlin, who has worked with Netanyahuâ€™s Likud Party.â€\\x9d
 The ad features Netanyahu laying out Israelâ€™s security concerns about Iranâ€™s nuclear program, which Republicans have used to knock President Barack Obamaâ€™s sometimes frosty relationship with the Israeli prime minister.
 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has repeatedly targeted the Obama administration for not taking a firm enough stance against Iran, claiming on many occasions that the president has â€œthrown Israel under a bus.â€\\x9d The GOP also has attacked the president for declining an opportunity to meet with Netanyahu at the United Nations General Assembly later this month in an effort to paint the current White House as dismissive of Israel and its concerns.
 But Netanyahu pushed back against these criticisms in two separate interviews on Sunday, first telling CNN, â€œI know that people are trying to draw me into the American election. Iâ€™m not going to do that.â€\\x9d
 He also rejected reports that Obama refused his request for a meeting, pinning the circumstances on a scheduling conflict, as has the White House when pressed on the subject.
 â€œPresident Obama has said that heâ€™s determined to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons and I appreciate that and I respect that,â€\\x9d Netanyahu said on NBCâ€™s â€œMeet the Press.â€\\x9d
 When asked if Obama had thrown Israel under a bus, Netanyahu responded, â€œThere is no bus.â€\\x9d
 This isnâ€™t the first ad Secure America Now has run against Obama, even though on its website the organization describes itself as representing all political ideologies. In July, the group released an ad pushing the same attack line employed by Romney, accusing the president of embarking on a so-called â€œapology tourâ€\\x9d at the expense of American security.
 The Obama administration is not mentioned by name in the latest spot, but it implicitly underscores the GOPâ€™s narrative on the presidentâ€™s relationship with the countryâ€™s closest ally.

DANVILLE, Ky. â€“- Joe Biden did everything President Barack Obama did not last week, and a good bit more.
 The vice president dominated the spotlight in the only debate between himself and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), charging at Republican Mitt Romney's running mate from the get-go and bombarding him with a flurry of eye rolls, interjections and accusations.
 What it accomplished among undecided voters, if anything, is hard to tell and will take days to sort out. Two instant surveys of Americans watching the debate -- one by CBS, one by CNN -- showed mixed results. But since vice presidential debates often have a negligible impact on the overall race anyway, Biden's sometimes over-the-top performance probably accomplished what he appeared intent on doing: rallying the Democratic base after Obama's woeful debate performance last week.
 Obama, at least, was cheered by the offensive.
 "I'm going to make a special point of saying that I thought Joe Biden was terrific tonight," the president told reporters after stepping off Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, on his way back to the White House after a day of campaigning in Florida.
 Biden looked as if he could barely stay in his seat for much of the night, interrupting Ryan repeatedly and sometimes making it difficult for the GOP nominee to get out his answers.
 â€œHe had his Red Bull. He certainly had his caffeine,â€\\x9d Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said after the debate.
 It was a performance by the vice president guaranteed to amp up -â€“ and buck up -â€“ worried Democrats, who had fallen into a paralysis of anxiety after the president's debate. No one represented that Democratic angst more than blogger Andrew Sullivan, a supporter of the president.
 Obama adviser David Axelrod said "Andrew is a unique thinker, and I can't speak for how he might react to this. I hope he is [reassured]," Axelrod said, adding that he had "high regard for [Sullivan] by the way."
 Sullivan, for the record, called the night "a solid win for Biden" and called Ryan "competent."
 The Obama campaign team, in the spin room after the debate, focused on repeating the theme that, as Axelrod said, Biden showed "passion" and that he showed "a great concern for the middle class." Passion was the thing Obama lacked last week, and Romney surprised the president and Democrats by talking constantly about how his policies would help the middle class.
 By contrast, Romney operatives in the spin room said Ryan clearly won on substance and composure while Biden devolved into fits of laughter and audible groans.
 â€œI think the way the vice president handled himself was condescending,â€\\x9d said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah). â€œHe was constantly interrupting and trying to talk over people. When my 11-year-old tries to do that at the dinner table, itâ€™s not tolerated.â€\\x9d
 Democrats were intent Thursday night to steal back any edge Romney might have deprived them of in being the party who can appeal to working class and blue-collar voters, and to any voter who considers themselves middle class, which is a large number.
 "These guys discovered the phrase 'middle class' during the last six months on the campaign trail," said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who has sparred with Ryan on the House Budget Committee for years and who played Ryan in debate preparation with Biden.
 Though it was Biden at the center of attention and who made it hard for Ryan to get in a word edgewise at times, the 42-year-old kept his composure for much of the night and got in some well-aimed shots at the vice president, who at 69 is his senior by 27 years. Ryan seemed focused more on winning over moderate and independent voters who are still making up their minds, less than a month before the election.
 The night's 90-minute debate, the only one for the two vice presidential candidates, fluctuated between domestic policy and foreign policy, with ABC's Martha Raddatz, a reporter with vast foreign policy experience, asking numerous questions about events overseas.
 But the number one goal for Biden all night was obvious from the outset: push back. Hard. It was the number one thing that Democrats had said Obama should have done last week, and it foreshadowed how the president will approach next Tuesday's debate with Romney, the second of three debates for the two men running for president.
 After Ryan finished his opening statement, responding to a question about the death of the U.S. ambassador to Libya in a terrorist attack in Benghazi a month ago, Biden responded: "That's a bunch of malarkey."
 "Not a single thing he said is accurate," Biden said.
 At times, Biden repeatedly butted in on Ryan's answers, refusing to let Ryan finish his thought. If it were anyone other than Biden, who is treated by the press as a lovable, half-crazy uncle, he would have been labeled insufferable. Instead, he got the aggressive label.
 Republicans thought it was much more than that. Republican National Committee spokesman Tim Miller called Biden â€œunhinged.â€\\x9d
 Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom tweeted: â€œRyan: serious, sober, steady. Biden: smirking, mocking, immature.â€\\x9d
 Some of the more experienced Republicans tried to resist talking about Bidenâ€™s behavior, knowing it would come across as complaining.
 â€œMost people probably found the vice presidentâ€™s performance a little -- well anyway, I think that people will judge for themselves,â€\\x9d said Ed Gillespie, one of the top advisers to Romney and one of the most seasoned Republican operatives in politics.
 But not even Gillespie, when he was asked by a reporter where he was going before he cut himself off, could resist getting some digs at Biden.
 â€œI don't know if his staff didn't brief him or not, but somebody should have told him that these debates are split-screen,â€\\x9d Gillespie said.
 â€œThere seemed to be some frustration on his part at times, and sometimes I got the impression that he couldn't defend the facts as they were, [so] raise your voice a little louder,â€\\x9d Gillespie said.
 The Obama campaign, of course, relished in Republicansâ€™ focus on Bidenâ€™s behavior instead of the substance of his remarks.
 "Their side is all spending their time talking about laughing and facial tics," said Obama campaign manager Jim Messina. "You're going to do that when you've lost a debate. And that's what happened tonight: they lost the debate."
 Of course, Biden was so demonstrative, so outsized, that it was hard to talk about anything else.
 Biden did another thing Obama did not a week ago. He raised the issue of Romneyâ€™s comments at a fundraiser in May in which he talked disparagingly about people who receive government benefits, claiming that he could â€œnever convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives."
 One of Ryanâ€™s best one-liners came when he sought to explain these comments.
 Ryan first told a humanizing story about Romney caring for a family whose children were in a car crash, a story clearly prepared to push back against the portrait of Romney as out of touch and uncaring. And he then added: â€œWith respect to that quote, I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way.â€\\x9d
 Although there were extended portions of the debate that focused on Libya, Syria, and Afghanistan, Biden and Ryan did engage in a lengthy back-and-forth in the middle of the debate on Medicare and tax policy.
 Ryan was, as usual, knowledgeable and in command of the facts. But Biden, as expected, attempted to plow him over with broadsides.
 â€œStop talking about how you care about people. Show me something. Show me a policy,â€\\x9d Biden said.
 Ryan smiled, and continued to work through a data-filled argument, mentioning the $831 billion stimulus, an 8 percent unemployment rate for 43 months, the 1.3 percent growth rate of the economy, the $90 billion for green energy programs in the stimulus, and the 12 million jobs he and Romney say their economic program would create.
 Biden didnâ€™t worry so much about numbers. Bidenâ€™s argument on Medicare was aimed at votersâ€™ guts, much more so than minds. He acknowledged that Romneyâ€™s Medicare plan would not cost seniors an extra $6,400 a year, despite the claim in a recently launched Obama campaign ad.
 The $6,400 figure is based on a study of one of Ryanâ€™s earlier plans for Medicare, which he has since changed to make it more bipartisan.
 Biden, aware of this, told voters they should be suspicious somebody â€œwho would actually put in motion a plan that â€¦ added $6,400 a year more to the cost of Medicare?â€\\x9d

TITLE: Ryan facing Catholic prof complaints over budget comments ahead of Georgetown speech

PUBLISHED: 2012/04/25

GOP Rep. Paul Ryan is heading to Georgetown University for a speech Thursday morning, but not before an old-fashioned, Catholic school knuckle-rapping.
 A group of nearly 90 professors and administrators connected to the Jesuit-founded school in Washington, D.C., has sent Ryan, R-Wis., a letter saying heâ€™s misused Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing, GOP House budget.
 â€œWe appreciate your willingness to talk about how Catholic social teaching can help inform effective policy in dealing with the urgent challenges facing our country,â€\\x9d the letter states. â€œHowever, we would be remiss â€¦ if we did not challenge your continuing misuse of Catholic teaching to defend a budget plan that decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few.â€\\x9d
 Ryan, since introducing the budget last month, has talked about the doctrine in several interviews including one a couple weeks ago on the Christian Broadcasting Network.
 In that interview, he invoked the Catholic teaching of "subsidiarity," saying it means "not having big government crowd out civic society, but ... having enough space in our communities so that we can interact with each other" and take care of people.
 "To me, the principle of subsidiarity, which is really federalism, meaning government closest to the people governs best," he said.
 The Georgetown University letter argues, though, that Ryan misappropriated the Catholic teaching as a â€œrationale for gutting government programs.â€\\x9d
 The writers acknowledge that the teaching indeed calls for local-level solutions to problems but say it is â€œnot a free pass to dismantle governmentâ€\\x9d and requires higher levels of government.
 The statement also quotes from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' letters to Congress saying budgets cannot rely on disproportionate cuts in essential services to the poor.
 Ryan, a Catholic and chairman of the House Budget Committee, said last week the letters do not express the views of all U.S. bishops, a point on which the conference disagrees.
 Georgetown's Public Policy Institute, which is hosting the upcoming Ryan lecture, said Wednesday the event is still scheduled for Thursday morning.
 "Chairman Ryan remains grateful for Georgetown's invitation to advance a thoughtful dialogue this week on his efforts to avert a looming debt crisis that would hurt the poor the first and the worst,â€\\x9d a Ryan spokesman said. â€œHe looks forward to affirming our shared commitment to a preferential option for the poor, which of course does not mean a preferential option for bigger government."
 Ryan, who was raised on Social Security benefits after his father died, also on Fox News defended his budget against the conference, saying for instance that the concept of denying tax credits to illegal immigrants is merely "following through on policy" that has had bipartisan support.

TITLE: Santorum: 'Phony theology' comment was about energy policy, not Christian faith

PUBLISHED: 2012/02/19

Rick Santorum said Sunday he wasn't questioning whether President Obama is a Christian when he referred to his "phony theology" over the weekend, but was in fact challenging policies that he says place the stewardship of the Earth above the welfare of people living on it.
 "I wasn't suggesting the president's not a Christian. I accept the fact that the president is a Christian," Santorum said.
 "I was talking about the radical environmentalist," he said. "I was talking about energy, this idea that man is here to serve the Earth as opposed to husband its resources and be good stewards of the Earth. And I think that is a phony ideal.
 "I don't believe that that's what we're here to do. That man is here to use the resources and use them wisely, to care for the Earth, to be a steward of the Earth, but we're not here to serve the Earth. The Earth is not the objective. Man is the objective. And I think a lot of radical environmentalists have it upside down," Santorum said.
 But the president's campaign, responding forcefully to the new frontrunner in the GOP race, said the remark is a personal affront.
 "I can't help but think that those remarks are well over the line. It's wrong. It's destructive," said Robert Gibbs, the president's former press secretary who is now working on Obama's reelection effort.
 "It's time to get rid of this. It's time to have a debate on our political positions, but not question each other's character and faith," he said.
 Obama campaign deputy press secretary Ben Labolt also issued a statement Saturday shortly after Santorum told voters that Obama's agenda is "not about you. It's not about your quality of life. It's not about your jobs. It's about some phony ideal. Some phony theology. Not a theology based on the Bible. A different theology."
 The comment was "the latest low in a Republican primary campaign that has been fueled by distortions, ugliness, and searing pessimism and negativity." It was "a stark contrast with the president who is focused everyday on creating jobs and restoring economic security for the middle class," LaBolt said.
 Santorum, who has pulled ahead of Mitt Romney in polling for the 2012 Republican presidential primary nod, said Sunday that when he used the word "theology" he was referring to a "world view that elevates the Earth above man."
 That world view, Santorum continued, suggests that man could harm the Earth by using the resources available even while relying on claims that "frankly are just not scientifically proven, for example, the politicization of the whole global warming debate."
 "I mean, this is just all an attempt to, you know, to centralize power and to give more power to the government," Santorum said.
 Santorum said he never questioned the president's faith and repeatedly said he believes Obama is a Christian.
 "He says he is a Christian. But I am talking about his world view or his -- the way he approaches problems in this country. And I think they're different than how most people do in America," he said.
 But while Gibbs said it's time to get off the "mindset that if we disagree, we have to disqualify each other" comments like Santorum's show that the GOP primary "has been a race to the bottom. We have seen nastiness, divisiveness, ugliness, distortions of opponents' records, of the president's record."
 Santorum appeared on CBS' "Face the Nation." Gibbs was on ABC's "This Week."

TITLE: Santorum Calls For Ending Public Education, Prenatal Testing

PUBLISHED: 2012/02/19

A more congenial Rick Santorum doubled down on several controversial, and religiously laden, remarks in an interview Sunday morning on CBS's "Face the Nation," where he defended his recent claims that prenatal testing results in abortions, that federally provided education was "anachronistic," and that President Obama's policies are not "based on the Bible."
 "I've repeatedly said I don't question the president's faith," Santorum told host Bob Schieffer, denying what some have said was a signal that Santorum had challenged the legitimacy of Obama's Christianity. "I've repeatedly said that I believe the president's Christian -- he says he's Christian. But I am talking about his worldview, the way he addresses problems in this country, and they're different than most people view it in America."
 In a speech to Tea Party conservatives on Saturday in Columbus, Ohio, Santorum had dismissed Obamaâ€™s politics as being based in â€œsome phony theology.â€\\x9d
 "It's not about you. It's not about your quality of life. It's not about your jobs," Santorum said. "It's about some phony ideal, some phony theology. Oh, not a theology based on the Bible. A different theology."
 An incredulous Bob Schieffer began his interview with Santorum Sunday by asking, "What in the world were you talking about?"
 "I was talking about the radical environmentalists," Santorum said, suggesting that they believe man should protect the earth, rather than "steward its resources." "I think that is a phony ideal. I don't believe that's what we're here to do ... We're not here to serve the earth. That is not the objective, man is the objective."
 Earlier in the day on Saturday, Santorum had also said that health insurance plans shouldnâ€™t be required to cover prenatal testing, because that testing results in more abortions, as well as contending that government-run public education was â€œanachronistic.â€\\x9d
 "Free prenatal testing ends up in more abortions and therefore less care that has to be done, because we cull the ranks of the disabled in our society," Santorum told the Ohio Christian Alliance conference.
 Asked by Schieffer about his claims that prenatal testing leads to more abortions, Santorum insisted that this was "a fact."
 "We're talking about specifically prenatal testing, and specifically amniocentesis, which is a procedure that actually creates a risk of having a miscarriage when you have it, and is done for the purposes of identifying maladies of a child in the womb. And in many cases -- and in fact in most cases -- most physicians recommend, if there is a problem, they recommend abortion," Santorum said.
 Santorum had said that because of this trend, health insurance providers should not be forced to make the procedures available free of charge.
 Santorum also told Schieffer that government-provided education was not working and that the process ought to be customizable, like buying a car.
 "I'm saying that local communities and parents should be the ones in control over public education, certainly not the federal government, and I think the state governments have not done a particularly good job in public education, either," Santorum said.
 Buying a car, by contrast he said, is "designed to meet the needs of a customer. Federally or state-run education is not designed to meet the needs of the customer."
 Speaking earlier on ABC's "This Week" about Santorum's remarks, Obama campaign aide Robert Gibbs called his rhetoric "well over the line."
 "I think it's time in our politics that we get rid of this mindset that if we disagree, we have to disqualify each other," Gibbs said.
 "I think if you make comments like that, you make comments that are well over the line," he added. "I think the GOP race has been, in many cases, a race to the bottom."

TITLE: White House Releases Benghazi Emails

PUBLISHED: 2013/05/15

WASHINGTON â€“- The White House on Wednesday released the full set of emails surrounding the Obama administrationâ€™s development of talking points describing the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, in response to continuing charges from congressional Republicans that there was a massive political â€œcover-upâ€\\x9d of what transpired there. Nothing in the emails supports theories that the talking points were changed in order to influence the 2012 election.
 In a briefing with reporters at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, senior administration officials used the 100 pages of emails to show that a number of government agencies, not just the State Department, drove many of the changes to the talking points that were ultimately used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice.
 The cache of emails paint a fuller picture than did an email leaked earlier this week, which portrayed a State Department concerned about its public image.
 Republican lawmakers have argued that the State Department and the White House were attempting to alter the talking points for political reasons and ignored suggestions and language put forward by the CIA. In particular, they pointed to the fact that references to al Qaeda and previous security warnings were removed. But senior administration officials stressed on Wednesday that such language in fact was taken out at the request of the CIA.
 Critics have said the role of State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland in revising the talking points in particular shows an administration trying to protect its reputation as being tough on terrorism. They have criticized Nuland for requesting to remove a line from the final draft noting that there had been "at least five other attacks against foreign interests in Benghazi by unidentified assailants."
 Nuland said in a Sept. 14 email that she didn't want that information included because it "could be abused by members [of Congress] to beat up the State Department for not paying attention to warnings, so why would we want to feed that either? Concerned ..."
 But senior administration officials on Wednesday said that Michael J. Morell, then the deputy director of the CIA, also wanted that line removed, separately from Nuland. Morell believed it was irrelevant to the message of the talking points -- what happened in Benghazi -- and unprofessional to include those warnings but not allow State Department officials to include how they had responded to them.
 Separate from Wednesday's document release, the CIA recently conducted an internal review of how and why the talking points were changed -- a move that also came in response to the continuing questions from Congress. That review showed that many changes were made to the original talking points -- drafted by a senior officer -- over concerns about accuracy, an FBI investigation and other bureaucratic matters. A U.S. intelligence official told The Huffington Post the review was completed "early this year."
 Senior administration officials, discussing that internal review, relayed that some CIA officials didn't like that the original draft of the talking points said the government "know[s] that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qa'ida participated in the attack," because at that time it was premature to name those responsible for the attacks.
 Their concerns at other times were more mundane. For example, CIA officials also decided to change the phrase "attacks in Benghazi ... evolved into a direct assault against the US Consulate" to "demonstrations in Benghazi" because they believed "attacks" and "assault" were synonymous, making the phrase illogical.
 CIA officers also removed the reference to al Qaeda in order to avoid prejudging the outcome of a FBI investigation into the incident. A reference to another terrorist group, Ansar al-Sharia, was left in, but later removed at the request of the State Department; the CIA agreed with that decision, again so as not to hinder the FBI investigation.
 The timing of the White House's document release raises its own set of questions. Why, for example, did the administration choose to make the emails public now, after months of enduring criticism and requests for more information? If the material was too sensitive to share publicly months, weeks or days ago, what changed on Wednesday?
 While the document dump does soften some of the more critical theories that have arisen with respect to the White House's handling of the events in Benghazi, it could also embolden critics who now see an administration willing to accommodate demands for documents.
 In a response shortly after the emails were made public on Wednesday, Brendan Buck, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), said just that.
 "The House interim report found that 'senior State Department officials requested the talking points be changed to avoid criticism for ignoring the threat environment in Benghazi' and that those changes were ultimately made," said Buck. "Those findings are confirmed by the emails released today, and they contradict statements made by the White House that it and the State Department only changed one word in the talking points. The seemingly political nature of the State Departmentâ€™s concerns raises questions about the motivations behind these changes and who at the State Department was seeking them."
 UPDATE: 9 p.m. -- White House spokesman Eric Schultz said he hoped Wednesday's disclosure would put to rest the Benghazi issue.
 â€œDespite the fact that e-mails relating to the Benghazi talking points were made available to members of Congress several months ago, in recent days these e-mails have been selectively and inaccurately read out to the media. To make clear what is and is not in these e-mails, today the White House took the extraordinary step of releasing these e-mails," Schultz said. "You can now see what the Congress has seen -- collectively these emails make clear that the interagency process, including the White House's interactions, were focused on providing the facts as we knew them based on the best information available at the time and protecting an ongoing investigation. After 11 hearings, 25,000 pages of documents, and now this release, we can hopefully spend our time working on whatâ€™s important â€“ what we can do together to ensure those serving their nation overseas are better protected than they were last September.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Jackson pleads guilty over illegal campaign spending spree

PUBLISHED: 2013/02/20

Former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. pleaded guilty Wednesday in federal court to charges that he spent $750,000 in campaign cash on personal items.
 The Illinois Democrat faces up to five years in prison, but guidelines recommend slightly less. Sentencing has been set for June 28.
 â€œI truly understand the consequences of my actions and of the preceding,â€\\x9d Jackson said through tears. â€œI did these things. â€¦ I used money that should have been used for my campaign.â€\\x9d
 Federal prosecutors say Jackson, who resigned from Congress in November amid the investigation and health issues, used campaign money to buy items including a $43,350 gold-plated men's Rolex watch and $9,587.64 worth of children's furniture.
 He and his wife, Sandra, had agreed to plead guilty in deals with federal prosecutors. Jackson's guilty plea was to a conspiracy charge.
 His wife later pleaded guilty Wednesday to a charge of filing false joint federal income tax returns for the years 2006 through 2011 that knowingly understated the income the couple received.
 Jackson told the judge that he had been hospitalized for psychological issues. The whole hearing lasted about 50 minutes.
 "Not a proud day," he said. "I'm sorry I let everybody down."
 The Jacksons were appearing separately before U.S. District Judge Robert L. Wilkins in Washington, D.C. Jackson's wife spent $5,150 on fur capes and parkas, court documents said.
 When prosecutors charged the couple last Friday, the ex-congressman said he fully accepts the responsibility for the improper decisions and mistakes he has made. Tom Kirsch, an attorney for Jackson's wife, said she has signed a plea agreement with federal prosecutors and would plead guilty to one tax count.
 The conspiracy charge against the former congressman carries a maximum statutory penalty of up to five years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, and other penalties.
 The charge against Sandra Jackson carries a maximum of three years in prison. However, one of her lawyers, Tom Kirsch, says the plea agreement "does not contemplate a sentence of that length." Sandra Jackson was a Chicago alderman before she resigned last month during the federal investigation.
 In court papers filed against Jackson on Friday, prosecutors said that upon conviction he must forfeit $750,000, plus tens of thousands of dollars' worth of memorabilia items and furs. The memorabilia includes a football signed by U.S. presidents, a Michael Jackson fedora, and memorabilia of Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Jimi Hendrix and Bruce Lee -- all from a company called Antiquities of Nevada.
 As the hearing for Jackson got under way Wednesday, newly filed court papers disclosed that the judge had offered to disqualify himself from handling the cases against Jackson and his wife.
 As a Harvard Law School student, Wilkins said he had supported the presidential campaign of Jackson's father, civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, and that as an attorney in 1999, Wilkins had been a guest on a show hosted by Jackson's father.
 In the newly filed court papers, prosecutors and lawyers for both Jesse Jackson Jr. and Sandra Jackson said they were willing to proceed with the cases with Wilkins presiding. Judicial ethics require that a judge disqualify himself if his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.

TITLE: Mary Cheney Criticizes Her Sister on Same-Sex Marriage

PUBLISHED: 2013/08/31

Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, sharply criticized her sisterâ€™s stance on same-sex marriage and urged her own Facebook friends to share the message.
 Posting on Facebook on Friday evening, Mary Cheney, who is gay and married her longtime partner last year, wrote: â€œFor the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage.â€\\x9d
 Their father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, supports same-sex marriage, and the younger Cheney echoed some of his language on the issue when she added, â€œFreedom means freedom for everyone.â€\\x9d
 â€œThat means that all families â€” regardless of how they look or how they are made â€” all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other,â€\\x9d Mary Cheney wrote.
 Earlier Friday, Liz Cheney revealed her position on same-sex marriage, a topic she has kept relatively quiet about since declaring her candidacy in July against incumbent Senator Mike Enzi, Republican of Wyoming.
 â€œI am not pro-gay marriage,â€\\x9d Liz Cheney said in a statement responding to an apparent push poll against her in Wyoming. â€œI believe the issue of marriage must be decided by the states, and by the people in the states, not by judges and not even by legislators, but by the people themselves.â€\\x9d
 That position â€” deferring to the will of the voters on a state-by-state basis â€” may represent something of a compromise between total support or opposition. But it did little to placate her sister.
 â€œItâ€™s not something to be decided by a show of hands,â€\\x9d Mary Cheney wrote.
 And to emphasize that she was not shying away from drawing attention to her view, Mary Cheney concluded her Facebook post: â€œPlease like and share if you agree.â€\\x9d
 In an e-mail, Mary Cheney declined to comment further on her sisterâ€™s position, saying she would let her Facebook post speak for itself.
 The Cheney family dispute mirrors the broader disagreement among Republicans on same-sex marriage. Less than a decade after George W. Bush and Dick Cheney won re-election in part thanks to conservative enthusiasm over enshrining traditional marriage into law, some in the party believe they are losing voters, particularly younger ones, over an issue on which public opinion has changed rapidly. But other Republicans believe traditional marriage is a pillar of family values, and in some cases are reluctant to abandon their social conservative base on the issue.
 Liz Cheneyâ€™s stance underlines the degree to which full-throated support for same-sex marriage, even in a libertarian-leaning state like Wyoming, still poses a political risk in a Republican primary.
 Mr. Enzi opposes legalizing same-sex marriage.

 WASHINGTON â€” In one of her final appearances as secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday vigorously defended her handling of last Septemberâ€™s attack on the United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans and prompted a scathing review of State Department procedures.
 â€œAs I have said many times, I take responsibility, and nobody is more committed to getting this right,â€\\x9d she said, reading a statement during a day of testimony before Senate and House committees. â€œI am determined to leave the State Department and our country safer, stronger and more secure.â€\\x9d
 But Mrs. Clinton, whose appearance before Congress had been postponed since December because of illness, quickly departed from the script. She jousted with Republican lawmakers over who deserved blame for the security problems at the compound, and choked up as she described being at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington when the bodies of the Americans killed in the assault arrived from Libya.
 â€œI stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews,â€\\x9d she said. â€œI put my arms around the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters.â€\\x9d
 The continuing controversy over the attack, which resulted in the deaths of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, has cast a cloud over Mrs. Clintonâ€™s final months at the State Department. It also has enormous political implications for Mrs. Clinton, the former New York senator who is already regarded as the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination if she chooses to run. It was the first time she had faced extensive questioning about her role in the episode.
 In essence, Mrs. Clintonâ€™s approach was to accept the responsibility for security lapses in Benghazi but not the blame.
 â€œI feel responsible for the nearly 70,000 people who work for the State Department,â€\\x9d Mrs. Clinton told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the morning. â€œBut the specific security requests pertaining to Benghazi, you know, were handled by the security professionals in the department. I didnâ€™t see those requests. They didnâ€™t come to me. I didnâ€™t approve them. I didnâ€™t deny them.â€\\x9d
 When the question of her role was taken up again in the afternoon hearing by Representative Ed Royce, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that she had been briefed on a series of events that indicated that security in Benghazi was deteriorating in the months before the attack. They included the placement of a bomb at the outer wall of the compound in June and an ambush that month on the British ambassador.
 But she said she had gone along with a recommendation from subordinates that the Benghazi post be kept open and assumed that they would take the necessary steps to protect it.
 Mrs. Clinton first publicly took responsibility for the Sept. 11 attack in an Oct. 15 interview with television reporters. Since then, she has committed herself to putting in place all of the recommendations of an independent review that was led by Thomas R. Pickering, a former American ambassador, and Mike Mullen, the retired admiral who served as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
 For all of the hours of testimony, the hearings did little to clarify the role of the White House in overseeing the American presence in Libya before the attack or explain why the Pentagon had few forces available on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to respond quickly to any assault on diplomatic outposts in the region.
 One of the sharpest exchanges of the day came when Mrs. Clinton responded to questions from Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, by saying there was too much focus on how the Benghazi attack had been characterized in its early hours and not enough on how to prevent a recurrence. Republicans have repeatedly charged that Obama administration officials deliberately played down the attack, focusing much of their criticism on Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations and once Mr. Obamaâ€™s choice to succeed Mrs. Clinton.
 â€œWas it because of a protest, or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided theyâ€™d go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make?â€\\x9d Mrs. Clinton said, her voice rising. â€œIt is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.â€\\x9d
 Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, began his questions by saying, â€œItâ€™s wonderful to see you in good health and as combative as ever,â€\\x9d and then proceeded to complain that she had failed to answer lingering questions.
 Mr. McCain asserted that the Obama administrationâ€™s aversion to nation-building had precluded it from providing the kind of training and assistance that would have helped the fledgling Libyan government in Tripoli confront growing security threats from militants.
 â€œWe did not give them the kind of assistance that would have been necessary to help dismantle these militias that still, to this day, remain a challenge to democracy in Libya,â€\\x9d he said.
 Mrs. Clinton responded that Congress had delayed aid to Libya and said she would provide a list of steps that had been taken to train and equip Libyan forces.
 A persistent line of questioning by Republican lawmakers concerned the initial comments from Ms. Rice that the attack might have resulted from a protest, over an anti-Islamic video, that spun out of control.
 Mrs. Clinton defended Ms. Rice even as she appeared to distance herself from Ms. Riceâ€™s comments. â€œI told the American people that heavily armed militants assaulted our compound, and I vowed to bring them to justice,â€\\x9d Mrs. Clinton said.
 The Senate Foreign Relations Committeeâ€™s chairman, Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, has been nominated to succeed Mrs. Clinton and is scheduled to appear before his committee on Thursday for a confirmation hearing. To avoid the perception of a conflict of interest, the hearing on Wednesday was led by Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, the incoming chairman, and Mr. Kerry did not attend.
 In a rare criticism of the committee by one of its members, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the ranking Republican, complained that the panel Mr. Kerry led had failed to conduct proper oversight of security and other State Department issues.
 â€œThis is an opportunity for this committee to finally do the work that it should have been doing for years,â€\\x9d Mr. Corker said.
 Mrs. Clinton sought to put the events in Benghazi in a regional context, noting the presence of a group in northern Mali affiliated with Al Qaeda.
 â€œBenghazi didnâ€™t happen in a vacuum,â€\\x9d she said. â€œThe Arab revolutions have scrambled power dynamics and shattered security forces across the region. And instability in Mali has created an expanding safe haven for terrorists who look to extend their influence and plot further attacks of the kind we saw just last week in Algeria.â€\\x9d
 â€œWe are in for a struggle, but it is a necessary struggle,â€\\x9d she said. â€œWe cannot permit northern Mali to become a safe haven.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Obama administration defends 2nd mass surveillance project

PUBLISHED: 2013/06/07

The Obama administration found itself defending -- and beginning to explain -- yet another surveillance effort after leaked documents revealed information about two secret National Security Agency intelligence-gathering programs.
 On top of a Guardian newspaper report that revealed how authorities were collecting phone records from millions, a Washington Post report detailed another program that scours major Internet companies including Google and Facebook for data. A former senior NSA official confirmed to Fox News that the program was started in 2007 by the FBI and NSA and allows them to tap into top U.S. Internet companies to pull audio, video and other data.
 While civil liberties groups cried foul over the program, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper issued a statement late Thursday decrying the leak of the materials. He called the disclosure of the program that allows the NSA to collect communications data from Internet companies "reprehensible" and said the phone-records monitoring leak could cause harm to the nation's intelligence gathering activities.
 At the same time, he took the rare step of moving to declassify information about the programs as he sought to defend them against criticism.
 â€œThe article omits key information regarding how a classified intelligence collection program is used to prevent terrorist attacks and the numerous safeguards that protect privacy and civil liberties," he said of the Guardian story.
 Clapper also said the government was "prohibited from indiscriminately sifting through the telephony metadata acquired under the program.â€\\x9d All information acquired, he said, â€œis subject to strict, court-imposed restrictions on review and handling. The court only allows the data to be queried when there is a reasonable suspicion, based on specific facts, that the particular basis for the query is associated with a foreign terrorist organization.â€œ
 Several hours earlier, a senior administration official also pushed back, saying the Guardian article and Washington Post article about the Internet mining refers to collection under a law that "does not allow the targeting of any U.S. citizen or of any person located within the United States.â€\\x9d
 It was not immediately clear how the official defined â€œtargeting.â€\\x9d
 â€œThe program is subject to oversight by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the Executive Branch, and Congress,â€\\x9d the official said. â€œIt involves extensive procedures, specifically approved by the court, to ensure that only non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. are targeted, and that minimize the acquisition, retention and dissemination of incidentally acquired information about U.S. persons.â€\\x9d
 A former NSA official told Fox News the FBI and National Security Agency (NSA) have been tapping into leading U.S. Internet companies to pull audio, video and photographs.
 According to the official, the program began in 2007 and is in the second phase. Metadata from the companies is used to identify suspicious individuals and the secondary search goes into content. The official told Fox News that the Utah Data Center is likely a repository for this material.
 The classified program is code-named PRISM, the Washington Post reported, and has not been disclosed publicly before. Members of Congress who are aware of the program were reportedly bound by oath to keep it confidential.
 According to slides from an internal presentation intended for NSA senior analysts and obtained by the Washington Post, the program accounts for nearly one in seven intelligence reports.
 The companies that participate knowingly in the program are Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube and Apple, the Washington Post reports.
 A number of the Internet companies issued statements Thursday night saying they only complied when legally bound to do so.
 "Even when the system works just as advertised, with no American singled out for targeting, the NSA routinely collects a great deal of American content," the Washington Post report said. "That is described as "incidental," and it is inherent in contact chaining, one of the basic tools of the trade."
 To be immune from lawsuits, companies like Yahoo and AOL are reportedly obliged to accept a directive from the attorney general and national intelligence director to open their service to the FBI's Data Intercept Technology Unit, which acts as a liaison between the companies and the NSA.
 According to the slides, there has been â€œcontinued exponential growth in tasking to Facebook and Skype."
 "With a few clicks and an affirmation that the subject is believed to be engaged in terrorism, espionage or nuclear proliferation, an analyst obtains full access to Facebookâ€™s 'extensive search and surveillance capabilities against the variety of online social networking services,'" the Washington Post reports.
 Skype can reportedly be monitored for audio when one end of a call is a conventional telephone and also can be monitored for video, chat and file transfers when users connect just by a computer. Google services that can be monitored include Gmail, voice and video chat, Google Drive files, and search terms.
 A spokesperson for Google says the company "cares deeply" about the security of users' data.
 "We disclose user data to government in accordance with the law, and we review all such requests carefully," the spokesperson said. "From time to time, people allege that we have created a government 'back door' into our systems, but Google does not have a 'back door' for the government to access private user data."
 "Protecting the privacy of our users and their data is a top priority for Facebook," the company's chief security officer Joe Sullivan said in a statement. "We do not provide any government organization with direct access to Facebook servers. When Facebook is asked for data or information about specific individuals, we carefully scrutinize any such request for compliance with all applicable laws, and provide information only to the extent required by law."
 A Microsoft spokesperson said that the company only provides customer data after receiving a legally binding order or subpoena.
 "In addition we only ever comply with orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers," the spokesperson said. "If the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data we don't participate in it."

TITLE: Mary Cheney: Sister Is 'Dead Wrong' On Gay Marriage

PUBLISHED: 2013/09/01

Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Wyoming U.S Senate candidate Liz Cheney (R) and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, criticized her sister's opposition to same-sex marriage in a Friday Facebook post, the New York Times reports.
 According to the Times, Mary Cheney, who is openly gay and married her partner, Heather Poe, in Washington, DC last year, took to Facebook to rebuke her sister's remarks.
 â€œFor the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage," she wrote.
 "Freedom means freedom for everyone," she continued. "That means that all families â€” regardless of how they look or how they are made â€” all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other."
 On Friday, Liz Cheney issued a statement voicing her opposition to same-sex marriage.
 "I am strongly pro-life and I am not pro-gay marriage," she said. â€œI believe the issue of marriage must be decided by the states, and by the people in the states, not by judges and not even by legislators, but by the people themselves."
 The elder Cheney daughter is challenging Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) in next year's Republican primary. Previously, she had spoken out against the military's former "don't ask, don't tell" policy.
 According to The Hill, Cheney sought to clarify her position after an alleged poll in Wyoming said she "supports abortion and aggressively promotes gay marriage."
 Her opposition also puts her at odds with her father, who offered support for gay marriage in 2009.
 "I think that freedom means freedom for everyone," the former vice president said. "As many of you know, one of my daughters is gay and it is something we have lived with for a long time in our family. I think people ought to be free to enter into any kind of union they wish."

TITLE: Obama Poised to Back Comprehensive Plan to Curb Gun Violence

PUBLISHED: 2013/01/14

Obama Willing to Use Executive Orders on Guns
 WASHINGTON â€” President Obama this week will embrace a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence that will call for major legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases and lay out 19 separate actions the president could take by invoking the power of his office, lawmakers who were briefed on the plan said Monday.
 Lawmakers and other officials said that the president could use a public event as soon as Wednesday to signal his intention to engage in the biggest Congressional fight over guns in nearly two decades, focusing on the heightened background checks and including efforts to ban assault weapons and their high-capacity clips. But given the difficulty of pushing new rules through a bitterly divided Congress, Mr. Obama will also promise to act on his own to reduce gun violence wherever possible.
 Actions the president could take on his own are likely to include imposing new limits on guns imported from overseas, compelling federal agencies to improve sharing of mental health records and directing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct research on gun violence, according to those briefed on the effort.
 White House aides believe Mr. Obama can also ratchet up enforcement of existing laws, including tougher prosecution of people who lie on their background checks.
 At a news conference on Monday, exactly one month after the school massacre in Newtown, Conn., Mr. Obama said a task force led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had â€œpresented me now with a list of sensible, common-sense steps that can be taken to make sure that the kinds of violence we saw at Newtown doesnâ€™t happen again. He added: â€œMy starting point is not to worry about the politics. My starting point is to focus on what makes sense, what works.â€\\x9d
 The administrationâ€™s strategy reflects the uncertainty of gun politics in America and the desire by White House officials to address the Connecticut shooting while also confronting the broader deficiencies in the countryâ€™s criminal justice and mental health systems.
 By proposing to use the independent power of his office, Mr. Obama is inviting political attacks by gun owners who have already expressed fear that he will abuse that authority to restrict their rights. Representative Steve Stockman, Republican of Texas, threatened Monday to file articles of impeachment if the president seeks to regulate guns with executive orders. â€œI will seek to thwart this action by any means necessary,â€\\x9d Mr. Stockman said in a statement.
 White House officials and Democratic lawmakers said that there are clear limits to what the president can and cannot do, and that Mr. Obama has no plans to push beyond what he would need Congressional authority to accomplish.
 On Capitol Hill, Mr. Obamaâ€™s legislative effort will face intense opposition from gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association, and the lawmakers they support with millions of dollars at election time and who see gun rights as a defining issue in their districts. But Mr. Obamaâ€™s allies see a rare opening for tighter gun rules after Congress has shied away from the politically charged issue for years.
 â€œHeâ€™s putting together a pretty comprehensive list of what could be done to make a difference in this area,â€\\x9d said Representative Mike Thompson of California, who is heading a Democratic task force in the House. â€œThereâ€™s some huge, huge holes in the process that are set up to keep communities safe. We need to close those holes.â€\\x9d
 Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, said Vice President Biden had informed lawmakers during a two-hour briefing on Monday that there are â€œ19 independent steps that the president can take by executive order.â€\\x9d Ms. Speier said the executive action is part of the â€œmost comprehensive gun safety effort in a generation.â€\\x9d
 Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago and Mr. Obamaâ€™s former chief of staff, joined the debate on Monday and said that the president should â€œclear the tableâ€\\x9d by doing whatever he can administratively so small issues do not get in the way of the bigger legislative fights over access to guns.
 â€œDonâ€™t allow a side issue to derail these things,â€\\x9d Mr. Emanuel said during a discussion about gun policy. While many gun control advocates are eager to harness what they believe is a ripe moment in American life for new and robust restrictions on the kinds of guns that were used in Newtown, there is an emerging consensus on Capitol Hill and among gun education groups that improving the system of background check legislation that currently exempts private gun sales and gun shows is the most viable legislative route to pursue.
 â€œThe assault-weapons ban is a low priority relative to the other measures the Biden task force is considering,â€\\x9d Matt Bennett, a spokesman for Third Way, a left-leaning research group, said after hearing from Mr. Biden last week. â€œPolitical capital in the gun debate only goes so far. We think it should be spent on things that would have the greatest impact on gun violence, like universal background checks and cracking down on gun trafficking.â€\\x9d
 Any efforts to get gun legislation through Congress will require an enormous and ceaseless pressure campaign by the administration. Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden are likely to keep up the pressure on lawmakers with public events in the weeks and months ahead, according to those familiar with the White House strategy.
 Scores of senators, including many Democrats, will be wary of voting on any effort to curb access to guns or ammunition. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, is a longtime supporter of gun rights. Still, gun legislation is likely to begin in the Senate because the House is controlled by Republicans, many of whom oppose new restrictions on guns.
 With fiscal issues continuing to dominate the political calendar for the next several weeks, White House officials and lawmakers say the gun safety effort is likely to be debated in separate pieces of legislation that could be introduced over time. In coming weeks, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, will reintroduce a measure that would require every gun buyer, with limited exceptions, to undergo a background check and would force states to feed all relevant data into the background check system so those with criminal convictions and the mentally ill could be flagged.

TITLE: E-Mails Show Jostling Over Benghazi â€˜Talking Pointsâ€™

PUBLISHED: 2013/05/15

WASHINGTON â€” E-mails released by the White House on Wednesday revealed a fierce internal jostling over the governmentâ€™s official talking points in the aftermath of last Septemberâ€™s attack in Benghazi, Libya, not only between the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency, but at the highest levels of the C.I.A.
 The 100 pages of e-mails showed a disagreement between David H. Petraeus, then the director of the C.I.A., and his deputy, Michael J. Morell, over how much to disclose in the talking points, which were used by Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations, in television appearances days after the attack.
 Mr. Morell, administration officials said, deleted a reference in the draft version of the talking points to C.I.A. warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials objected to because they feared it would reflect badly on them.
 Mr. Morell, officials said, acted on his own and not in response to pressure from the State Department. But when the final draft of the talking points was sent to Mr. Petraeus, he dismissed them, saying â€œFrankly, Iâ€™d just as soon not use this,â€\\x9d adding that the heavily scrubbed account would not satisfy the House Democrat who had requested it.
 â€œThis is certainly not what Vice Chairman Ruppersberger was hoping to get,â€\\x9d Mr. Petraeus wrote, referring to Representative C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which had asked Mr. Petraeus for talking points to use with reporters in discussing the attack on Benghazi.
 The White House released the e-mails to reporters after Republicans seized on snippets of the correspondence that became public on Friday to suggest that President Obamaâ€™s national security staff had been complicit in trying to alter the talking points for political reasons.
 While the e-mails portrayed White House officials as being sensitive to the concerns of the State Department, they suggest that Mr. Obamaâ€™s aides mostly mediated a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and the C.I.A. over how much to disclose â€” all under heavy time constraints because of the demands from Capitol Hill. The e-mails revealed no new details about the administrationâ€™s evolving account of the Sept. 11 attack, which killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.
 â€œIn recent days, these e-mails have been selectively and inaccurately read out to the media,â€\\x9d said a White House spokesman, Eric Schultz. By releasing them, he said, the White House had shown that the drafting process was â€œfocused on providing the facts as we knew them, based on the best information available at the time and protecting an ongoing investigation.â€\\x9d
 Still, the final version of the talking points is stripped of material â€” including a reference to Libya being awash with weapons and fighters that made it a dangerous environment â€” which critics say would have raised questions about the State Departmentâ€™s security posture.
 Republicans welcomed the release of the e-mails, saying they confirmed that the administration had airbrushed its account of the attack during an election campaign. They also said the e-mails belied the White Houseâ€™s insistence that it had changed only one word in the talking points.
 â€œThe seemingly political nature of the State Departmentâ€™s concerns raises questions about the motivations behind these changes and who at the State Department was seeking them,â€\\x9d said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner.
 In releasing the e-mails, the White House was hoping to show that intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the debate over the talking points. It drew attention to a draft of the talking points â€” the only document provided by the White House that was not part of an e-mail chain â€” in which Mr. Morell, in his own writing, crossed out five lines that referred to C.I.A. warnings about the threat of attacks by Al Qaeda-linked extremists in Benghazi and eastern Libya.
 But there is no other evidence in the e-mails that Mr. Morell himself objected to the inclusion of this material. In an e-mail to Mr. Petraeus accompanying the final version of the talking points, Mr. Morell referred to the State Departmentâ€™s deep concerns about the references.
 The release of the e-mails offers a rare glimpse inside the White House five days after the attack as it struggled to piece together intelligence to formulate a public account of what happened.
 The process began in earnest at 4:20 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 14, when Stephen W. Preston, the C.I.A. general counsel, sent an e-mail to other agency officials warning them not to disclose information that might interfere with the F.B.I.â€™s investigation.
 At 6:20 p.m., the spokesman for the National Security Council at the time, Tommy Vietor, e-mailed to remind officials that Denis McDonough, then the deputy national security adviser and now the White House chief of staff, wanted to ensure that the edits were coordinated with the State Department.
 At 6:41 p.m., Shawn Turner, the spokesman for the director of national intelligence, suggested saying that on Sept. 10, the C.I.A. had â€œnotifiedâ€\\x9d the American embassy in Cairo, not â€œwarnedâ€\\x9d it, of social media reports calling for a demonstration and encouraging jihadists to break into the embassy. Mr. Morell later removed the entire reference.
 At 7:16 p.m., Victoria Nuland, the State Department spokeswoman, weighed in with her initial concerns about ensuring that the talking points provided to lawmakers did not go further than what the administration was telling reporters.
 Twenty-three minutes later, Ms. Nuland sent White House and intelligence officials an even more pointed e-mail, objecting that the talking points could be â€œabusedâ€\\x9d by lawmakers â€œto beat the State Department for not paying attention to agency warnings so why do we want to feed that either? Concerned ... â€\\x9d
 At 7:51 p.m., the F.B.I. offered only minor changes to the draft, the bureauâ€™s only suggestions during the contentious process.
 At 9:24 p.m., Ms. Nuland, reading the latest draft, complained in an e-mail, â€œThese donâ€™t resolve all my issues or those of my building leadership.â€\\x9d Ten minutes later, Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, offered his first comments, saying, â€œWe need to resolve this in a way that respects all of the relevant equities, especially the investigation.â€\\x9d
 In a report that set off the latest tempest over the talking points, ABC News reported incorrectly that Mr. Rhodes had emphasized the need to protect the State Departmentâ€™s interests.
 At 9:52 p.m., a C.I.A. spokesman e-mailed to other agency staff members a draft note intended for Mr. Petraeus, warning him that while the White House had quickly cleared the proposed talking points, the State Department had â€œmajor concerns.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Obamaâ€™s national security deputies reviewed the talking points at a meeting the next day, Sept. 15, Mr. Rhodes said.
 At 11:25 a.m., Mr. Rhodes changed a reference to the United States â€œconsulateâ€\\x9d in Benghazi to â€œdiplomatic post.â€\\x9d
 Over the next couple of hours, aides made small final changes and e-mailed a final version to lawmakers shortly after 3 p.m.
 With time short before Ms. Rice began taping her appearances on Sunday morning news programs, the White House also supplied her aides with the final talking points.
 Asked by one of Ms. Riceâ€™s aides, â€œIs this the final language you want to use on Benghazi,â€\\x9d Mr. Rhodes replied with a single word: â€œYup.â€\\x9d

TITLE: White House Plays Down Data Program

PUBLISHED: 2013/06/08

WASHINGTON â€” The Obama administration tried Saturday to marshal new evidence in defense of its collection of private Internet and telephone data, arguing that a secret program called Prism is simply an â€œinternal government computer systemâ€\\x9d designed to sort through court-supervised collection of data, and that Congress has been briefed 13 times on the programs since 2009.
 After rushing to declassify some carefully selected descriptions of the programs, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, conceded for the first time that the Prism program existed. But in a statement, after denouncing the leak of the data to The Guardian and The Washington Post, Mr. Clapper insisted it was â€œnot an undisclosed collection or data mining program.â€\\x9d Instead, he said it was a computer system to â€œfacilitateâ€\\x9d the collection of foreign intelligence that had been authorized by Congress.
 Mr. Clapper also insisted that the government â€œdoes not unilaterally obtain information from the serversâ€\\x9d of telephone and Internet providers, saying that information is turned over only under court order, when there is a â€œdocumented, foreign intelligence purpose for acquisitionâ€\\x9d of the data.
 He appeared to be attempting to push back against early reports that the government had direct access to the huge computer servers at Google, Microsoft, Facebook and similar companies. Those firms have denied they give the government a â€œback doorâ€\\x9d to their systems.
 But they acknowledge handing over material when ordered to do so by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, though they have not described the mechanism for complying with those orders. It appears the companies use some kind of electronic drop box, in which they place the material, so that the government can then harvest the information.
 The national intelligence directorâ€™s rare Saturday statement was notable for what it omitted: any description of other means the government may use to intercept Internet information directly from fiber optic cables or satellite systems even before or after it reaches those Internet companies.
 A new report in The Guardian, published online on Saturday, cited another document that showed that in March 2013 there were 97 billion pieces of data collected from networks worldwide; about 14 percent of it was from Iran, much was from Pakistan and about 3 percent came from inside the United States, though some of that may have been foreign data traffic routed through American-based servers.
 Meanwhile, senior Obama administration officials, including the directors of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and of national intelligence, have held 13 classified hearings and briefings for members of Congress since 2009 to explain the broad authority they say they have to sweep up electronic records for national security purposes, a senior administration official said Saturday.
 The administration, by disclosing the briefings, sought to push back on claims by Democrats and Republicans in Congress that they were either not aware of programs to mine vast amounts of Internet data and business telephone records or were insufficiently briefed on the details.
 Lawmakers said that what they knew was vague and broad â€” and that strict rules of classification prevented them from truly debating the programs or conducting proper oversight.
 In separate but identical letters sent on Oct. 19, 2011, Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich told two of Congressâ€™s most outspoken critics of the efforts, Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado, both Democrats, that in December 2009 and February 2011 the Justice Department and intelligence agencies provided a classified document to Congress describing the surveillance efforts in detail.
 The letter said the House and Senate Intelligence Committees had been briefed â€œon these operations multiple times and have had access to copies of the classifiedâ€\\x9d orders and opinions of the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Members of the committee were invited to share the information with other lawmakers.
 Broader briefings were held in 2011 before the reauthorization of the Patriot Act, the post-Sept. 11 law that authorized much of the surveillance.
 â€œAgainst this backdrop, we do not believe the executive branch is operating pursuant to â€˜secret lawâ€™ or â€˜secret opinions of the Department of Justice,â€™ â€\\x9d Mr. Weich wrote. â€œRather, the intelligence community is conducting court-authorized intelligence activities pursuant to a public statute, with the knowledge and oversight of Congress and the Intelligence Committees of both houses.â€\\x9d
 On Friday, Mr. Udall and Mr. Wyden released a joint statement repeating that they had â€œlong been concerned about the degree to which this collection has relied on â€˜secret law.â€™ â€\\x9d
 â€œSenior administration officials have stated on multiple occasions that the Patriot Actâ€™s â€˜business recordsâ€™ authority is â€˜analogous to a grand jury subpoena,â€™ â€\\x9d they said. They added that â€œmultiple senior officials have stated that U.S. intelligence agencies do not collect information or dossiers on â€˜millions of Americans,â€™ â€\\x9d assertions that they believe have been contradicted by revelations of Internet data mining and a court order asking a Verizon subsidiary to turn over logs of telephone calls.
 â€œNow that the fact of bulk collection has been declassified, we believe that more information about the scale of the collection, and specifically whether it involves the records of â€˜millions of Americans,â€™ should be declassified as well,â€\\x9d they said.
 The list of briefings begins on May 12, 2009, with a classified hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee involving Gen. Keith B. Alexander, the head of the United States Cyber Command, and David S. Kris, assistant attorney general for national security.
 On Feb. 14, 2011, all senators were offered the opportunity to discuss the broad authority under the Patriot Act with the director of national intelligence, Mr. Clapper; the F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III; and General Alexander. Mr. Mueller spoke to the House Republican Conference on May 13, 2011, and to the House Democratic Caucus on May 24, 2011.
 On Feb. 8, 2011, Senators Dianne Feinstein of California, the chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee, and Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, the ranking Republican on the panel, invited every senator to a briefing with Mr. Clapper and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to discuss expiring provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.
 The provisions â€” â€œone on roving authority for electronic surveillance and the other on the acquisition of business records that are relevant to investigations to protect against international terrorism or espionageâ€\\x9d â€” were added to the 1978 law by the Patriot Act.
 But Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Senateâ€™s No. 2 Democrat, draws a distinction between the holding of such briefings and the informed consent of Congress. Very few lawmakers avail themselves of such briefings, he suggested, and only the most senior leaders are kept fully abreast of intelligence activities.
 â€œYou can count on two hands the number of people in Congress who really know,â€\\x9d he said in an interview on Friday.

TITLE: Benghazi emails underscore State Departmentâ€™s concern over failure to act on warnings

PUBLISHED: 2013/05/13

The resurgent controversy over the Obama administration's initial story-line on the Benghazi attack underscores State Department concerns about the leadership's failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents.
 Draft "talking points" obtained by The Weekly Standard and ABC News depicted efforts by State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland in the days after the attack to strip out references to prior attacks in Benghazi. According to the excerpts, she argued that the administration should not give Congress ammunition to "beat up" on her department.
 During a press conference Monday, President Obama even acknowledged that the country now knows that "clearly (the staff in Benghazi) were not in a position where they were adequately protected."
 A review of now-public State Department records as well as a classified State Department cable, first reviewed and reported by Fox News, shows a steady stream of documented warnings to Washington from intelligence and State security officials on the ground in Libya that the Islamist threat was severe and growing.
 One of the most significant warnings was an August 2012 State Department classified cable, which has not been made public, that summarized an emergency meeting in Benghazi where the CIA briefed on the significant threat of terrorist activity.
 The cable, sent under Ambassador Chris Stevens' signature and marked SECRET, warned the office of Secretary of State Clinton that the CIA advised "ten Islamist militias and AQ training camps (were) within Benghazi."
 The cable also warned that the 17 February Brigade, the group charged with protecting the consulate, appeared to be compromised. It said "requests to provide a daily police presence have gone unanswered," adding there was also a "lack of host nation security support to the US mission."
 In addition to identifying the presence of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi, the groups ultimately blamed for the assault, a key section of the cable, which remains classified, seemed to foreshadow the attack itself.
 "RSO (Regional Security Officer) expressed concerns with the ability to defend Post in the event of a coordinated attack due to limited manpower, security measures, weapons capabilities, host nation support, and the overall size of the compound," it said.
 During congressional hearings in January, Clinton was asked whether she had seen the cable by Republican Rep. Michael McCaul. Clinton said she had no knowledge of the warning which former diplomatic security agents have told Fox News amounted to a "cry for help."
 "Congressman, that cable did not come to my attention," Clinton testified before the House Foreign Affairs committee. "I have made it very clear that the security cable did not come to my attention or above the assistant secretary level where the ARB (Accountability Review Board) placed responsibility where, as I think, Ambassador Pickering said the rubber hit the road."
 In February, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham followed up on the classified cable.
 After the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed he knew about the cable which summarized the August emergency meeting in Benghazi, Graham questioned why the military was read in when Clinton apparently was not.
 Gen. Martin Dempsey responded: "Well, I don't know that she didn't know about the cable."
 Graham said: "She said she didn't. Are you stunned that she didn't?"
 Dempsey said: "I would call myself surprised that she didn't."
 In addition to attacks in Benghazi on the British ambassador -- which forced the temporary closure of the U.K. operation -- the International Red Cross and United Nations, in the summer of 2012 the group Ansar al-Sharia was so well-established it held an annual conference in Benghazi to promote Islamic law.
 Records released by the House oversight committee, including a report from the regional security officer, also documented more than 200 cases of violence in Libya in the year leading up to the attack, specifically between June 2011 and July 2012. Another security review, on June 25, 2012, reported a spike in violence with "foreigners also increasingly targeted."
 While much has been made of the State Department's failure to respond to repeated security requests for extra help, a former diplomatic security agent and 20-year veteran of the department, who reviewed the publicly available documents on the condition of anonymity, told Fox News the multiple warnings present a compelling argument that State Department leadership was negligent.
 The State Department, in a document put out last week, noted that while an internal review found certain senior officials "demonstrated a lack of proactive leadership and management ability" in response to security concerns, there was no specific finding of misconduct.

TITLE: Clinton Benghazi Hearings Show Classified Report Could Not Determine Causes Of Attacks

PUBLISHED: 2013/01/24

WASHINGTON -- The classified version of a State Department review of last year's assault on an American compound in Benghazi, Libya, found that it was impossible to say what exactly motivated the attackers, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton revealed Wednesday.
 Speaking at a pair of hearings on Capitol Hill to examine the Obama administration's handling of and response to the attacks, Clinton repeatedly cited the classified version of the review by a State Department Accountability Review Board, distributed to lawmakers last month.
 "As the ARB makes clear, after their months of research the picture remains still somewhat complicated," Clinton said, during an exchange with Sen. James Risch (R-Idaho) at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "And I say that because in the unclassified ARB, it is -- I quote: 'Key questions surrounding the identity, actions and motivations of the perpetrators remain to be determined.'"
 The question of what motivated the Benghazi attacks has often been viewed as a duality: Either it was the result of a mob angry over a recently released anti-Islamic video, or it was a terrorist attack.
 That the administration wavered over its public declarations of the cause of the assault -- repeatedly citing the video before eventually confirming that it was clearly an act of terrorism -- was widely interpreted among critics as evidence of a desire to suppress or conceal the truth.
 But from the start, the evidence on the scene in Benghazi was more complex.
 Reporters from The New York Times and Reuters who were on the ground immediately after the attacks relayed that people involved in the mob scene around the compound repeatedly cited the video as a cause of their anger.
 The Times later stood by that version of events, citing it in its fact-check of Republican attacks on Obama during the presidential campaign.
 The ARB, in its unclassified form, mentions that the attackers' motivation is the subject of an ongoing FBI investigation. But the classified version, Clinton said, detailed the possible motivations for the attack, and suggested while they were pre-coordinated and deliberate, they were also opportunistic and not planned extensively.
 In citing the classified report to rebuff congressional queries about the administration's handling of the crisis, Clinton was drawing on a powerful tool of her office, although discussing a classified document is sure to raise further questions.
 The added complexity wasn't always satisfying to the legislators who grilled her Wednesday.
 While being questioned at the House Foreign Relations Committee by Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), Clinton urged that he read the classified ARB report to find his answers.
 "There are key questions surrounding the identity, actions and motivations of the perpetrators that remain to be determined," she said. "I recommend that every member read the classified version, which goes into greater detail that I cannot speak to here today.
 To which Duncan replied: "It was a terrorist attack. It's pretty clear what the motivation was."

TITLE: Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick  picks former staffer to fill Kerry's Senate seat

PUBLISHED: 2013/01/30

Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick on Wednesday picked a former chief of staff to fill Sen. John Kerryâ€™s open seat until a special election in June.
 The Democratic governor picked former Chief of Staff William "Mo" Cowan, who also served as Patrickâ€™s chief legal counsel.
 Kerry, also a Democrat and the stateâ€™s senior U.S. senator, was confirmed Tuesday as the new secretary of state, following his nomination by President Obama to replace the retiring Hillary Clinton.
 Both political parties will hold special-election primaries in mid May. But the winner of the Democratic primary will be a likely favorite to win the June 25 special general election, considering Massachusetts is among the most liberal states in the country. Patrick also announced the general election date Wednesday.
 Among the potential Democratic candidates are Reps. Stephen F. Lynch, Michael E. Capuano and Edward Markey.
 The most high-profile potential Republican candidate is former Sen. Scott Brown, who pulled off a surprise 2010 victory in the race for the open seat of Sen. Ted Kennedy. However, Brown lost his re-election bid in November to Democrat Elizabeth Warren.
 Cowan joined the Patrick administration in 2009 and reportedly quit earlier this month to join private practice. He previously practiced civil litigation at the Boston office of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo PC, where he was a partner. He also was a special assistant district attorney in the Office of the Middlesex County District Attorney.
 Cowan is a graduate of Duke University and Northeastern University School of Law. He and wife Stacy have two young sons.
 â€œI am confident this is the right and best choice,â€\\x9d Patrick said at a late-morning press conference.
 The appointment marks the first time in Senate history that two black senators have served at the same time.
 â€œIâ€™m not standing here because Iâ€™m a person of color, but because (the governor) believes I can do the job,â€\\x9d said Cowen, who joins South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott as the chamberâ€™s two black senators.
 Cowmen also emphasized that his assignment is â€œtemporaryâ€\\x9d and that he will work together with Kerryâ€™s team.
 Patrick gave little indication who he favored during his deliberations.
 The only possible candidate he confirmed speaking with was former Democratic Rep. Barney Frank, and then only after Frank told reporters he'd spoken with Patrick.
 Michael Dukakis, the former governor and 1988 Democratic presidential nominee, and Victoria Kennedy, Sen. Kennedyâ€™s widow, had also been mentioned as possible candidates for the interim post.

TITLE: Obama urges new restrictions on assault weapons, magazines as part of gun control plan

PUBLISHED: 2013/01/16

Obama urges new restrictions on assault weapons, magazines as part of gun control plan
 President Obama called Wednesday for a new and tougher assault-weapons ban and a 10-round limit on magazines, as part of a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence that includes 23 steps he took without congressional action.
 Already facing stiff opposition from gun-rights advocates and Republican lawmakers, the president called on Congress to pass several major changes to the country's current gun laws -- some of which are already being considered like the restrictions on semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines.
 Obama called as well for legislation to bar the possession and importation of armor-piercing bullets and to require criminal background checks for nearly all gun sales. The president, speaking at the White House, said he would use "whatever weight this office holds" to get the proposals passed.
 "If there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try," Obama said. "When it comes to protecting the most vulnerable among us, we must act now. ... Let's do the right thing."
 The president was joined by four children who wrote to the White House about gun violence following the Connecticut mass shooting in which 20 children were killed. Though the administration faced some criticism for involving children in the program, they were positioned off to the side while Obama spoke.
 Despite discussions earlier about addressing the pervasive violence in the entertainment and video game industries, the president's plan did not address those issues in depth. The plan, though, does call for a range of measures to improve access to mental health services and improve safety at America's schools.
 The president, immediately after making his remarks, signed nearly two-dozen executive actions -- a step that has stirred objections from lawmakers who have warned Obama not to overstep his bounds.
 Unilaterally, Obama on Wednesday directed federal agencies to share information with the federal background check system; proposed new rules to let law enforcement run full background checks before returning a seized gun; ordered the Centers for Disease Control to research causes of gun violence; required law enforcement to trace guns from criminal investigations; and took other steps. Plus Obama is nominating ATF Acting Director Todd Jones to officially lead the agency
 The most controversial elements of the president's plan, though, continue to be the proposals he wants Congress to pass.
 The call for universal background checks would extend to gun shows and private sales, with "limited" exemptions for "certain transfers" among family members and other situations. The administration plans to give private sellers guidance on how to run background checks as soon as possible.
 Plus the president wants to commit $4 billion to hiring more police officers, and to pass new gun trafficking laws to explicitly prohibit straw purchasing.
 The plan was already earning a mixed response from lawmakers.
 Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., accused Obama of trying to "undermine Americans' constitutional right to bear arms" without doing enough to focus on keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.
 "Nothing the president is proposing would have stopped the massacre at Sandy Hook. President Obama is targeting the 2nd Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens instead of seriously addressing the real underlying causes of such violence," he said.
 Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said "all options should be on the table."
 Texas Gov. Rick Perry, in a written statement, said: "Guns require a finger to pull the trigger. The sad young man who did that in Newtown was clearly haunted by demons and no gun law could have saved the children in Sandy Hook Elementary from his terror."
 Gun-rights groups say the effort to impose more gun control measures is misguided, noting in particular that most killings in America are committed with handguns and not the assault weapons the administration intends to target. Some local officials have vowed to resist federal action.
 The National Rifle Association also plans to launch a major ad campaign. The group's first ad called Obama an "elitist hypocrite" for his daughters' security detail. Obama has been critical of the NRA's plan to install armed security in every school.
 The White House plan does address school security, urging Congress to help schools complete emergency plans; proposing an initiative to help schools hire up to 1,000 resource officers and mental health professionals; and proposing new training for teachers to recognize mental health issues among young people. Obama also plans to beef up mental health coverage via executive action.
 House Speaker John Boehner declined to weigh in on the merits of the president's proposals Wednesday.
 "House committees of jurisdiction will review these recommendations. And if the Senate passes a bill, we will also take a look at that," Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said.

TITLE: William Cowan Named Interim Senator in Massachusetts

 Governor Appoints Ex-Aide to Fill Kerryâ€™s Seat
 BOSTON â€” Gov. Deval Patrick on Wednesday appointed William Cowan, a Boston lawyer who is a longtime friend and former aide, to serve as an interim United States senator until voters chose a successor to John Kerry in a special election set for June 25.
 Mr. Cowan, 43, who is known as Mo, is a former partner in the politically connected law firm of Mintz Levin and will become Massachusettsâ€™ first black senator since Edward Brooke, a Republican, held the seat from 1966 to 1978. His appointment makes Mr. Cowan the second black member to be seated in the current Senate, after Tim Scott of South Carolina was appointed by Gov. Nikki R. Haley.
 Mr. Patrick had said he wanted to appoint someone who did not want to run for the seat later because that person would have to conduct a campaign while learning the ropes in the Senate, and would be unlikely to do either job well. At a packed news conference at the State House, Mr. Cowan said he would not seek the permanent office or use the appointment as a springboard later. â€œThis is going to be a very short political career,â€\\x9d he vowed.
 The clock is now ticking toward the special election. It promises to be another bruising campaign, with two Democratic congressmen likely to face off in a primary in April.
 The biggest question remaining in this drawn-out episode, which began last fall when Mr. Kerryâ€™s name surfaced as a possible successor to Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state, is whether former Senator Scott P. Brown, a Republican, will jump in.
 Mr. Brown has remained mum on the subject, and his camp has sent few signals about his intentions, but he may find the opportunity hard to resist.
 Polls show him beating Representative Edward J. Markey, the only Democrat who has officially declared his candidacy. Mr. Brown has high name recognition and money left over from his unsuccessful race last year against Elizabeth Warren.
 If he entered the race and won, Mr. Brown would be in the awkward position of becoming the junior senator to Ms. Warren, even though she has been in office only a few weeks. The Senate historian said that those who return to the Senate after leaving â€” like Dan Coats of Indiana and Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, for example â€” lose their seniority, although the distinction has little meaning beyond a way to refer to a stateâ€™s senators in the formal oratory of the Senate floor.
 Still, it would be unusual for a state to have two senators who had run against each other, especially in a race that was particularly hard fought.
 The June 25 special election would be Mr. Brownâ€™s third statewide Senate race in three years, starting with his win in a special election in January 2010 to finish Senator Edward M. Kennedyâ€™s term. If he won, he would presumably run in 2014 for a full six-year term â€” or four statewide races in nearly five years.
 So far, the only Democrat in the race is Mr. Markey, 66, a liberal and dean of the stateâ€™s Congressional delegation. Several Democrats, including Mr. Kerry, have closed ranks behind him in the hopes of discouraging anyone else from getting in and avoiding a bruising primary.
 But Representative Stephen F. Lynch, a conservative Democrat from South Boston, is expected to announce Thursday that he will challenge Mr. Markey. The primary would be held on April 30.
 The rough and tumble of the coming campaign seemed far away at Wednesdayâ€™s news conference, which was attended by Mr. Cowanâ€™s wife, Stacey, and their two young sons.
 â€œHeâ€™s cool,â€\\x9d Lt. Gov. Timothy Murray said of Mr. Cowan. â€œTom Brady, George Clooney, James Bond and the president have nothing on Mo.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Cowan, who usually wears a bow tie but opted not to for this occasion, is a former chief of staff and chief legal counsel to Mr. Patrick, the stateâ€™s first black governor. From 1997 to 2009, he practiced civil litigation as an associate and later a partner in the Boston office of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky & Popeo. He also served as a special assistant district attorney in Middlesex County. He left the Patrick administration last year to return to the private sector, but said this brief detour to Washington was a sacrifice worth making because he wanted to give something back to the state that had given him so much.
 Mr. Cowan said at the news conference that he was proud to take the post, noting that his mother, who was home in North Carolina recovering from knee surgery, was a child of the segregated South and had not attended college. The death of Mr. Cowanâ€™s father at a young age left her to raise her children alone.
 Despite her hardships, he said, â€œMy mother told me that days like this were possible.â€\\x9d
 He seemed to be a quick study in the senatorial art of not answering questions definitively. Asked, for example, if he would vote for military cuts if they cost jobs in Massachusetts, he called for â€œa balanced approach,â€\\x9d with some cuts and some revenue growth.
 Mr. Patrick showed similar deftness, skirting a question about why he had not picked former Representative Barney Frank, who had asserted that he would have loved the interim appointment.
 Mr. Cowan said that he would be relying on Mr. Kerryâ€™s staff in Washington and in Massachusetts for guidance and that he intended to continue Mr. Kerryâ€™s work. â€œThere wonâ€™t be any daylight there at all,â€\\x9d he said.
 Mr. Patrick, who has served as a mentor to Mr. Cowan, was asked whether he saw some of himself in Mr. Cowan.
 â€œIâ€™m not that cool,â€\\x9d the governor replied.

TITLE: Jesse Jackson Jr. Pleads Guilty in Campaign Money Case

PUBLISHED: 2013/02/20

WASHINGTON â€” Jesse L. Jackson Jr., the former Democratic representative from Illinois, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to one felony fraud count in connection with his use of $750,000 in campaign money to pay for living expenses and buy items like stuffed animals, elk heads and fur capes.
 As part of a plea agreement, prosecutors recommended that Mr. Jackson receive a sentence of 46 to 57 months in prison. The federal judge overseeing the case, Robert L. Wilkins, is scheduled to sentence Mr. Jackson on June 28.
 â€œFor years I lived off my campaign,â€\\x9d Mr. Jackson, 47, said in response to questions from the judge about the plea. â€œI used money I shouldnâ€™t have used for personal purposes.â€\\x9d
 At one point during the hearing, the judge stopped his questioning of Mr. Jackson, who was crying, so that he could be given a tissue.
 â€œGuilty, Your Honor â€” I misled the American people,â€\\x9d Mr. Jackson said when asked whether he would accept the plea deal. Mr. Jacksonâ€™s father, the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, his mother and several brothers and sisters accompanied him to the hearing.
 Mr. Jacksonâ€™s wife, Sandi, also accompanied him, and later in the day she pleaded guilty to a charge that she filed false income tax statements during the time that Mr. Jackson was dipping into his campaign treasury. Prosecutors said they would seek to have her sentenced to 18 to 24 months.
 Mr. Jacksonâ€™s plea was yet another chapter in the downward spiral of his career. Elected to Congress in 1995 at the age of 30 from a district that includes part of the South Side of Chicago, Mr. Jackson was once one of the most prominent young black politicians in the country, working on issues related to health care and education for the poor.
 But as the federal authorities investigated Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois over his efforts to sell the Senate seat that President Obama vacated in 2008, they uncovered evidence that one of Mr. Jacksonâ€™s friends had offered to make a contribution to Mr. Blagojevichâ€™s campaign in exchange for the seat. Since then, Mr. Jackson, who has said he had no knowledge of the offer, has been dogged by questions about his ethics.
 Last summer, Mr. Jackson took a medical leave from Congress and was later treated for bipolar disorder. After winning re-election in November, he resigned, citing his health and the federal investigation into his use of campaign money.
 After the hearing, Mr. Jacksonâ€™s lawyer, Reid H. Weingarten, said his client had â€œcome to terms with his misconduct.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Weingarten said that Mr. Jackson had serious health issues that â€œdirectly relatedâ€\\x9d to his conduct.
 â€œThatâ€™s not an excuse, itâ€™s just a fact,â€\\x9d Mr. Weingarten said.
 Court papers released by federal prosecutors on Wednesday provided new details about how Mr. Jackson and his wife used the $750,000 in campaign money to finance their lavish lifestyle.
 From 2007 to 2011, Mr. Jackson bought $10,977.74 worth of televisions, DVD players and DVDs at Best Buy, according to the documents. In 2008, Mr. Jackson used the money for things like a $466.30 dinner at CityZen in the Mandarin Oriental in Washington and a $5,587.75 vacation at the Marthaâ€™s Vineyard Holistic Retreat, the document said.
 On at least two instances, Mr. Jackson and his wife used campaign money at Build-A-Bear Workshop, a store where patrons can create stuffed animals. From December 2007 through December 2008, the Jacksons spent $313.89 on â€œstuffed animals and accessories for stuffed animalsâ€\\x9d from Build-A-Bear, according to the documents.
 One of the more exotic items they bought was an elk head from a taxidermist in Montana. According to the documents, Mr. Jackson arranged in March 2011 to have $7,000 paid to the taxidermist, with much of the money coming from a campaign account, and it was shipped a month later to Mr. Jacksonâ€™s Congressional office.
 A year later, Mr. Jacksonâ€™s wife, knowing that the elk head had been bought with campaign money, had it moved from Washington to Chicago, and she asked a Congressional staff member to sell it, the documents say.
 In August 2012, the staff member sold the elk head for $5,300 to an interior designer and had the money wired to one of Mr. Jacksonâ€™s accounts. What the staff member did not know was that the interior designer was actually an undercover F.B.I. employee who was investigating the Jacksons, the documents say.
 Documents released on Friday showed how Mr. Jackson used his campaign money to buy items like fur capes, celebrity memorabilia and expensive furniture.
 Among those items were a $5,000 football signed by American presidents and two hats that once belonged to Michael Jackson, including a $4,600 fedora.

TITLE: Gay Marriages Get Recognition From the I.R.S.

PUBLISHED: 2013/08/29

WASHINGTON â€” All same-sex couples who are legally married will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, even if the state where they live does not recognize their union, the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service said Thursday.
 It is the broadest federal rule change to come out of the landmark Supreme Court decision in June that struck down the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, and a sign of how quickly the government is moving to treat gay couples in the same way that it does straight couples.
 The June decision found that same-sex couples were entitled to federal benefits, but left open the question of how Washington would actually administer them. The Treasury Department answered some of those questions on Thursday. As of the 2013 tax year, same-sex spouses who are legally married will not be able to file federal tax returns as if either were single. Instead, they must file together as â€œmarried filing jointlyâ€\\x9d or individually as â€œmarried filing separately.â€\\x9d
 Their address or the location of their wedding does not matter, as long as the marriage is legal: a same-sex couple who marry in Albany, N.Y., and move to Alabama are treated the same as a same-sex couple who marry and live in Massachusetts.
 â€œTodayâ€™s ruling provides certainty and clear, coherent tax-filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide,â€\\x9d Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said. â€œThis ruling also assures legally married same-sex couples that they can move freely throughout the country knowing that their federal filing status will not change.â€\\x9d
 Gay and civil rights groups praised the ruling. â€œCommitted and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under our nationâ€™s federal tax laws, regardless of what state they call home,â€\\x9d said Chad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign. â€œThese families finally have access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act.â€\\x9d
 But the Treasury decision could have ramifications for many gay couplesâ€™ tax liabilities, said Roberton Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington. Couples with similar incomes often pay the â€œmarriage penalty,â€\\x9d with their tax liability as a couple being much higher than it would be if they were single.
 At the same time, same-sex couples will also be able to file amended returns for certain prior tax years, meaning that many couples might be eligible for refunds. Couples do not have to file amended returns if they do not want to, a senior Treasury official said, meaning that couples who might pay the marriage penalty would not owe back taxes.
 But the ruling creates complications for same-sex couples who live in any of the 37 states that do not recognize their marriages. Previously, such couples filed federal and state tax returns as individuals. Now, they will have to file their federal returns as other married couples do, but may be required to file their state returns as individuals.
 â€œThereâ€™s going to be a cumbersome workaround,â€\\x9d said Nanette Lee Miller of Marcum L.L.P., a public accounting firm. She sees it as a paperwork bother more than a financial issue.
 States might also respond to the federal ruling with changes of their own. â€œMost state income tax regimes begin with federal taxable income as the starting point,â€\\x9d Marvin Kirsner, a tax lawyer at Greenberg Traurig, said in an e-mail. â€œThese state taxing authorities will have to figure out how to deal with a same-sex married couple who file a joint income tax return for federal tax purposes.â€\\x9d He added,
 â€œWe will need to see guidance from each nonrecognition state to see how this will be handled.â€\\x9d
 The rule change is likely to provide a small increase for federal revenue, as more same-sex couples pay the marriage penalty, Mr. Williams said, describing it as a â€œrounding error.â€\\x9d But it would be partly offset by new federal spending on benefits for same-sex spouses.
 The ruling applies to all legal marriages made in the United States or foreign countries. But it does not extend to civil unions, registered domestic partnerships or other legal relationships, the Treasury said.
 The Treasury ruling is one of many that are starting to emerge from all corners of the federal government as Washington changes regulations to conform with the Supreme Court decision.
 Separately, the Health and Human Services Department said Thursday that Medicare would extend certain key benefits to same-sex spouses, â€œclarifying that all beneficiaries in private Medicare plans have access to equal coverage when it comes to care in a nursing home where their spouse lives.â€\\x9d
 But federal agencies are not moving in lock step. Instead, they are creating a patchwork of regulations affecting gay and lesbian couples â€” and may be raising questions about discrimination and fairness in the way that federal benefits are distributed.
 Medicare and Treasury officials have said they would use a â€œplace of celebrationâ€\\x9d standard for determining whether gay couples are eligible for benefits. That means same-sex couples would receive benefits as long as they are legally married, regardless of where they live.
 But the Social Security Administration is now using a â€œplace of residenceâ€\\x9d standard in determining spousal benefits, and a gay couple in Alabama might not receive the same benefits as a gay couple in New York until final determinations are made or Congress acts. The Obama administration has pushed federal agencies to ensure the Supreme Courtâ€™s ruling is carried out quickly and smoothly.
 â€œIt would be nice if they were consistent,â€\\x9d Ms. Miller said. Creating federal regulations is a process and could change, she said.

TITLE: IRS extends tax benefits to married gay couples

PUBLISHED: 2013/08/29

WASHINGTON â€“ Legally married same-sex couples will now be allowed to file federal joint tax returns, the IRS and Treasury Department announced Thursday. The ruling allows homosexual couples to receive the same tax benefits that heterosexual couples do when filing jointly.
 Thursdayâ€™s announcement comes on the heels of a historic decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which overturned a part of the Defense of Marriage Act earlier this year.
 Questions were raised following the high courtâ€™s decision on how the federal government would treat same-sex couples whose home states donâ€™t recognize gay marriage.
 The rules issued Thursday said the policies would affect all legally married gay couples regardless of where they live. The rules, though, would not apply to domestic partnerships and civil unions.
 "Today's ruling provides certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide. It provides access to benefits, responsibilities and protections under federal tax law that all Americans deserve," Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said in a written statement.
 Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said that, because of todayâ€™s ruling, â€œcommitted and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under our nationâ€™s federal tax laws, regardless of what state they call home.â€\\x9d
 He added, â€œThese families finally have access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act.â€\\x9d
 Not everyone was on board with the decision.
 Brian Brown, president of the National Organization of Marriage, believes that giving same sex couples the right to file jointly â€œcontinues a pattern of lawlessnessâ€\\x9d across the country.
 "The Obama administration is intent on forcing same-sex 'marriage' on an unwilling public," Brown said in a written statement. "Congress alone has the responsibility of determining federal tax law."

TITLE: Obama Gun Control Proposals Unveiled, Marking Biggest Legislative Effort In A Generation

Obama Gun Control Proposals Unveiled, Marking Biggest Legislative Effort In A Generation
 WASHINGTON -- In a bold and potentially historic attempt to stem the increase in mass gun violence, President Barack Obama unveiled on Wednesday the most sweeping effort at gun control policy reform in a generation.
 "This is our first task as a society: keeping our children safe. This is how we will be judged," Obama said. â€œWe canâ€™t put this off any longer."
 The proposal, which comes at the end of a month-long review process spearheaded by Vice President Joe Biden, is broken down into four key subsections: law enforcement, the availability of dangerous firearms and ammunition, school safety and mental health.
 In an effort to touch on all four of those elements, the president recommended requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales; reinstating the assault weapons ban; restoring a 10-round limit on ammunition magazines; eliminating armor-piercing bullets; providing mental health services in schools; allocating funds to hire more police officers; and instituting a federal gun trafficking statute, among other policies. The cost of the package, senior officials estimated, would be roughly $500 million, some of which could come from already budgeted funds.
 Because these recommendations require congressional approval, the administration is supplementing its proposal with 23 executive actions that will be taken immediately. Those actions include requiring federal agencies to hand over relevant data for a background check system; providing law enforcement officials, first responders and school officials with better training for active shooting situations; directing the Centers for Disease Control to research the causes and prevention of gun violence; and many more.
 "I intend to use whatever weight this office holds to make them a reality," said the president, speaking about his full set of recommendations. "If there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try."
 The approach is so sweeping that what would have otherwise been a headline-grabbing announcement received second billing. The president on Wednesday will nominate Byron Todd Jones, the acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to take over the post permanently.
 In total, the proposal goes beyond what most gun control advocates were hoping for at the start of Biden's review process, during which he held 22 different meetings with 229 different organizations and 31 elected officials.
 "This is a monumental moment. It's a long time coming and we're thrilled the president's putting the full weight of his office behind this," said Josh Horowitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. "We're ready to push this thing through."
 But putting together ideas is the easy part. Selling them on the Hill will take a bit of legislative craft.
 Seasoned political observers have questioned whether it makes more sense to break the package into separate bills or push for one comprehensive proposal. A senior administration official said that the president's proposal shouldn't be considered finalized legislative language, but rather a series of recommendations for Congress to consider. The president would be working with lawmakers to move the process forward, the official added, and would be trying to build up public opinion as well.
 "I will put everything I've got into this and so will Joe [Biden]. But I tell you, the only way we can change is if the American people demand it," said Obama. "We are going to need voices in those areas and congressional districts where the tradition of gun ownership is strong."
 "It can't just be the usual suspects," he continued. "This will not happen unless the American people demand it."
 The gun-rights lobby has already signaled that it will try to block the administration's effort. A spokesman for the National Rifle Association did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the president's proposal. But the organization has already harshly criticized the Obama administration for overreach.
 "It is unfortunate that this administration continues to insist on pushing failed solutions to our nation's most pressing problems," the NRA said after meeting with Biden last week. "We will not allow law-abiding gun owners to be blamed for the acts of criminals and madmen."
 The group continued its offensive this week, launching an advertising campaign attacking Obama as an "elitist hypocrite" for opposing the NRA's widely-criticized proposal, made after the Newtown, Conn. shooting, to place armed guards in all of the nation's schools.
 But that attack appeared a bit premature. As part of its policy recommendations, the White House called on Congress to act on an old administration proposal to spend $4 billion to keep 15,000 cops on the streets. In addition, the president is proposing a new initiative that would incentivize police departments to hire more school resource officers and encourage schools to hire more mental health professionals. The president's plan also calls on Congress to allocate resources to help schools, other educational institutions and houses of worship develop emergency management plans.
 The White House proposals, even officials there admit, are not a cure-all for mass shootings. Among the suggested recommendations on the gun-policy front, only the ban on high-capacity magazines could have had a tangible impact on the shooting in Newtown, and it's unclear what, exactly, the effect would have been.
 Moreover, the administration is pointedly not going after those weapons and ammunition magazines that are currently and lawfully owned. The proposal would instead affect the future production and sale of military-style weapons or high-capacity magazines.
 "We are not going to go after existing stock of weapons or magazines," said a senior administration official. "We are going to limit it to the manufacturing of assault weapons and clips going forward."
 The White House nevertheless insists that its package of proposals has teeth. It would provide law enforcement with the mechanisms needed to go after the illegal transfer of weapons and help prevent those weapons from falling into the wrong hands. It would also stem the use of military-style weapons -- the White House says its proposal would improve on the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, which was riddled with loopholes -- and give schools and communities resources to address violence when it occurs.
 The question, in some respects, is not what's missing from the set of ideas, but what took the administration so long to get to this point.
 "It is not as though we had this whole policy paper sitting on the shelf somewhere," said a senior administration official. "[We worked] 24/7 for the past month. And we met with a lot of groups and we learned a lot of ideas that came as a result of this process. We tried to be as comprehensive as possible. We are hoping that as the process goes on and as the debate goes on, we might come up with some other ideas."

TITLE: Mo Cowan Senate: Deval Patrick Names Former Chief Of Staff To Replace John Kerry

PUBLISHED: 2013/01/30

Mo Cowan Senate: Deval Patrick Names Former Chief Of Staff To Replace John Kerry
 WASHINGTON -- Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick (D) on Wednesday appointed William "Mo" Cowan to the Senate seat vacated by newly confirmed Secretary of State John Kerry. Cowan will hold the seat in an interim capacity until an election in June.
 Patrick, Cowan and Lt. Governor Tim Murray were all smiles as they walked into a news conference to announce the appointment.
 "He's cool," Murray said of Cowan. "Tom Brady, George Clooney, James Bond, the president have nothing on Mo."
 "It was a private fact, but now known publicly thanks to the lieutenant governor, that he also brought cool," Patrick said to laughs. He and Cowan shook hands and hugged.
 Cowan, 43, is a former chief of staff and former legal counsel to Patrick. Like Patrick, who grew up on the South Side of Chicago before attending Milton Academy, Harvard and Harvard Law, Cowan came from a poor background to Boston for education and made a career there. After growing up in poverty in rural North Carolina, Cowan went to Duke University and then Northeastern University School of Law. He never left, and became a prominent Boston lawyer.
 Cowan's appointment means that there will be two black senators serving together for the first time in American history. Neither was elected -- Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) was appointed in December after former Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) left the chamber in the middle of his term.
 Cowan's selection is a step forward for a state that has a troubled history with race relations, exploding in the South Boston busing riots in the 1970s. Patrick, the state's first African-American governor, said recently on local cable television that it was a priority for him to pick a woman or a person of color for the seat. Cowan will become the second black senator from Massachusetts, after Edward Brooke, who served from 1967 to 1979.
 Patrick on Wednesday was asked to reflect on the fact that eight years ago, the highest black official in the state was Suffolk County D.A. Ralph Martin. Patrick said it was important to have black elected officials, adding, "the commonwealth and the country [are] changing."
 Cowan said Patrick offered him the job on Tuesday, and he accepted.
 He said there would be "no daylight" between him and Kerry on policy. When asked about the looming sequester, he said the "best-case scenario" was a "balanced approach" of spending cuts and tax increases. "I don't think anyone believes it's in the best interest to do straight across-the-board cuts," he said.
 Patrick has consistently said that the pick to succeed Kerry should not run in the general election slated for June 25. Cowan embraced the temporary appointment Wednesday, repeating over and over that his stint would be short. Asked about his political future, he said, "I am not running for office; I am not a candidate in the future."
 The late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) requested in a letter written before his death that the interim pick to replace him not run in the general election, a principle that Patrick honored after Kennedy died by picking Kennedy's longtime chief of staff, Paul Kirk.
 Former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) was the only person to publicly campaign for the interim appointment, announcing his desire to fill the seat on MSNBC and doing subsequent interviews about it. Frank promised that he would not run in the June election if appointed, and he endorsed Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) for Senate, though the two fought over the redistricting process that Frank blamed for his exit from the House of Representatives. Progressive groups lined up to rally support for Frank, but Patrick reportedly bristled at his public pursuit of the seat.
 Frank praised Cowan in a brief statement Wednesday. "I know Mr. Cowan is committed to working hard and in a socially fair and economically efficient manner toward solving pending budget issues," he said. â€œI now look forward to working for the election of Ed Markey to continue this work, and to providing President Obama the support he deserves in carrying out the mandate he received in November." A Frank representative did not respond to interview requests from The Huffington Post.
 The only announced candidate for the general election is Markey, who has received a flood of endorsements from Democrats -- including Kerry -- and has a $3.1 million war chest. Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) is expected to announce his bid Thursday for the seat. Lynch holds more conservative positions than Markey; he opposes abortion rights and voted against President Barack Obama's health care law.
 Former Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) has not said what he will do, but the Associated Press reported Tuesday that he was "leaning strongly" towards a run and would likely announce his candidacy early next week. Brown has kept a low public profile since leaving the Senate in January, other than lashing out at his Twitter critics in a string of messages early Saturday morning.

TITLE: I.R.S. Official Invokes 5th Amendment at Hearing

PUBLISHED: 2013/05/22

WASHINGTON â€” The Internal Revenue Service official who first disclosed that the agency had targeted conservative groups for special scrutiny, and in doing so ignited a controversy that has ensnared the White House, denied on Wednesday that she had ever provided false information to Congress. She then invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and declined to testify at a House hearing on the agencyâ€™s actions.
 As the official, Lois Lerner, appeared under subpoena before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, she sternly told her questioners that accusations that she had misled Congress in previous testimony were false.
 â€œI have not done anything wrong. I have not broken any laws,â€\\x9d said Ms. Lerner, who leads the I.R.S.â€™s division on tax-exempt organizations. â€œI have not violated any I.R.S. rules and regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other Congressional committee.â€\\x9d
 Ms. Lerner has become a person of intense interest to Congressional investigators, who insist that she made, at best, incomplete statements when she said she first learned that her subordinates had singled out Tea Party groups after reading news media reports last year. An inspector generalâ€™s report found, however, that she was briefed on their actions as early as June 2011.
 After she refused on Wednesday to say anything more to the committee, despite attempts by Representative Darrell Issa of California, the committeeâ€™s Republican chairman, to persuade her otherwise, Mr. Issa tried to dismiss her and her lawyer. But that upset other Republicans, who said that Ms. Lerner should not be let go so quickly.
 â€œYou donâ€™t get to tell your side of the story and then not be subjected to cross-examination,â€\\x9d said Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina. â€œShe ought to stand here and answer our questions.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Issa made a second attempt to persuade her to change her mind. But when she declined, he dismissed her again. Ms. Lerner then left the hearing room with her lawyer to a whir of camera shutters.
 That exchange set the tone for a contentious hearing that veered into veiled accusations that the White House had a larger role in the controversy than previously disclosed, as well as outright attacks on President Obamaâ€™s character.
 Mr. Issa said he reserved the right to recall Ms. Lerner later. And he may elect to do so, given the objections of some Republicans on Wednesday after he dismissed her. They argued that by making an opening statement, she had waived her Fifth Amendment right and could be compelled to testify, a contention Ms. Lernerâ€™s lawyer disputed.
 The committee also heard testimony from Douglas H. Shulman, the former I.R.S. commissioner; Neal S. Wolin, the deputy secretary of the Treasury Department; and J. Russell George, the Treasury inspector general who looked into the accusations of targeting. And as the hearing continued, Republicans and Democrats pressed ahead with one point on which they agree these days: that an inept I.R.S. had committed serious misdeeds.
 â€œThe power to tax is the power to destroy,â€\\x9d Mr. Issa said.
 Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the committee, also scolded the agency. â€œI believe there was gross incompetence and mismanagement,â€\\x9d he said. â€œWe are better than that. We are simply better than that.â€\\x9d
 But Mr. Cummings also admonished his Republican colleagues. â€œI think we need to be very, very careful not to let partisanship undermine the integrity not only of the committee but our investigation and our work product,â€\\x9d he said.
 The hearing, the second this week on the I.R.S.â€™s efforts to target conservative groups, offered few new revelations. Mr. George did shed some light on the extent of the accusations against the I.R.S., saying that at this point in this investigation he had no reason to believe any illegal conduct occurred. â€œWe do not deem it illegal. We do not believe that it was illegal, what they did,â€\\x9d he said.
 At times, committee members could hardly conceal their contempt for the I.R.S. and the Obama White House.
 Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, tried to link the I.R.S. scandal with other controversies that are dogging the Obama administration.
 â€œThis administration, which told us and told the American people that the attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi was the work, was caused by a video, is now the same administration who expects us to believe that this scandal was just the result of two rogue agents in Cincinnati,â€\\x9d he said. â€œThe people donâ€™t buy it.â€\\x9d
 Representative James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, said the way that applicants for tax-exempt status were buried in I.R.S. paperwork reminded him of another sore point that Republicans have with the Obama administration.
 â€œMan, that sounds like the Keystone Pipeline to me,â€\\x9d he said, referring to the proposed cross-country oil pipeline that the president has so far declined to approve.
 One Democrat, Representative Stephen F. Lynch of Massachusetts, even raised the threat of appointing a special prosecutor if Congress continues to feel that the I.R.S. is not being straightforward.
 â€œWe know where that will lead. It will lead to a special prosecutor,â€\\x9d he said. â€œThere will be hell to pay if thatâ€™s the route we choose to go down.â€\\x9d
 Later, Mr. Jordan pressed Mr. Shulman, the former I.R.S. commissioner, on whether he had visited the White House. When Mr. Shulman said he had, Mr. Jordan produced White House visitor records that he said indicated Mr. Shulman had been there at least 118 times. Was he sure, Mr. Jordan asked, that the I.R.S. targeting never came up?
 â€œOne hundred-eighteen visits and it didnâ€™t come up in casual conversation?â€\\x9d Mr. Jordan said.
 In follow-up questioning by Representative Gerald E. Connolly, a Virginia Democrat, Mr. Shulman offered what he said was one of the many plausible explanations why he would have visited the White House. â€œThe Easter Egg Roll with my kids,â€\\x9d he said.

TITLE: Jackson Jr. Pleads Guilty

PUBLISHED: 2013/02/20

WASHINGTON -- Former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) pleaded guilty in a federal courtroom Wednesday morning to using campaign funds to purchase an array of personal items including Bruce Lee memorabilia, a $43,000 Rolex watch and a mink cashmere cape.
 He pleaded guilty to conspiracy before U.S. District Judge Robert L. Wilkins. His wife, Sandra Jackson, who resigned from her position on Chicagoâ€™s city council, is expected to plead guilty to filing false tax returns before the same judge on Wednesday afternoon.
 Jackson, dressed in a blue tie, blue shirt and a blue suit, looked back in the direction of his father and wife several times during the hearing. At one point he appeared to mouth, "I'm sorry." The former representative, who co-wrote a 1999 book with his father, Rev. Jesse Jackson, titled It's About the Money!: How You Can Get Out of Debt, Build Wealth, and Achieve Your Financial Dreams, was accused of spending $750,000 in campaign funds on personal items for himself and for his wife.
 Jackson said he was clearheaded and had not been under treatment for alcohol or drug abuse, though he did have a beer last night. He said he had never been more clear in his life, and had read the documents thoroughly and had understood the consequences of his actions.
 He acknowledged he "used money that shouldn't have been used," calling the government's statement accurate and saying he had "no interest in wasting the taxpayers' time or money."
 The judge set the sentencing for June 28 at 2 p.m. Jackson will be free to go after he surrenders his passport, and will be restricted to living in the D.C. or Chicago area.
 The former national co-chairman of President Barack Obamaâ€™s 2008 presidential campaign, Jackson was first elected to office in 1995 and resigned from Congress last year amid a federal investigation and his treatment for bipolar disorder.
 In a statement issued by his lawyers on Friday after court records indicated he planned a guilty plea, Jackson said he had â€œno excusesâ€\\x9d for his conduct and â€œfully accept my responsibility for the improper decisions and mistakes I have made.â€\\x9d
 UPDATE 2:52 p.m. -- Additional records disclosed Wednesday revealed that expenses charged by Jackson and his wife to his campaign included $4,272.78 on the Navigator of the Seas cruise, $2,306.08 at Walt Disney World, over $10,000 at Best Buy, over $300 at Build-A-Bear, $3,544.00 at Mariel's Boutique, and $5,687.75 on Martha's Vineyard Holistic Retreat. The personal expenses at nightclubs and lounges topped $60,000, while personal dry-cleaning expenses topped $14,000.

TITLE: IRS official who refused to testify facing more scrutiny over scandal, past

PUBLISHED: 2013/05/23

The IRS official who refused to testify at a House hearing Wednesday has become a key focus of the congressional investigations into the IRS practice of singling out conservative groups.
 Now under the protection of her lawyers and the Fifth Amendment, Lois Lerner is facing a maelstrom of controversy.
 Members of Congress are calling her evasive, and question why she didn't reveal the program sooner -- plus her history at the Federal Elections Commission is coming under scrutiny.
 Lerner touched off the public controversy when, at an American Bar Association conference earlier this month, she apologized for the IRS' practice of targeting conservative organizations for additional scrutiny. It was the first time the agency acknowledged the practice.
 "They used names like Tea Party or patriots ... and they selected cases simply because the application had those names in the title," she admitted.
 She said she hadn't revealed the information sooner, because she was never asked. But just two days before the ABA conference, Lerner was specifically asked about the investigation.
 Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., asked her if she could "comment briefly on the status on the IRS investigation into these political not-for-profits."
 She said: "Well there's a questionnaire that began this discussion and there's also a questionnaire out there that is seeking info from 501 c3,4,5 organizations."
 Crowley later called her answer evasive.
 "The bottom line is you cannot lie to Congress, and you cannot be evasive, you cannot try to mislead Congress," he said.
 In the 1990's, Lerner also served as chief of enforcement at the Federal Elections Commission.
 Under her direction, the FEC undertook the largest enforcement action in its history -- suing the Christian Coalition for violating campaign laws. The Christian Coalition won, but in one deposition, FEC lawyers asked a defendant if televangelist Pat Robertson prayed for him.
 James Bopp, the Christian Coalition's lawyer, said he was "shocked and appalled" by that.
 "Both political activity and religious activity are specifically protected by the First Amendment," he said.
 When Bopp learned years later that Lerner had been promoted to an IRS position, he became concerned.
 "She was in effect being promoted for what she had done at the Federal Election Commission and now was going to be expected ... to replicate that at the IRS and now we know that's exactly what happened," he said.
 Lerner is represented by lawyer William W. Taylor, who is noted for winning a dismissal of all charges against former IMF director Dominique Strauss-Kahn in a high-profile sexual assault case.
 Lerner said at Wednesday's hearing that she had done nothing wrong.
 "I have not done anything wrong," she said. "I have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee."

TITLE: NRA urges states to allow more armed officers in schools

PUBLISHED: 2013/04/02

NRA urges states to allow more armed officers in schools
 The National Rifle Association called Tuesday for state legislatures to allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds once they've gone through extensive training, as part of a set of recommendations that capped a weeks-long review in the wake of the Newtown mass shooting.
 The NRA initially took criticism from Democrats for focusing so closely on school security, and rejecting gun control measures, following the Connecticut shooting in which 26 people were killed. NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre in December called for armed officers to be installed in every school in the country.
 Former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, who led the NRA's review, appeared to ease off slightly on the call for armed officers in every school -- he said it's "important" for every school to have at least one, but acknowledged these decisions are "locally made" based on unique budget circumstances.
 Hutchinson, though, did call for the creation of a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers. To accompany that, his group proposed a "model" state law that would allow certain personnel who have undergone this training to carry weapons on school grounds.
 "This is not talking about all teachers," he said. "Teachers should teach."
 The 225-page report also called for states to require schools to conduct a safety assessment and for a pilot program to be created assessing mental health as a pre-indicator for violence.
 Mark Mattioli, the father of one Newtown shooting victim, also spoke after Hutchinson's announcement to applaud the review effort.
 The review comes as Congress and a number of state legislatures pursue gun control legislation. While a few have focused on school security -- South Dakota has already approved legislation allowing for teachers to be armed -- many have concentrated on enacting or expanding assault weapons bans, strengthening background checks and passing other measures to restrict access to firearms. Connecticut, the home of the Sandy Hook school shooting, is the latest to advance a sweeping gun control proposal -- lawmakers announced a deal Monday on a package that is likely to win approval.
 But LaPierre in December argued that improving school security is paramount. He argued that if banks and members of Congress can have protection, schools across America should be afforded the same security.
 "It's now time for us to assume responsibly for our schools," he said. "The only way to stop a monster from killing our kids is to be permanently involved and invested in a plan of absolute protection."
 He added: "The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun."

TITLE: Republicans challenge Clinton claims on budget cuts, Benghazi cable

Republicans challenge Clinton claims on budget cuts, Benghazi cable
 Republicans are challenging a host of statements made by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Democratic allies during Wednesday's heated Libya testimony -- claiming that complaints about a lack of funding are bogus and questioning the secretary's insistence she never saw urgent cables warning about the danger of an attack.
 The questions come as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee begins its confirmation hearing for Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who was tapped to replace Clinton at the department.
 One issue that may come up is the department's funding. Assertions that State Department posts are left vulnerable because Congress has decided not to fully fund security requests pervaded Wednesday's hearings.
 "Shame on the House for ... failing to adequately fund the administration's request," Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., said
 Clinton, in turn, affirmed their claims, saying budget issues are a "bipartisan problem."
 Budget numbers, though, actually show the overall diplomatic security budget has ballooned over the past decade.
 Democrats point to modest decreases in funding in recent years, and the fact that Congress has approved less than was requested. But Congress often scales back the administration's requests, and not just for the State Department.
 And the complaints tend to overlook the fact that the overall security budget has more than doubled since fiscal 2004.
 For that year, the budget was $640 million. It steadily climbed to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2010. It dipped to $1.5 billion the following year and roughly $1.35 billion in fiscal 2012 -- still far more than it was a decade ago.
 Slightly more has been requested for fiscal 2013.
 It's difficult to tell how much was specifically allocated for Benghazi. Tripoli was the only post mentioned in the department's fiscal 2013 request -- funding for that location did slip, from $11.5 million in fiscal 2011 to $10.1 million the following year.
 Slightly more has been requested for fiscal 2013.
 Still, then-Deputy Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security Charlene Lamb testified in October that the size of the attack -- and not the money -- was the issue.
 Asked if there was any budget consideration that led her not to increase the security force, she said: "No."
 She added: "This was an unprecedented attack in size." Asked again about budget issues, Lamb said: "Sir, if it's a volatile situation, we will move assets to cover that."
 Asked Wednesday about Lamb's testimony, Clinton noted that the review board that examined the Libya attack found budget issues have played a role.
 "That's why you have an independent group like an (Accountability Review Board); that's why it was created to look at everything," Clinton said.
 But Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., said "any suggestion that this is a budget issue is off base, or political."
 Other lawmakers further complained that the State Department has spent millions on lower-priority projects that could have been spent on security.
 Another pivotal issue Wednesday dealt with an Aug. 16 cable. That cable summarized an emergency meeting the day before by the U.S. Mission in Benghazi and warned the consulate could not defend against a "coordinated attack."
 That cable is seen as one of the vital warnings sent out of Libya in the months leading up to the attack. But, to the dismay of lawmakers, Clinton repeatedly said she never saw it.
 "That cable did not come to my attention. I have made it very clear that the security cables did not come to my attention or above the assistant secretary level," Clinton said. "I'm not aware of anyone within my office, within the secretary's office, having seen the cable."
 Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said "somebody within your office should have seen this cable."
 "An emergency meeting was held and a cable sent out on Aug. 16 by the ambassador himself, warning of what could happen. And this meant this cable went unnoticed by your office. That's the bottom line," he said.
 Clinton said it was "very disappointing" that "inadequacies" were found in the "responsiveness of our team here in Washington," and said "it's something we're fixing and intend to put into place protocols and systems to make sure it doesn't happen again."
 The secretary tried to explain that "1.43 million cables" come through the department every year. They are addressed to her but in many cases do not go to her. Rather, they go through "the bureaucracy."
 Republicans argue the Aug. 16 cable was rather high priority. As Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., put it, "Libya has to have been one of the hottest of hot spots around the world." He claimed that not knowing about their security requests "really, I think, cost these people their lives."
 "Had I been president at the time, and I found that you did not read the cables from Benghazi, you did not read the cables from Ambassador Stevens, I would have relieved you of your post. I think it's inexcusable," Paul said.

TITLE: Lois Lerner, IRS Scandal Figure, Will Invoke Fifth Amendment At Oversight Hearing

PUBLISHED: 2013/05/21

Lois Lerner, the director of the exempt organizations unit at the Internal Revenue Service, plans to invoke the Fifth Amendment during her expected testimony before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times reports.
 Lerner announced her plans to plead the Fifth during her testimony in a letter from her lawyer, William Taylor III, to the committee. "She has not committed any crime or made any misrepresentation but under the circumstances she has no choice but to take this course," the letter addressed to Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) reads, according to the Los Angeles Times.
 Since she will be pleading the Fifth, Taylor has asked the committee that she be excused from testifying. The letter from Taylor states that her testimony would "have no purpose other than to embarrass or burden her."
 The Wednesday hearing would have been Lerner's first public appearance, and first under oath, since she apologized for the IRS' inappropriate targeting of conservative groups at a May 10 American Bar Association meeting. That apology was planned ahead of time by the IRS, and came in response to a planted question.
 Issa has issued a subpoena to compel Lerner to appear at the hearing.
 Lerner is a key figure in the unfolding IRS scandal. As director of the IRS exempt organizations unit, she is in charge of the division overseeing nonprofit organizations, which includes the Cincinnati office that was the source of the inappropriate targeting criteria. The criteria directed the IRS to conduct a more intensive review of applications for tax-exempt status from groups with the name "tea party" or "patriot."
 According to the report issued by the Department of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, Lerner had to correct the criteria developed by the Cincinnati office twice because she and other top IRS officials found that they were using politically fraught terms as they sought to make sure groups were properly applying for tax exemption.
 Lerner's decision to plead the Fifth comes as the Department of Justice has initiated an investigation into whether laws were broken at the IRS, according to Taylor's letter to the committee. It also follows a request to Lerner from the committee to provide information on why she gave "false or misleading information" to the committee on four previous occasions in 2012.
 â€œThe Committee has been contacted by Ms. Lernerâ€™s lawyer who stated that his client intended to invoke her 5th amendment right and refuse to answer questions,â€\\x9d Oversight and Government Reform Committee spokesman Ali Ahmad said in a statement. â€œMs. Lerner remains under subpoena from Chairman Issa to appear at tomorrowâ€™s hearing â€” the Committee has a Constitutional obligation to conduct oversight. Chairman Issa remains hopeful that she will ultimately decide to testify tomorrow about her knowledge of outrageous IRS targeting of Americans for their political beliefs.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Elizabeth Cheney blasted by older sister over gay-marriage stance

PUBLISHED: 2013/09/01

Call it Cheney versus Cheney.
 Mary Cheney, one of ex-Vice President Dick Cheneyâ€™s two daughters, has taken to Facebook to blast her older sibling, Elizabeth, a Wyoming Senate candidate, for the latterâ€™s stance on same-sex marriage, The New York Times is reporting.
 Mary Cheney, openly lesbian and married to Heather Poe since 2012, reportedly posted to her personal page on the social media site: â€œFor the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage.
 â€œFreedom means freedom for everyone. That means that all families â€” regardless of how they look or how they are made â€” all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other.â€\\x9d
 The Times reports Liz Cheney on Friday first articulated her position on the controversial subject, saying it should be something for voters to decide on a state-by-state basis, and not a matter for â€œjudgesâ€\\x9d or â€œlegislators.â€\\x9d
 â€œI am not pro-gay marriage,â€\\x9d Liz Cheney reportedly said. â€œI believe the issue of marriage must be decided by the states, and by the people in the states, not by judges and not even by legislators, but by the people themselves.â€\\x9d
 Her sister replied by pulling no punches.
 â€œItâ€™s not something to be decided by a show of hands,â€\\x9d Mary Cheney reportedly wrote on her personal Facebook page, concluding her internecine post by saying, â€œPlease like and share if you agree.â€\\x9d
 Elizabeth Cheney declared in July she plans to challenge incumbent Senator Mike Enzi, also a Republican, in the stateâ€™s Republican primary. The election is slated for 2014.
 Former Vice President Cheney has publicly voiced support for same-sex marriage and, mirroring Elizabethâ€™s stance, has reportedly said the matter should be decided on a state-by-state basis.

TITLE: N.R.A. Details Plan for Armed School Guards

PUBLISHED: 2013/04/02

Report Sees Guns as Path to Safety in Schools
 WASHINGTON â€” With the Senate set to debate gun control this month, a National Rifle Association task force released a 225-page report on Tuesday that called for armed police officers, security guards or staff members in every American school, and urged states to loosen gun restrictions to allow trained teachers and administrators to carry weapons.
 Asa Hutchinson, a former Republican congressman from Arkansas who led the task force, unveiled the report at a packed news conference with unusually heavy security, including a bomb-sniffing yellow Labrador retriever. A dozen officers in plain clothes and uniforms stood watch as he spoke; one warned photographers to â€œremain stationaryâ€\\x9d during the event.
 Among the studyâ€™s central conclusions is that â€œthe presence of armed security personnel adds a layer of security and diminishes response timeâ€\\x9d in a shooting, Mr. Hutchinson said. He cited a 1997 Mississippi case in which an assistant principal ran to his truck to retrieve a .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol and subdued a gunman who had killed two students.
 The recommendations â€” which also included expanding the police presence in schools â€” drew immediate criticism from gun control advocates and many Democrats, who have been fighting to tighten gun restrictions after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in December.
 â€œArming the teacher is merely a response to the last tragedy,â€\\x9d said Representative Mike Thompson, a California Democrat who is chairman of a House task force on gun violence. â€œThe one before that was in a shopping mall in Oregon, and the one before that was in a movie theater in Colorado. I donâ€™t think the proper response is to arm all the projectionists in the movie theaters or all the vendors in the mall.â€\\x9d
 After the Newtown shooting, Wayne LaPierre, the rifle associationâ€™s executive director, announced that it would devise a plan to put armed guards in every school. Technically, Mr. Hutchisonâ€™s task force is independent of the rifle association, even though it paid for the study, and Mr. LaPierre was not present on Tuesday. But critics see no distinction between the two.
 Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Childrenâ€™s Defense Fund, an advocacy group here, criticized the study as â€œnothing more than a continuation of the N.R.A.â€™s attempts to prey on Americaâ€™s fears, saturate our schools with more guns and turn them into armed fortresses.â€\\x9d
 But the report did get support from at least one Newtown parent: Mark Mattioli, whose 6-year-old son, James, was killed.
 â€œI think politics needs to be set aside here, and I hope this doesnâ€™t lead to name-calling,â€\\x9d said Mr. Mattioli, who joined Mr. Hutchinson at the news conference. â€œThis is a recommendation for solutions, real solutions that will make our kids safer. Thatâ€™s what we need.â€\\x9d
 At least one state, Indiana, is considering the idea of armed officers at schools. On Tuesday, a proposal that would require public and charter schools to have an armed â€œprotection officerâ€\\x9d on school property during class hours passed a State House committee.
 The task force panel called on the Departments of Homeland Security, Education and Justice to coordinate school safety efforts and provide grant money for schools to assess their ability to prevent and respond to attacks. It recommended that officers or employees who are armed take a 40- to 60-hour training course to be developed by the rifle association based on a model the task force has designed.
 The group also called on states to require schools to develop security plans.
 But how and whether the task force recommendations will be put into effect â€” and the cost â€” was unclear.
 The timing of Tuesdayâ€™s announcement was not a coincidence: Congress will wrap up its spring recess after this week and is expected to consider gun legislation after lawmakers return. President Obama has called for tough new controls on gun ownership, but the prospects for such legislation are murky â€” a testimony to the rifle associationâ€™s prowess as a lobbying force.
 A plan to revive and revamp a ban on assault weapons, which expired in 2004, is almost certain to be defeated. Mr. Obama is pushing for a measure that would impose mandatory background checks for gun buyers, and the Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, the majority leader, has promised to present a bill that would expand background checks to the floor for a vote.

TITLE: NRA School Safety Report Recommends Arming Teachers, Loosening Gun Laws

PUBLISHED: 2013/04/02

NRA School Safety Report Recommends Arming Teachers, Loosening Gun Laws
 WASHINGTON -- Former Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.) on Tuesday released a 225-page report on school safety funded by the National Rifle Association. The report, commissioned in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, recommended properly trained armed employees to provide "an important layer of security in schools."
 The report was prepared by a 12-person task force, called the School Shield Program, led by Hutchinson. At Tuesday's press conference, he stated that its findings were independent of the nation's largest gun lobby.
 "Teachers should teach, but if there is personnel that has interest and is willing to go through 40 to 60 hours of [firearms] training, then schools should be willing to [arm them]," Hutchinson said. He added that the report found that "local school authorities are in the best position" to determine their own school security measures, "specifically whether an armed security guard is necessary and supported by the education and citizen community."
 The task force recommended that schools designate willing staff to be armed and trained, and it proposed a model training program, 40-60 hours per person, at what Hutchinson said would be a cost of about $800 to $1,000 per trained employee. Armed school personnel, called school resource officers, would also be required to undergo a "background investigation, testing, and [have] relevant experience."
 The committee didn't recommend any specific kind of firearm for school security, Hutchinson said, adding, "Everything from a sidearm, to a shotgun, to an AR-15" would work.
 The task force also suggested that states loosen current legal restrictions on who can carry a firearm on school property. Many states currently prohibit anyone but a law enforcement officer from possessing guns in a school.
 Other recommendations included creating threat assessment teams at schools, better coordinating state and federal funding for school security, and offering an online assessment tool, so that administrators can evaluate their schools' potential security gaps.
 Hutchinson's report and his press conference were both met with scathing criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, which supports broader gun control measures and strongly opposes arming educators. In a statement, union President Randi Weingarten called the report "a cruel hoax that will fail to keep our children and schools safe," adding that the findings "are simply designed to assist gun manufacturers flood the nation and our schools with more guns."
 The NRA also put out a statement on the report, over which the gun lobby insists it had no influence. The NRA said it needs "time to digest" the findings, but it commended Hutchinson and his team for contributions that "will go a long way to making America's schools safer."
 The report marks the culmination of a controversial process that began in December, when NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre held a press conference the week after the shooting in Newtown, Conn. At the time, LaPierre assailed the media and gun control advocates for their responses to the massacre, and he proposed that armed volunteers protect schools and that gun-free school zones be eliminated. The speech was widely considered a public relations disaster.
 Hutchinson said Tuesday that the idea of armed volunteers was scrapped after it was met with "great reluctance" from school employees. But the recommendation that states allow non-law enforcement officers, such as teachers and principals, to carry guns in schools would essentially eliminate gun-free school zones.
 Asked about the current debate in Congress over gun control legislation, Hutchinson said he had "not dealt with the separate debate" because he had been too busy considering school safety issues.
 He did, however, weigh in on state gun control efforts currently being debated in Connecticut, which include a ban on high-capacity magazines and a broader assault weapons ban. Hutchinson called them "totally inadequate."
 "You can address assault weapons, but it doesn't stop violence in schools. So if you're going to protect children, you have to do something about enhancing school safety," he said.
 Hutchinson also encouraged the NRA to continue funding pilot programs to train school employees to carry weapons.
 When he had finished introducing the report, Hutchinson called up Mark Mattioli, whose 6-year-old son, James Mattioli, was killed in December along with 19 other children at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Mattioli praised the NRA "for coming up and spending the time and resources on putting a program like this together."

TITLE: Same-Sex Married Couples To Get Federal Tax Recognition Regardless Of State

PUBLISHED: 2013/08/29

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Department of the Treasury announced Thursday that when it comes to taxes, it will recognize same-sex couples' marriages even if they live in a state that does not.
 The decision, which was prompted by the U.S. Supreme Courtâ€™s ruling to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act, marks the latest political progress for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.
 Prior to this spring, the Internal Revenue Service did not recognize same-sex married couples pursuant to section 3 of DOMA. Once DOMA was overturned in June, the question became: What about same-sex married couples who moved to a state that didnâ€™t recognize their marriage (a couple married in Massachusetts who moved to Arkansas, for example)?
 Thursdayâ€™s ruling by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew provides a uniform policy for the IRS; the state of celebration -- where the wedding took place -- now trumps the state of residency when it comes to federal tax status for same-sex married couples.
 â€œTodayâ€™s ruling provides certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide. It provides access to benefits, responsibilities and protections under federal tax law that all Americans deserve,â€\\x9d Lew said in a statement. â€œThis ruling also assures legally married same-sex couples that they can move freely throughout the country knowing that their federal filing status will not change.â€\\x9d
 The new policy, which was first shared by Lew in a conference call that included LGBT advocates, holds a bit of political significance. It was the burden of federal tax law on same-sex couples, after all, that prompted the legal challenge to DOMA in the first place.
 Edie Windsor, the plaintiff in the DOMA case, sued the government after being forced to pay estate taxes following the death of her wife, Thea Spyer. Had they been a heterosexual couple, Windsor's tax burden would have been zero. After DOMA was overturned, it was reported that the IRS owed Windsor $363,053.
 Under the new Treasury policy, all federal tax provisions where marriage is a factor, including filing status, employee benefits, IRA contributions, earned income, child tax credits, and income, gift and estate taxes, will apply to same sex couples regardless of where they live. On the flip side, gay couples also will now be subjected to the so-called marriage penalty, in which some (usually upper-middle class) joint filers incur a higher tax burden than they would if they filed as single people.
 The policy only applies to married couples, and not those in domestic partnerships or same-sex unions.
 â€œWith todayâ€™s ruling, committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under our nationâ€™s federal tax laws, regardless of what state they call home,â€\\x9d said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin. â€œThese families finally have access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act.â€\\x9d
 The Treasuryâ€™s actions on Thursday are just the latest in a set of LGBT policies offered by agencies within the Obama administration following the DOMA ruling. The Federal Election Commission, and Departments of Health and Human Services and Homeland Security, also extended federal benefits to gay couples in states that donâ€™t recognize their marriages.
 UPDATE: Commenting on the Treasury Department's new policy, Edie Windsor hailed the decision as the precise remedy that she sought when she challenged the constitutionality of DOMA.

TITLE: Obama Defends NSA Programs, Says Congress Knew About Surveillance

PUBLISHED: 2013/06/07

WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama on Friday forcefully defended revelations that the National Security Agency is collecting phone records and electronic communications, saying that Congress was fully briefed and the programs are limited in scope.
 "The programs are secret in the sense that they are classified. They are not secret, in that every member of Congress has been briefed," he said during a speech in San Jose, Calif. "These are programs that have been authored by large bipartisan majorities repeatedly since 2006."
 "Your duly elected representatives have consistently been informed," he said.
 News outlets revealed this week that vast spying programs began under President George W. Bush and have continued under Obama. The Guardian reported Wednesday that the National Security Agency had obtained a court order to collect phone records from Verizon Wireless customers, while The Washington Post reported Thursday of the existence of a program launched in 2007 called PRISM, which tracks information from nine leading U.S. Internet companies: Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, AOL, YouTube, Apple, PalTalk and Skype.
 In response to a question after his speech, Obama defended the programs as essential to combating terrorist threats. "They may identify potential leads with respect to folks who might engage in terrorism," he said.
 He also argued that some have overstated the impact of the programs. "Some of the hype we've been hearing over the past day or so -- nobody has listened to the content of people's phone calls," he said.
 "I welcome this debate and I think it's healthy for our democracy," he continued. "I think it's a sign of maturity, because probably five years ago, six years ago, we might not have been having this debate."
 Obama portrayed the programs as a trade-off between security and civil liberties. "I think it's important to recognize that you can't have 100 percent security, and also then have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience. We're going to have to make some choices as a society," he said.
 He also expressed his displeasure that the domestic spying programs' existence was leaked to the press. "I don't welcome leaks," he said. "There's a reason these programs are classified."
 The president's full-throated defense of the programs, albeit with the qualification that he welcomes debate, is unlikely to quell the outrage over the revelations. Obama ran as an antidote to Bush's policies in 2008, but the reports reveal that he has continued many of them, leading to concerns over the reach of the national security state.
 Obama went on to defend those who operated the programs as "professionals." "In the abstract, you can complain about 'Big Brother' and how this is a potential program run amok. But when you actually look at the details, then I think we've struck the right balance," he said.

TITLE: Jan Brewer Announces Veto Of Arizona Anti-Gay Bill

PUBLISHED: 2014/02/26

WASHINGTON -- Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer (R) announced her decision to veto legislation on Wednesday that would have allowed businesses to legally refuse service to anyone on "religious freedom" grounds, effectively allowing them to discriminate against same-sex couples.
 Brewer said the bill had "the potential to create more problems than it purports to solve."
 "Senate Bill 1062 does not address a specific or present concern related to religious liberty in Arizona," she said. "I have not heard one example where business owners' religious liberty has been violated."
 The state legislature passed the bill, known as SB 1062, last week. But in recent days, it has come under intense criticism from activists, lawmakers and business interests both in Arizona and nationally. The state's two Republican senators, Jeff Flake and John McCain, called on Brewer to veto it, and major corporations like Marriott, Apple and American Airlines all wrote to the governor and expressed their opposition.
 Businesses in the Phoenix area were also especially worried, with the Super Bowl set to be held in Glendale, Ariz. in 2015. On Monday, the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee came out against SB 1062, stating, "[W]e have heard loud and clear from our various stakeholders that adoption of this legislation would not only run contrary to that goal but deal a significant blow to the state's economic growth potential. We do not support this legislation."
 Arizona hasn't been the only state pushing a bill that would allow open discrimination against same-sex couples; similar bills have been popping up in states including Tennessee, Kansas, South Dakota and Maine.
 CORRECTION: This article originally said the Super Bowl is set to be held in Tempe, Ariz. It will be held in Glendale, Ariz.

TITLE: Eric Holder Hears From The People Of Ferguson Face To Face

PUBLISHED: 2014/08/20

FERGUSON, Mo. -- Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday that the â€œeyes of the nation and the worldâ€\\x9d are on this small suburb of St. Louis where an unarmed teenager was shot and killed by police earlier this month. The issues raised by Michael Brown's death, Holder said, have simmered â€œbeneath the surface in more communities than just Ferguson.â€\\x9d
 On Thursday, he told reporters in Washington that the Justice Department would thoroughly investigate the case, and would "continue to stand with Ferguson." He also said that "few things have affected me as greatly as my trip to Ferguson."
 Before a larger meeting at St. Louis Community Collegeâ€“Florissant Valley on Wednesday, the attorney general met with several students at the local school in what he described as an â€œopportunity to sit down with some wonderful young people and to hear them talk about the mistrust they have at a young age.â€\\x9d
 Dominique McCoy, who attended the smaller meeting, told The Huffington Post that Holder said change wouldn't happen overnight. "He just let us speak, basically. He semi-voiced his opinion, but we all did the talking. He agreed somewhat to what everyone said,â€\\x9d McCoy added.
 A separate attendee, Molyrik Welch, noted to another reporter that her brother had died following an encounter with Ferguson police in 2011.
 Holder told the students he understands "the mistrust" between some residents and the police.
 â€œI am the attorney general of the United States, but I am also a black man," Holder said.
 Holder told others at the community college how he had been stopped on the New Jersey Turnpike and accused of speeding twice in the past, with police searching his car.
 "I remember how humiliating that was and how angry I was and the impact it had on me," Holder said.
 "The same kid who got stopped on the New Jersey freeway is now the attorney general of the United States," Holder added. "This country is capable of change. But change doesn't happen by itself."
 After the college events, Holder headed over to Drake's Place restaurant in Ferguson to talk with other community members. Some people were told that they would be meeting with an official from the Justice Department, but not that it was Holder. The owners of the restaurant said they were informed of the event only about an hour ahead of time. The Justice Departmentâ€™s Community Relations Service had arranged for the gatherings.
 Holder was greeted as a star at Drake's Place, posing for selfies and group photos with residents and shaking hands. He settled into a corner booth as residents explained the problems that need to be rectified.
 Soon, Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, who has earned some praise since he took over policing of Ferguson's nightly protests, stopped by to greet the attorney general.
 â€œMy man! You are the man,â€\\x9d Holder said as Johnson walked in.
 After the meeting, attendees said they were thankful that Holder and the federal government were paying attention to Fergusonâ€™s problems.
 â€œHe told me that he was here because he was concerned about everything that was going on and he wanted us to voice our opinions and what did we want to change, and that he was going back to the White House to report so we can get some funding, so we can get a game plan on how to help our community,â€\\x9d Angela Whitman told HuffPost.
 Yvette Townsend-Saunders called the meeting â€œwonderfulâ€\\x9d and said she was thankful that Holder had come to the town.
 â€œHe said that there needs to be some changes made, things need to be looked into and investigated,â€\\x9d Townsend-Saunders said. â€œWhen you were a little boy and you didnâ€™t do something well at school, your mother had to jump in. When the teacher didnâ€™t do something right, the principal had to jump in. I think if you do something right from the bottom, the top doesnâ€™t have to jump in. If things were done right in the beginning, all this wouldnâ€™t have to be.â€\\x9d
 â€œWe didnâ€™t know it was Eric Holder [coming],â€\\x9d Rev. John Paul Hopping of Our Lady of Guadalupe, told HuffPost. â€œThey were really nice and they were really listening. Theyâ€™re looking for solutions and they want to help.â€\\x9d
 At the community college, Holder said that they were starting â€œa good dialogueâ€\\x9d but that it was â€œnot enough.â€\\x9d
 â€œWe need concrete action to change things in this country,â€\\x9d he said, according to excerpts provided by the Justice Department. "This dialogue is important. But it can't simply be that we have a conversation that begins based on what happened on August 9 and ends sometime in December, and nothing happens. As I was just telling these young people, change is possible. The same kid who got stopped on the New Jersey freeway is now the attorney general of the United States. This country is capable of change. But change doesn't happen by itself.â€\\x9d
 In addition to Ferguson community members, Holder spent Wednesday meeting with officials from the St. Louis-based U.S. attorney's office and the local FBI office investigating Brown's death. He is talking with Brown's parents and with members of the local congressional delegation.

TITLE: Who is Dave Brat?

PUBLISHED: 2014/06/10

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor was beaten Tuesday night by a political novice who is currently working as an economics professor at a small Virginia college.
 So who is Dave Brat, and how did he pull off such a stunning win?
 The 49-year-old teaches at Randolph-Macon College, a small liberal arts school north of Richmond. He raised just over $200,000 for his campaign, while Cantor spent more than $1 million in April and May alone to try to beat back his challenge.
 However, Brat offset the cash disadvantage with endorsements from conservative activists like radio host Laura Ingraham and with help from local Tea Party activists angry at Cantor.
 Brat cast the congressman as a Washington insider who isn't conservative enough. Last month, a feisty crowd of Brat supporters booed Cantor in front of his family at a local party convention.
 Brat received his doctorate from American University, his master's from Princeton Theological Seminary and his bachelor's from Hope College. In addition to teaching, he has served on the state Joint Advisory Board of Economists and served as the president of the Virginia Association of Economists.
 He also states on his website that he is active in his local Republican party, and has often served as commentator on economic issues for local media.
 Brat is married and has two children, an 11-year-old daughter and a 15-year-old son.

TITLE: U.S. Attorney Subpoenas Christieâ€™s Campaign and New Jersey G.O.P.

PUBLISHED: 2014/01/23

Federal prosecutors in New Jersey have issued grand jury subpoenas to Gov. Chris Christieâ€™s re-election campaign and to the state Republican Party as part of a preliminary inquiry into accusations that aides to Mr. Christie shut down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge as political retribution, the lawyer for the campaign and the party said Thursday.
 A person briefed on the matter said the prosecutors had also issued subpoenas to some of the 20 people and entities â€” including potential witnesses and people who have come under scrutiny in the inquiry â€” that received subpoenas last week from a New Jersey legislative committee whose investigation largely parallels the federal one.
 â€œWe can confirm that the Christie for Governor re-election campaign and the New Jersey Republican State Committee received subpoenas for documents from the U.S. attorneyâ€™s office, in addition to the subpoena the campaign previously received from the state legislative committee,â€\\x9d the lawyer, Mark D. Sheridan, said in an email.
 Mr. Sheridan is representing the campaign along with Robert D. Luskin; both men are partners at Patton Boggs.
 â€œThe campaign and the state party intend to cooperate with the U.S. attorneyâ€™s office and the state legislative committee and will respond to the subpoenas accordingly,â€\\x9d Mr. Sheridan said.
 According to the person briefed on the matter, the subpoenas, issued by prosecutors in the office of the United States attorney for New Jersey, Paul J. Fishman, seek a broad range of records relating to the lane closings: emails, text messages, other correspondence and memorandums, calendar entries, spreadsheets, voice mail messages.
 They also specifically seek records relating to three close aides to Mr. Christie who resigned or were fired when their roles in the lane closings were revealed. They were the governorâ€™s deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, and Bill Baroni and David Wildstein, two senior officials and allies of Mr. Christie at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the bridge.
 Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and prosecutors from Mr. Fishmanâ€™s office have also undertaken what appears to be an unrelated inquiry. On Saturday, the mayor of Hoboken, Dawn Zimmer, said Mr. Christieâ€™s lieutenant governor and another senior administration official had threatened in May to withhold federal recovery aid for Hurricane Sandy unless she supported a development favored by the Christie administration. On Sunday, Ms. Zimmer issued a statement saying prosecutors in Mr. Fishmanâ€™s office had interviewed her about her accusation.
 The lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, emphatically denied the allegations on Monday. Ms. Zimmerâ€™s account, however, was supported in some measure by two of the mayorâ€™s aides, who were interviewed by F.B.I. agents and told them that Ms. Zimmer had recounted the threat to them around the time she said it occurred, two people briefed on the matter have said. A Hoboken city councilman, David Mello, also said that Ms. Zimmer told him several months later about the encounter with Ms. Guadagno.
 The bridge inquiry being conducted by Mr. Fishmanâ€™s office was confirmed this month. The office said at the time that it would seek to determine whether any federal laws had been broken. The subpoenas issued this week show that prosecutors have begun taking the necessary steps to answer that question.
 A spokeswoman for Mr. Fishmanâ€™s office, Rebekah Carmichael, said Thursday afternoon that she could neither confirm nor deny whether any specific investigative steps had been taken. She has declined to comment on Ms. Zimmerâ€™s allegation.
 Despite the inquiries, Mr. Christie seemed to be trying to conduct business as usual. The Republican Governors Association announced on Thursday that he would make fund-raising trips to Illinois, Texas, Massachusetts, Georgia, Connecticut and Utah in the coming months.

TITLE: Raul Labrador To Run for House Majority Leader

PUBLISHED: 2014/06/13

A two-term Republican congressman from Idaho with a track record of challenging the House Republican leadership said Friday he would run for the No. 2 job in the chamber.
 Raul Labrador, a 46-year-old Mormon father of five, tea party congressman and Puerto Rican-born only child of a single mother, will challenge House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) for the position of House majority leader.
 It's a long shot bid. McCarthy, 49, began gathering commitments from other House Republicans on Wednesday, the day after then-Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) suffered a stunning loss in the primary for his seat.
 In his current role as whip, McCarthy's job is to round up votes from other Republicans. The election is Thursday -- leaving little time for Labrador to build momentum and peel off votes from McCarthy.
 The former immigration attorney stepped forward to run after a number of other conservative House Republicans declined to.
 â€œI was stunned when Eric Cantor lost his primary election earlier this week. Eric is a good friend and I have tremendous respect for him. But the message from Tuesday is clear -- Americans are looking for a change in the status quo," Labrador said in a statement.
 He also said that he would run for majority leader in hopes of creating "a leadership team that can bring the Republican conference together." It's a reference to the fact that Labrador is generally respected by both the House leadership and back-bench tea party legislators.
 Since the 2010 midterm tea party wave election, the House GOP has contained a bloc of members who have opposed the establishment leadership time and time again. The tea party group has pulled other legislators to the right on a host of issues, including many related to government spending and debt.
 When Cantor lost his seat in a shock result Tuesday, conservatives in the House were not prepared to unite behind a standard-bearer, much less wage an organized effort to whip up votes in support of a candidate for majority leader. Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) was considered a front-runner to challenge McCarthy. But Hensarling pondered his options for a full day Wednesday, while McCarthy moved quickly to generate support.
 On Friday, the Washington Post reported that Hensarling does not plan to run, according to three people familiar with his plans.
 Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) was the other conservative alternate to McCarthy, though he is almost as much an establishment character as anyone else in leadership. He too declined to run, sensing McCarthy's near inevitability. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) also demurred.
 The situation left House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and the rest of the Republican leadership in the House with a problem: The 40 or so hardline tea party members of the House GOP do not want the response to Cantor's loss -- which was driven by grassroots discontent with the establishment -- to simply be more establishment leadership. This discontent may be satisfied if Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) wins his race against Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) for House majority whip, taking McCarthy's spot.
 Members of the tea party caucus also want to vote for a majority leader candidate that they believe in, even if he loses. House GOP leadership understands that desire, as does Labrador. A Labrador bid helps all parties regardless of the outcome -- including Labrador himself, since a run will elevate him as a leader inside the House GOP.
 There is always a chance that grassroots fervor in support of Labrador could gain a level of intensity that Boehner and McCarthy did not anticipate. However, there's not a lot of time for that to happen before next Thursday's election, and leadership elections generally are dominated by inside baseball politics and arcane political interests. In addition, a few of the most hardline House Republicans, such as Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) and Rep. Michelle Bachmann (R-Minn.) said Thursday that Labrador was not conservative enough on immigration reform.
 Labrador is an ambitious, sometimes savvy politician. He is in Idaho this weekend chairing the state GOP convention. He also appeared Friday at an event with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who offered his support for Labrador's candidacy.
 â€œThere really is a question what is the message thatâ€™s sent when the voters replace someone in leadership. They want someone different. I think Raul brings that," Paul told reporters, according to the Spokesman-Review.

TITLE: Representative Apologizes for Criticizing Iowa Senator

PUBLISHED: 2014/03/25

WASHINGTON â€” It is a lesson politicians never seem to learn from othersâ€™ mistakes: The microphone is always on.
 The latest candidate to learn the hard way was Representative Bruce Braley, an Iowa Democrat running for Senate this year. Mr. Braley apologized to Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and â€œanyone I may have offendedâ€\\x9d after video emerged of him warning that â€œa farmer from Iowa who never went to law school, never practiced lawâ€\\x9d could become chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
 Mr. Braley is not running against Mr. Grassley, who plans to seek a seventh term in 2016. But as the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Grassley could assume the chairmanship if his party takes control of the Senate this year. Mr. Braley, speaking at a January fund-raiser in Corpus Christi, Tex., was explaining why he should go to the Senate instead of his Republican opponent.
 America Rising, a conservative political action committee that has vowed to use videos and opposition research to attack Democratic candidates, posted the footage on YouTube on Tuesday. Other Republicans quickly criticized Mr. Braley.
 Though their numbers are declining, farmers are still a powerful force in the Iowa, which ranks second in the country in total farm sales. Mr. Braleyâ€™s apology noted his familyâ€™s history with Iowa agriculture, including his own stint â€œdoing farm jobs and working a grain elevator.â€\\x9d
 In another appeal to Iowa farmers, Joni Ernst, a candidate in the Republican Senate primary on June 3, announced in an ad that she grew up â€œcastrating hogs on an Iowa farm.â€\\x9d Ms. Ernst said that qualified her to â€œcut porkâ€\\x9d in Washington.

TITLE: GOP Staffer Apologizes For Lecturing Obama Daughters To 'Show A Little Class'

PUBLISHED: 2014/11/29

A Republican staffer on Friday apologized for a Facebook post that criticized Malia and Sasha Obama's appearance at the annual White House turkey pardon ceremony, one of America's silliest holiday traditions.
 Elizabeth Lauten, the communications director for Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.), wrote that the two teenagers should "try showing a little class," "dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar," and, most of all, "don't make faces" at Very Serious public events.
 Read the full rant via Gawker:
 Dear Sasha and Malia, I get youâ€™re both in those awful teen years, but youâ€™re a part of the First Family, try showing a little class. At least respect the part you play. Then again your mother and father donâ€™t respect their positions very much, or the nation for that matter, so Iâ€™m guessing youâ€™re coming up a little short in the â€˜good role modelâ€™ department. Nevertheless, stretch yourself. Rise to the occasion. Act like being in the White House matters to you. Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar. And certainly donâ€™t make faces during televised public events.
 The First Daughters join President Obama at the ceremony every year, where they can hardly contain their disdain for the lame dad jokes that predictably follow. Before approaching Mac and Cheese, the two turkeys, the president remarked that it was "puzzling that I do this every year." Malia even declined her father's offer to pet one of the pardoned turkeys with a nonchalant, "Nah."
 Lauten later apologized for rushing to judgment on Facebook.
 "I reacted to an article and quickly judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager," she said. "After many hours of prayer, talking to my parents and re-reading my words online, I can see more clearly how hurtful my words were. Please know that these judgmental feelings truly have no place in my heart. Furthermore, I'd like to apologize to all of those who I have hurt and offended with my words, and pledge to learn and grow (and I assure you I have) from this experience."

TITLE: GOP Congressman Expected To Be Indicted

PUBLISHED: 2014/04/25

Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.) is expected to be indicted by the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Grimm's lawyer said Friday.
 Politico was first to report the news of the expected indictment. Grimm's lawyer, William McGinley, said in a statement that the U.S. attorney's office "has disclosed its intent to file criminal charges."
 "We are disappointed by the governmentâ€™s decision, but hardly surprised," he said. "From the beginning, the government has pursued a politically driven vendetta against Congressman Grimm and not an independent search for the truth. Congressman Grimm asserts his innocence of any wrongdoing.
 "When the dust settles, he will be vindicated," McGinley added. "Until then, he will continue to serve his constituents with the same dedication and tenacity that has characterized his lifetime of public service as a Member of Congress, Marine Corps combat veteran, and decorated FBI Special Agent.â€\\x9d
 The New York Times reported the charges against Grimm "will include mail fraud and wire fraud and focus on his conduct in connection with a health food restaurant he owned on the Upper East Side of Manhattan after he left the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2006," citing someone familiar with the case.
 The Justice Department began investigating Grimm two years ago on allegations that he filed erroneous campaign finance reports and accepted improper donations during his first congressional campaign.
 More recently, Grimm was in the news in January after he physically threatened a reporter in the Capitol.
 The second-term congressman represents New Yorkâ€™s 11th District, which includes Staten Island and part of Brooklyn.
 The Washington Post reported that Grimm is likely to turn himself in once the indictment is unsealed.
 UPDATE: 7:19 p.m. -- The Washington Post now reports that Grimm has already "been secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in Brooklyn, according to people familiar with the case. The indictment is expected to be unsealed in the coming days."

TITLE: Top House Republican Hints At Immigration Principles

PUBLISHED: 2014/01/22

House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), a longtime target of immigration activists, said Tuesday that he would support allowing undocumented immigrants to stay in the U.S., but stopped short of calling for a path to citizenship.
 Advocates are hoping for a plan that would give undocumented immigrants a chance to both remain in the country and eventually become citizens, but House Republicans have indicated that the latter is something most cannot support. Although he's expressed openness to legal status previously, his comments could be a hint at what's to come in the House GOP's plan to soon release its own principles for immigration reform.
 "The principles aren't combined, written out yet, but in my personal belief I think it'll go with legal status that will allow you to work and pay your taxes," McCarthy told KBFX Eyewitnesses News. "But if you want to become a citizen, you'll have to go through the path. There won't be amnesty inside it."
 He added later, "That's a decision that every Republican will have to make in laying out the principles, but that's my personal position."
 McCarthy has previously been more open to immigration reform than many of his House Republican colleagues, and, as TPM notes, his district is 35 percent Latino. Immigration activists have targeted McCarthy specifically due to his high rank in the House GOP.

TITLE: G.O.P. Aide Quits After Ridiculing Obamaâ€™s Daughters, Sasha and Malia

PUBLISHED: 2014/12/01

WASHINGTON â€” A young Republican congressional aide resigned Monday after her Facebook post berating President Obamaâ€™s daughters for their attitude and outfits during the annual White House turkey pardon became a sensation on the Internet.
 On Friday, the aide, Elizabeth Lauten, 31, who has more than 14,000 followers on Twitter as @DCGopGirl and at the time was a spokeswoman for a little-known congressman from Tennessee, wrote an open letter to Sasha and Malia Obama on her Facebook page, saying they should â€œtry showing a little classâ€\\x9d and â€œdress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar.â€\\x9d
 By Monday, Ms. Lauten had resigned as communications director to Representative Stephen Fincher, a farmer and gospel singer perhaps best known for his whimsically named hometown, Frog Jump. Ms. Lauten, now a footnote in Mr. Fincherâ€™s career, is the latest cautionary tale about the dangers of social media sniping directed at the countryâ€™s most famous offspring.
 It started Wednesday with the most innocuous of events: the annual naming of the National Thanksgiving Turkey, when Mr. Obama officially liberated Cheese, a large white bird with impressive plumage, from the Thursday dinner table.
 Per tradition, the first daughters were in attendance, this time wearing mostly cheerless expressions and short outfits. Malia, 16, was dressed in a plaid miniskirt, sweater, dark tights and black hiking-style boots. Sasha, 13, wore a maroon dress, a cardigan sweater, a pair of white midcalf-high socks and black ankle boots.
 At times, the girls gazed glumly at the floor and threw an occasional eye roll at their father as he compared pardoning Cheese to granting amnesty to unauthorized immigrants. â€œYou want to pet him?â€\\x9d Mr. Obama asked his daughters.
 â€œNah,â€\\x9d Malia said quickly.
 Their teenage disdain drew its fair share of media attention, including a BuzzFeed article titled â€œThe Obama Girls Could Not Be More Bored by Their Dadâ€™s Jokes.â€\\x9d
 Enter Ms. Lauten â€” a former Republican National Committee new media aide who describes herself on Twitter as loving God, cats, the Daughters of the American Revolution â€œ& all things pink, green and pearls!â€\\x9d â€” whose commentary had a sharper edge.
 â€œI get youâ€™re both in those awful teen years, but youâ€™re a part of the First Family, try showing a little class,â€\\x9d she wrote above a picture of the unenthused Obama daughters. â€œAt least respect the part you play.â€\\x9d
 She went on to say that Malia and Sasha were â€œcoming up a little short in the â€˜good role modelâ€™ departmentâ€\\x9d because their parents â€œdonâ€™t respect their positions very much, or the nation for that matter.â€\\x9d
 Ms. Lauten wrote what she thought the daughters should have done: â€œRise to the occasion. Act like being in the White House matters to you. Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar.â€\\x9d
 Her views were widely circulated and eventually posted on Twitter by a reporter for The Root, a news, opinion and culture site aimed at African-American audiences. A flood of angry responses quickly followed.
 Ms. Lauten, who did not respond to repeated requests for further comment, later posted an apology for her â€œhurtfulâ€\\x9d words, saying she had â€œjudged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager.â€\\x9d
 Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Monday that he was â€œtaken aback that there was some political operative on Capitol Hill who did use the occasion of a Thanksgiving-themed event to criticize members of the first family.â€\\x9d
 Patti Davis, the daughter of Ronald Reagan, could relate. In a letter to Sasha and Malia posted on her website, Ms. Davis recalled being criticized by a reporter decades ago for the outfit she wore to a cocktail reception her parents held for Queen Elizabeth II when Mr. Reagan was president.
 â€œAs First Daughters, you canâ€™t win,â€\\x9d Ms. Davis wrote. â€œAnd while there isnâ€™t anything normal about the life you are living right now, you still can be.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Third-Highest Ranking Republican In U.S. House Calls For Legalizing Undocumented Immigrants

PUBLISHED: 2014/01/23

One of the highest-profile Republicans in the House of Representatives â€“ where national immigration reform will live or die this year â€“ said he agrees with giving undocumented immigrants a chance to legalize their status.
 Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, who is the third-ranking Republican in the House, made his comments in an interview with KBFX-TV in Bakersfield, Calif. just as his fellow GOP lawmakers are expected to unveil any day a set of â€œimmigration principlesâ€\\x9d that reportedly call for a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants.
 â€œThe principles arenâ€™t written yet, but in my personal belief, I think itâ€™ll go with legal status that will allow you to work and pay taxes,â€\\x9d he said. â€œBut if you want to become a citizen, youâ€™ll have to go through the path. There wonâ€™t be amnesty inside it.â€\\x9d
 McCarthyâ€™s district is roughly 35 percent Latino.
 The House Republican immigration principles reportedly will cover how the U.S. border should be protected, how immigration laws should be enforced inside the United States, and how many of the countryâ€™s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants can embark on a path to legalize their status, according to various media stories.
 The path to legalizationâ€™s inclusion in the plan â€“ which House Republican leaders discussed as recently as Wednesday -- is particularly significant given that it is one of the pivotal reasons that plans last year to pass a comprehensive immigration reform law broke down in the House of Representatives after it passed in the Senate in June.
 Conservative members of the Republicans in the House, where they hold a majority, had been adamant about not signing off on any measure that called for granting a pathway to legalization for people who are living in the country illegally. They maintain that that giving those immigrants any kind of break would amount to amnesty, or rewarding law-breakers.
 That created a fight among Republicans in Congress, with some â€“ including conservatives such as Sen. Marco Rubio, a Tea Party lawmaker from Florida â€“ arguing that deporting all 11 million undocumented immigrants was not a realistic option, and that not doing anything to bring them onto the radar amounted to an amnesty.
 Proponents of a pathway to legal status argued that the opportunity would be given only to those undocumented immigrants who earned it by meeting a strict set of criteria including paying fines, learning English, having a clean police record and paying taxes.
 Politico, a news site that covers politics, reported that House Speaker John Boehner, who is from Ohio, wants the plan, also referred to as â€œprinciples,â€\\x9d completed and made public before President Barack Obama delivers his State of the Union address on Jan. 28.
 The plan commits itself to the idea â€“ which is heavily favored by many Republicans â€“ that immigration reform will be handled in a piecemeal fashion, instead of comprehensively, as the Senate did.
 Obama told Senate Democrats this week that he believes that Boehner will make sure immigration reform is passed this year, according to The Hill, a a political publication in Washington, D.C.
 The president reportedly told the Democrats in a meeting that Republicans need to take action on immigration in order to keep the volatile issue from hurting their chances with Latino voters, as it appears to have done in 2012, when GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney did extremely poorly with the increasingly important voting bloc.
 Obama obtained three quarters of Latino votes cast in 2012, while Romney racked up 27 percent.
 Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, was quoted in The Hill as saying: â€œI think our Republican colleagues realize that to be blocking immigration reform is not good for them.â€\\x9d

In one of the highest-profile showdowns between establishment Republicans and Tea Party conservatives so far this year, Rep. Raul Labrador said Friday that he is challenging Rep. Kevin McCarthy for the House majority leader position that became open this week.
 Labrador, of Idaho, would be the Tea Party alternative to McCarthy, who is the whip and is favored by establishment Republicans. Only in Congress since 2010, Labrador would represent several firsts: the first Latino, first Mormon and first Idaho lawmaker to be House majority leader.
 Labradorâ€™s foray into the race for majority leader is yet another dramatic turn of events for Republicans, who were stunned by the defeat in Tuesdayâ€™s primary in Virginia of Rep. Eric Cantor to a Tea Party candidate who cast the congressman as someone who embraces the status quo of Beltway GOP politics and did not truly represent his constituents.
 Americans donâ€™t believe their leaders in Washington are listening and now is the time to change that.
 And it upends the June 19 voting by the House Republicans for majority leader. On Friday morning, McCarthy, 49, appeared to be headed toward running unopposed after some rivals dropped out.
 â€œI was stunned when Eric Cantor lost his primary election earlier this week,â€\\x9d Labrador, who is 46, said in his announcement about running for majority leader. â€œEric is a good friend and I have tremendous respect for him. But the message from Tuesday is clear â€“ Americans are looking for a change in the status quo.â€\\x9d
 Some conservatives in the House were pushing for a postponement of the June 19 election for majority leader, saying they wanted more time to put someone with more right-wing views in the running for the position.
 â€œI want aâ€¦leadership team that can bring the Republican conference together,â€\\x9d Labrador said in his statement, â€œA leadership team that can help unite and grow our party. Americans donâ€™t believe their leaders in Washington are listening and now is the time to change that.â€\\x9d
 Some lawmakers pressed Labrador to run, according to several published reports that quoted unnamed sources.
 Economics professor Dave Brat, the Tea Party candidate who defeated Cantor, attacked the congressman as soft on border security and on people who come here illegally.
 Cantor, who had once been more moderate on immigration issues â€“ particularly on the bitterly divisive aspect of whether to give undocumented immigrants already in the U.S. a chance to legalize their status â€“ shifted sharply to a hard line position, saying he would block any effort in the House to consider proposals to give such immigrants a break.
 But some observers said Cantorâ€™s tough stance toward the end of the primary â€“ one heâ€™d seemed confident heâ€™d easily win â€“ was too little too late.
 Others say it was Cantorâ€™s lack of popularity in general in his district, and his lackluster campaign, that doomed him.
 Nonetheless, many see the next majority leader as potentially influencing the House handling of immigration reform, which stalled as conservative members said they would not support a comprehensive measure for an overhaul of the system, and especially not one that, in their view, would grant amnesty to lawbreakers.
 The Senate last year passed a sweeping bipartisan immigration reform bill that both tightened border security and provided a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants who meet a strict set of criteria.
 McCarthy, whose district is 35 percent Latino, has expressed support for providing a path to legal status, but only after those applying for it earn it by learning English and paying fines and taxes, among other things.
 Labrador, who worked as an immigration attorney before serving in Congress, was part of a bipartisan group in the House that was working on a reform bill. But Labrador famously quit the group because of a disagreement with its other members over whether to entitle undocumented immigrants to some form of healthcare.
 Labrador has not been shy about criticizing House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, saying that he should step down if he allows a vote on an immigration bill this year. The Idaho congressman, echoing other conservatives, has said that Congress should wait until at least 2015 to take up the issue again because President Obama must make a clear attempt to take steps to secure the borders and step up interior enforcement of immigration laws.
 He has said he will not back a version of the Senate reform bill, and prefers to deal with the subject in a piecemeal fashion. Labrador supports a path to legal status, but only after evidence that enforcement has been improved, he has said. He also supports expanding foreign worker visa programs.
 Labrador says this about himself on his website: â€œBorn to a single mother in Puerto Rico, RaÃºl Labrador moved with his mother to the mainland U.S. at age 13.â€\\x9d
 â€œHis mother worked many different jobs to make ends meet,â€\\x9d it says. â€œThough times were tough, RaÃºlâ€™s mother often reminded him that if he studied, worked hard, and played by the rules, he could achieve the American Dream. This encouraged RaÃºl to never give up on his professional aspirations and personal dreams.â€\\x9d
 One of the conservative members in the House who wanted to postpone the June 19 vote for majority leader quickly indicated that for him, Labrador would not do.
 Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), tweeted on Friday "#Labrador is pro amnesty. If not this year, he has strongly advocated for amnesty next year. No fair trying to redefine amnesty.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Eric Cantor Defeated by David Brat, Tea Party Challenger, in G.O.P. Primary Upset

PUBLISHED: 2014/06/12

WASHINGTON â€” In one of the most stunning primary election upsets in congressional history, the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, was soundly defeated on Tuesday by a Tea Party-backed economics professor who had hammered him for being insufficiently conservative.
 The result delivered a major jolt to the Republican Party â€” Mr. Cantor had widely been considered the top candidate to succeed Speaker John A. Boehner â€” and it has the potential to change both the debate in Washington on immigration and, possibly, the midterm elections.
 With just over $200,000, David Brat, a professor at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Va., toppled Mr. Cantor, repeatedly criticizing him for being soft on immigration and contending that he supported what critics call amnesty for immigrants in the country illegally.
 During a short concession speech late Tuesday, Mr. Cantor did not try to analyze his defeat or cast blame, saying only that he knew he had disappointed his supporters.
 In victory, Mr. Brat said that his candidacy had resonated with voters who believed that politics had been dumbed down by partisan infighting.
 â€œThe American people want to pay attention to serious ideas again,â€\\x9d Mr. Brat said, speaking on Fox News. â€œOur founding was built by people who were political philosophers, and we need to get back to that, away from this kind of cheap political rhetoric of right and left.â€\\x9d He will face Jack Trammell, a Democrat who is also a professor at Randolph-Macon, this fall in the heavily Republican district.
 Republicans were so sure that Mr. Cantor would win that most party leaders had been watching for how broad his victory would be. His defeat will reverberate in the capital and could have major implications for any chance of an immigration overhaul.
 Mr. Cantor, 51, who is in his seventh term, had sought to counter Mr. Bratâ€™s accusations that he was too willing to compromise on immigration. The majority leader, who had raised $5.4 million for the campaign, blanketed Virginiaâ€™s Seventh Congressional District with fliers and television advertisements in which he emphasized that he opposed an â€œamnestyâ€\\x9d policy.
 But with significant help from conservative talk radio hosts like Laura Ingraham, Mr. Brat was able to galvanize opposition to Mr. Cantor in one of Virginiaâ€™s most conservative congressional districts.
 Ms. Ingraham, one of the few high-profile conservatives to put her muscle behind Mr. Brat, said on Fox News on Tuesday night that the primary results were â€œan absolute repudiation of establishment politicsâ€\\x9d and that Republican leaders should take note.
 â€œHe really just didnâ€™t have very much money, but what he did have was a lot of heart,â€\\x9d she said of Mr. Brat. â€œI think there will be a lot of people out there saying this could be the beginning of something really big for the Republican Party.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Cantorâ€™s loss recalled the defeat of former Speaker Thomas S. Foley, a Democrat who lost to a little-known Republican, George Nethercutt, in the 1994 general elections that delivered control of Congress to the Republicans. It is much rarer for a member of the congressional leadership to lose a primary.
 Mr. Brat had little help from national groups that have funded other Tea Party challengers. Instead, he relied mostly on state and local activists.
 Larry Nordvig, executive director of the Richmond Tea Party, said the national groups were not aware of â€œhow much activity was going on underneath the surface down here and how large the ABC â€” Anybody But Cantor â€” mentality was.â€\\x9d
 In a February interview, Mr. Brat spoke of the difficulty he had in rounding up conservative support despite meeting with powerful groups and donors to try to convince them that he was worth the investment. â€œI met with all of them,â€\\x9d he said. â€œBut itâ€™s tough. Everybody just wants to see the polls, how much money youâ€™ve raised. But they do not know whatâ€™s going on on the ground.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Cantor had won primaries in his district, which stretches from Richmond to the Washington suburbs, with as much as 79 percent of the vote, and he won the general election race for a seventh term in 2012 with 58 percent.
 Within the Republican Party, he was seen as a star, with the ability to tap into the energy of the Houseâ€™s more conservative members while at the same time not alienating the partyâ€™s establishment wing.
 In the House, his relationship with Mr. Boehner reflected some of the larger tensions within the party. Mr. Cantor was strongly opposed, for instance, to the so-called grand bargain negotiations on the budget between the speaker and President Obama.
 Mr. Boehner said Tuesday that he and Mr. Cantor had â€œbeen through a lot together,â€\\x9d making â€œtough choices that come with governing.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Cantor received what amounted to a warning shot from local Republicans at a district convention last month in Henrico County, his political home base, when conservatives ousted one of his loyalists as Republican chairman while he looked on.
 Yet he seemed to recognize the seriousness of the threat only in the final weeks of the campaign, when he suddenly shifted his advertising and began sending aides from Washington to his district. At that point, it was too late to stave off defeat.
 â€œThere are some very angry people upset with the status quo, and Eric became part of that,â€\\x9d said former Representative Thomas M. Davis III, a Virginia Republican. â€œHe was the only conduit they have to express their anger right now. And when Eric Cantor, a conservative and member of the leadership, is too moderate, it sends a chilling effect to other Republicans and makes it that much harder to cross over and work together.â€\\x9d
 As for the prospects of an immigration overhaul now, Mr. Davis said: â€œHow do you get that or anything done now? Eric is too liberal? This was the guy holding Boehner back.â€\\x9d
 Many voters also perceived Mr. Cantor as ignoring district concerns as he sought to raise his national profile. He kept a home in suburban Richmond and sent his children to school there, but he spent much of his time in recent years traveling across the country to raise money and campaign for Republican candidates.
 It was all part of his ambition to become speaker of the House, having begun his career as the driver to his predecessor, Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr. Reaching that pinnacle had, of late, seemed as close as ever, with Washington full of speculation that Mr. Boehner would soon retire.
 â€œIâ€™m in shock,â€\\x9d said Representative Patrick T. McHenry, Republican of North Carolina.
 Congressional Democrats were ecstatic, and so stunned by Mr. Cantorâ€™s loss that many admitted they did not even know who the Democratic challenger was.
 An informal dinner party at the Georgetown apartment of Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, turned into a celebration.
 â€œI never thought Iâ€™d see the day that Eric Cantor would be losing his primary,â€\\x9d said Representative Louise M. Slaughter of New York, the senior Democrat on the House Rules Committee.
 Ms. Pelosi said, â€œI still canâ€™t even believe it.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Federal prosecutors subpoena Christie's campaign, NJ GOP committee

PUBLISHED: 2014/01/23

Federal prosecutors have subpoenaed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's campaign and a state Republican Party committee, escalating their probe into allegations that his aides created traffic jams as political payback.
 Mark Sheridan, the attorney representing Christie's campaign, confirmed to Fox News that the campaign and the Republican State Committee received subpoenas relating to the closure of traffic lanes near the George Washington Bridge last year.
 "We can confirm that the Christie for Governor re-election campaign and the New Jersey Republican State Committee received subpoenas for documents from the U.S. Attorney's office, in addition to the subpoena the campaign previously received from the state legislative committee," he said. "All three subpoenas focus on the closure of lanes on the George Washington Bridge. The campaign and the state party intend to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney's office and the state legislative committee and will respond to the subpoenas accordingly."
 The subpoenas were disclosed Thursday, the same day the Republican governor's campaign announced it had hired the Washington, D.C., law firm Patton Boggs in the case. Sheridan works for the firm and is general counsel for the state Republican committee.
 A state legislative committee investigating the traffic jams has also issued subpoenas to the two organizations.
 The federal subpoenas are due Feb. 5. The state committee subpoenas must be returned Feb. 3.
 Earlier this month, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said only that his office was reviewing the matter "to determine whether a federal law was implicated."
 The traffic lanes were closed for four days in September, creating traffic gridlock in Fort Lee, the town at the base of the bridge on the New Jersey side. Emails and text messages turned over to legislators suggest it may have been a message to the town's Democratic mayor for not endorsing Christie.

TITLE: Indictment Expected for Grimm, Staten Island Congressman

PUBLISHED: 2014/04/25

Representative Michael G. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent and Marine who capitalized on his straight-arrow image to win a seat in Congress, was expected to be indicted on federal fraud charges after a lengthy corruption investigation, people with knowledge of the case said on Friday.
 The charges against Mr. Grimm, 44, a Republican who was first elected in 2010 and represents Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, were expected to include mail fraud and wire fraud, and to focus largely on his conduct in connection with a health food restaurant he owned on the Upper East Side of Manhattan after he left the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2006, two of the people said. He was also expected to be charged with obstruction of justice, for allegedly lying under oath in a federal lawsuit.
 The investigation of the second-term congressman, by the F.B.I. and the United States attorneyâ€™s office in Brooklyn, began more than two years ago with an examination of Mr. Grimmâ€™s fund-raising for his 2010 race and expanded. Two of his fund-raisers have already been charged. One, Diana Durand of Houston, was charged with illegally funneling more than $10,000 into his campaign. The other, Ofer Biton, pleaded guilty to visa fraud charges.
 But on Friday, it did not appear that the indictment would include any campaign finance charges or accusations that the congressman had misused his office, although several of the people noted that the investigation was continuing. They all spoke on the condition of anonymity as the charges had not been formally announced and they were not authorized to discuss the case.
 A lawyer for Mr. Grimm, William McGinley of Patton Boggs, confirmed in a statement that prosecutors intended to file criminal charges against his client and said that Mr. Grimm â€œasserts his innocenceâ€\\x9d and that the investigation was â€œa politically driven vendetta.â€\\x9d
 â€œAfter more than two years of investigation plagued by malicious leaks, violations of grand jury secrecy and strong-arm tactics, the U.S. attorneyâ€™s office has disclosed its intent to file criminal charges against Congressman Grimm,â€\\x9d Mr. McGinley said. â€œWhen the dust settles, he will be vindicated. Until then, he will continue to serve his constituents with the same dedication and tenacity that has characterized his lifetime of public service as a member of Congress, Marine Corps combat veteran and decorated F.B.I. special agent.â€\\x9d
 Spokesmen for the office of the United States attorney in Brooklyn, Loretta E. Lynch, and for the New York F.B.I. office declined to comment.
 Mr. Grimm, the only Republican member of New York Cityâ€™s congressional delegation, is up for re-election in November and faces a potentially formidable challenger in former City Councilman Domenic M. Recchia Jr., a Democrat who headed the Councilâ€™s Finance Committee and was Christine C. Quinnâ€™s chief lieutenant when she was Council speaker. Healthalicious, the restaurant that the people said was a focus of the indictment, was on Second Avenue near 83rd Street. The company Mr. Grimm formed to operate it was called Granny Sayz, L.L.C., and was affiliated with a company connected to Mr. Biton, the fund-raiser.
 In January 2012, the New York State Workersâ€™ Compensation Board ordered Healthalicious to pay $88,000 for not carrying workersâ€™ compensation insurance. About a year earlier, two former deliverymen hired a lawyer who contacted Mr. Grimmâ€™s congressional office to complain that the restaurant had paid them less than minimum wage, did not pay for work beyond 40 hours per week and paid them in cash to evade scrutiny. Shortly afterward, Mr. Grimm filed papers with the state to dissolve Granny Sayz. The lawyer eventually sued Granny Sayz in federal court.
 Mr. Grimm over time developed something of a reputation for being hot-tempered, which did not set him apart from many others in Congress. But this year, during an encounter with a television reporter, he set a new standard for on-air congressional misbehavior and delivered a bizarre threat.
 After President Obamaâ€™s State of the Union address, NY1â€™s Washington reporter, Michael Scotto, interviewed the congressman about the speech. When he asked about the federal campaign financing investigation, Mr. Grimm stormed off camera but returned and threatened to throw Mr. Scotto off the balcony. Then, the congressman, speaking in a barely audible whisper as he stood close to the reporter, said Mr. Scotto was â€œnot man enoughâ€\\x9d and added: â€œIâ€™ll break you in half. Like a boy.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Nebraska and Oklahoma Sue Colorado Over Marijuana Law

PUBLISHED: 2014/12/18

DENVER â€” Two heartland states filed the first major court challenge to marijuana legalization on Thursday, saying that Coloradoâ€™s growing array of state-regulated recreational marijuana shops was piping marijuana into neighboring states and should be shut down.
 The lawsuit was brought by attorneys general in Nebraska and Oklahoma, and asks the United States Supreme Court to strike down key parts of a 2012 voter-approved measure that legalized marijuana in Colorado for adult use and created a new system of stores, taxes and regulations surrounding retail marijuana.
 While marijuana remains illegal under federal law, officials have largely allowed Colorado and other states to move ahead with state-run programs allowing medical and recreational marijuana. But the lawsuit from Nebraska and Oklahoma, where marijuana is still outlawed, argues that Colorado has â€œcreated a dangerous gapâ€\\x9d in the federal drug-control system.
 â€œMarijuana flows from this gap into neighboring states,â€\\x9d the suit says, undermining their marijuana bans, â€œdraining their treasuries, and placing stress on their criminal justice systems.â€\\x9d
 For months, some sheriffs and police officers in rural counties bordering Colorado have complained that they have seen more marijuana entering their towns and being transported down their highways since recreational sales began in January. Oklahoma and Nebraska said the influx had led to more arrests, more impounded vehicles and higher jail and court costs. They say it has also forced law-enforcement agencies to spend more time and dedicate more resources to handling marijuana-related arrests.
 â€œWeâ€™re seeing a lot of marijuana coming over from Colorado,â€\\x9d said Sheriff Adam Hayward of Deuel County, Neb., who said that he was gratified that the two states were challenging Coloradoâ€™s marijuana laws. He has complained that marijuana arrests have strained his jail budget. â€œFor the longest time we were saying, this is becoming a problem for us.â€\\x9d
 Coloradoâ€™s attorney general, John Suthers, a Republican, said in a statement that the challenge from Nebraska and Oklahoma was â€œwithout merit.â€\\x9d Like many elected officials in Colorado, Mr. Suthers had opposed Amendment 64, which legalized marijuana. But on Thursday, he said â€œwe will vigorously defendâ€\\x9d against the lawsuit attempting to undo it.
 Nebraska and Oklahomaâ€™s challenge is aimed more at the commercial side of marijuana legalization, which created new systems of regulations and taxes as well as recreational stores, dispensaries and production facilities that are monitored and licensed by state officials. The suit does not specifically seek to overturn the portion of Amendment 64 that made marijuana legal for personal use and possession, meaning that portions of legalization could survive even if Nebraska and Oklahoma prevail.
 But marijuana advocates said that the challenge â€” if it succeeds at shutting down marijuana retailers â€” could boost the black market.
 â€œIf Nebraska and Oklahoma succeed, they will put the violent criminal organizations back in charge,â€\\x9d Michael Elliott, the executive director of the Marijuana Industry Group, a Colorado-based trade group, said in a statement.
 The lawsuit, which was brought by Nebraskaâ€™s attorney general, Jon Bruning, and Oklahomaâ€™s attorney general, Scott Pruitt, accused Colorado officials of participating in a â€œschemeâ€\\x9d that cultivates, packages and distributes marijuana in direct violation of controlled-substances laws while â€œignoring every objective embodied in the federal drug control regulation.â€\\x9d It was filed directly with the Supreme Court because it involves a dispute among states.
 â€œThe Constitution and the federal antidrug laws do not permit the development of a patchwork of state and local pro-drug policies and licensed distribution schemes throughout the country,â€\\x9d the lawsuit says.
 Nebraska and Oklahoma accused Colorado of leaving huge holes in marijuana rules that allowed the plant to flow out of state.
 While it is against the law to take legally purchased marijuana across state lines, Nebraska and Oklahoma said that Colorado does not require consumers to smoke or eat their marijuana where they buy it, and said that despite purchasing and possession limits, anyone can easily visit several dispensaries and stock up. Some sheriffs in bordering states say they have pulled over drivers and found edibles and marijuana from multiple Colorado retail outlets.
 They also criticized Colorado for not tracking marijuana once it is sold, and for not requiring marijuana buyers to undergo criminal background checks (under Colorado law, anyone 21 or older can legally purchase recreational marijuana). Coloradoâ€™s rules have no way to prevent â€œcriminal enterprises, gangs and cartels from acquiring marijuana inventory directly from retail marijuana stores,â€\\x9d the lawsuit says.
 Nebraska and Oklahoma complained about a â€œsignificant influx of Colorado-sourced marijuana,â€\\x9d but the suit did not mention specific statistics about Colorado-related marijuana arrests or drug seizures. In earlier interviews, some local law-enforcement officers along Coloradoâ€™s borders said that they had not seen an increase in marijuana coming from Colorado.

TITLE: Man Who Defeated Cantor Calls His Big Win 'A Miracle'

PUBLISHED: 2014/06/10

Dave Brat celebrated his stunning victory over House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) for the Republican nomination on Tuesday night in a phone interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity.
 The tea party-backed candidate attributed his victory to God and to grassroots efforts, calling the win a "miracle."
 "If you go door to door knocking, the American people know the country is headed in the wrong direction," Brat said. "I attribute [the win] to God... God acted through the people on my behalf."
 Cantor was expected to defeat Brat by a wide margin, outraising the college professor $5.4 million to $200,000. But Brat unseated the House majority leader with 56 percent of the vote.
 "The good news is dollars don't vote, people do," Brat told Hannity. "I think the people are just ready for some major changes in this country."
 Brat shied away from explicitly identifying as a tea party candidate, saying he ran on Republican principles.
 "I'm not holding anyone's feet to the fire but it wasn't a contest between the tea party and the Republicans and all this," he said. "Although I have tremendous tea party support and just wonderful people in the tea party and grassroots helping me out, and they're clearly responsible for the win... I ran on the Republican principles."
 "I've been a conservative my whole life," he added. "There's nothing hard right or far right about anything. I just believe in the ideas and that ideas matter in history."

TITLE: Governor of Arizona Is Pressed to Veto Bill

PUBLISHED: 2014/02/24

PHOENIX â€” As the Arizona Legislature sent a bill to her desk Monday that would grant business owners the right to invoke religion to refuse service to gays and others, Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, faced pressure from many corners to veto the measure, which has cast unwanted national attention on Arizona.
 Elected officials, civic leaders and business groups spoke out publicly against the measure, which passed both houses of the Legislature on Thursday.
 On Twitter, Arizonaâ€™s United States senators, John McCain and Jeff Flake, also Republicans, had nearly identical posts, with both of them saying they hoped Ms. Brewer would veto the bill. An executive from Apple Inc., which plans to build a big manufacturing plant in Mesa, called Ms. Brewer to urge her to reject it, and W. Douglas Parker, chairman and chief executive of American Airlines, sent her a letter citing the stateâ€™s â€œeconomic comebackâ€\\x9d and saying, â€œThere is genuine concern throughout the business community that this bill, if signed into law, would jeopardize all that has been accomplished so far.â€\\x9d
 Their calls were echoed by three Republican state senators â€” Adam Driggs, Steve Pierce and Bob Worsley, all members of the partyâ€™s conservative camp â€” who had helped pass the legislation in the first place. â€œWhile our sincere intent in voting for this bill was to create a shield for all citizensâ€™ religious liberties, the bill has instead been mischaracterized by its opponents as a sword of religious intolerance,â€\\x9d the senators said in a letter to Ms. Brewer, adding that the matter was â€œcausing our state immeasurable harm.â€\\x9d
 The billâ€™s remaining supporters took to the airwaves and the Internet to defend it. Cathi Herrod, president of the Center for Arizona Policy, an architect of the bill, issued a news release calling attacks on the legislation â€œpolitics at its absolute worse,â€\\x9d and saying, â€œInstead of having an honest discussion about the true meaning of religious liberty, opponents of the bill have hijacked this discussion through lies, personal attacks, and irresponsible reporting.â€\\x9d
 Ms. Brewer was in Washington on Monday but was scheduled to return Tuesday to Phoenix, where she will have until the end of the week to act on the bill. Her spokesman, Andrew Wilder, suggested that she would not take that long, but he would not say what she was inclined to do.
 The religion bill comes as Arizona prepares to host the Super Bowl next year and struggles to regain its economic vitality. From Washington on Monday, Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware, a Democrat, told Ronan Farrow of MSNBC that if Ms. Brewer signs the measure, â€œthe N.F.L. may be looking, or maybe should be looking, to move the Super Bowl out of the state.â€\\x9d
 And Barry Broome, president and chief executive of the Greater Phoenix Economic Council, said that leaders of four companies looking to relocate to Arizona had put his organization on notice, saying they might reconsider if the bill became law. The stateâ€™s image is still scarred by a divisive immigration law passed in 2010, which gave police officers the ability to stop people whom they suspected of being in the country illegally, and triggered widespread boycotts.
 Among the Republicans vying to succeed Ms. Brewer, who cannot run for re-election because of term limits, there was broad consensus against the measure, which would expand the stateâ€™s definition of â€œexercise of religionâ€\\x9d to protect businesses and citizens from lawsuits after denying services on religious grounds.
 One candidate, Scott Smith, the mayor of Mesa, who is a Mormon, said that the bill â€œgives carte blanche for anybody to discriminate under the guise of religion.â€\\x9d Another candidate, Doug Ducey, the state treasurer, qualified his view, saying that he would veto the bill but then â€œbring together all the interested parties before this legislative session adjourns to forge consensus on acceptable language protecting religious liberty.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Wilder, the governorâ€™s spokesman, said Ms. Brewerâ€™s office had received more than 10,000 calls and emails on the matter as of Monday morning.

TITLE: Federal prosecutors plan to file charges against Rep. Grimm, attorney says

PUBLISHED: 2014/04/25

New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm's attorney confirmed late Friday that federal prosecutors plan to file criminal charges against the congressman.
 The decision follows a two-year FBI investigation into various aspects of Grimm's business and campaign history.
 "We are disappointed by the government's decision, but hardly surprised," said the statement from Grimm's attorney, William McGinley. "From the beginning, the government has pursued a politically driven vendetta against Congressman Grimm and not an independent search for the truth."
 The statement said Grimm "asserts his innocence of any wrongdoing" and "will be vindicated."
 "Until then, he will continue to serve his constituents with the same dedication and tenacity that has characterized his lifetime of public service as a Member of Congress, Marine Corps combat veteran, and decorated FBI Special Agent," the statement said.
 The House Ethics Committee announced in November that Grimm was under investigation for possible campaign finance violations. That committee said it would defer its inquiry because of a separate Department of Justice investigation.
 A spokesman for the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn said he could not confirm, deny or comment on the case.
 Grimm made headlines in January after confronting a New York City cable news station reporter who tried to question him about a long-running FBI investigation into campaign finance on a balcony in the Capitol.
 After reporter Michael Scotto finished his report, Grimm stormed back, leaned into him and said, "Let me be clear to you. If you ever do that to me again, I'll throw you off this (expletive) balcony."
 Scotto, who was asking about fundraising during Grimm's first campaign, protested, saying he was asking "a valid question."
 During that race, Grimm has acknowledged receiving $250,000 to $300,000 in contributions from followers of an Israeli rabbi, Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto. Some members of Pinto's congregation subsequently said they made tens of thousands of dollars in illegal contributions, including gifts passed through straw donors.
 Grimm has denied knowledge of any improprieties, and the FBI hasn't accused him of any wrongdoing. The Israeli businessman who had served as Grimm's liaison to Pinto's followers, Ofer Biton, pleaded guilty in August to an immigration fraud charge.
 Three days after that guilty plea, the FBI filed a sealed criminal complaint accusing a Houston woman who had been romantically involved with Grimm of using straw donors to make illegal campaign contributions.
 In that case, made public this month, the woman was accused of funneling at least $10,000 to Grimm's campaign by passing them through friends who agreed to have the donations listed under their names.
 A spokesman in Grimm's Washington office, Nick Iacono, did not immediately return emails or a telephone message seeking comment Friday.

TITLE: House Republicans to Offer Broad Immigration Plan

PUBLISHED: 2014/01/25

WASHINGTON â€” House Republicans are preparing to unveil their own broad template for overhauling the nationâ€™s immigration system this week, potentially offering a small opening for President Obama and congressional Democrats to pass bipartisan legislation before the end of the year.
 Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and other Republican leaders are expected to release a one-page statement of immigration principles this week at their annual retreat in Cambridge, Md., according to aides with knowledge of the plan. The document is expected to call for border security and enforcement measures, as well as providing a path to legal status â€” but not citizenship â€” for many of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, the aides said.
 The Republican effort comes as Mr. Obama is expected to push once again for an overhaul of the immigration system in his State of the Union address Tuesday, and as lawmakers from both parties describe immigration as one of the few potential areas for bipartisan compromise before the end of the current Congress.
 â€œThe principles they lay out Iâ€™m sure wonâ€™t satisfy everybody,â€\\x9d Michael R. Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City, said at an immigration forum on Friday. But, he added, â€œif we can make some compromises here for the good of the country, I think we have a very good chance for the first time in a long time of changing something that is really damaging all of us.â€\\x9d
 The Senate, led by Democrats, passed a broad bipartisan measure in June to overhaul immigration that included a 13-year path to citizenship. But the legislation stalled in the Republican-controlled House, where some of the partyâ€™s more conservative members oppose any form of legal status as â€œamnesty.â€\\x9d
 But heading into the three-day Republican retreat, even some of the most ardent conservatives say consensus is forming around an immigration package that would include several separate bills on border security; a clampdown against the hiring of undocumented workers; expanded guest-worker programs; a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants brought to the country as children; and a path to legal status for undocumented workers with family ties to citizens or employer sponsors.
 The White House has said it wants a path to citizenship for both children and adults in any new immigration legislation.
 â€œThe presidentâ€™s pathway to citizenship is a stumbling block,â€\\x9d said Representative Andy Harris, a conservative Republican who represents the Maryland district that will host the retreat. â€œBut legalization with no path to citizenship can gain some votes.â€\\x9d
 Representative Peter T. King, a Republican of New York and a longtime critic of proposals to change the immigration system, said it was significant that both the third-ranking Republican in the House, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, and the Judiciary Committee chairman, Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, had voiced support in recent days for legal status for some immigrants living in the country illegally â€” and have taken very little heat for their remarks on either side of the aisle.
 But the divisions that have slowed progress in the House have not been entirely mended. Representative RaÃºl R. Labrador, a Republican of Idaho and once a leading immigration negotiator in the House, said it would be a mistake to push forward.
 â€œThe president has shown heâ€™s not willing to work with us on immigration,â€\\x9d Mr. Labrador said. â€œItâ€™s not worth having a party divided when we have so many issues we can come together on.â€\\x9d
 On Thursday, aides to House conservatives who oppose the leadershipâ€™s plan gathered in the office of Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and a fierce opponent of the immigration push, to plot a strategy to torpedo it.
 Critics worry that House Republican leaders and Senate Democrats are essentially negotiating a final deal, bypassing formal House-Senate negotiations, where conservatives had hoped to derail the process. Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, one of the Democratic architects of the Senate bill, said: â€œOne thing is certain, just as with the budget, at some point both the House and the Senate will have to sit down and resolve all the contentious issues.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Holder says he understands mistrust of police as Ferguson protests dwindle

PUBLISHED: 2014/08/21

Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday that he understands why many black Americans distrust the police as he made a one-day swing through the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Mo., where a black teenager was fatally shot by a white police officer almost two weeks earlier.
 Holder made the comments during a meeting with about 50 community leaders at the Florissant campus of St. Louis Community College in which he heard about their own issues with law enforcement officials.
 Ferguson has endured more than a week of unrest since the August 9 death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was shot by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson. The Obama administration intended the trip to underscore its commitment to civil rights in general and the Ferguson case in particular.
 "I understand that mistrust," Holder said. "I am the attorney general of the United States. But I am also a black man." The attorney general then described how he was stopped twice on the New Jersey Turnpike and accused of speeding. Police searched his car, going through the trunk and looking under the seats.
 "I remember how humiliating that was and how angry I was and the impact it had on me," Holder said.
 Holder also described how once, while living in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, he was running to catch a movie with his cousin when a squad car rolled up and flashed its lights at the pair. The officer yelled, "Where are you going? Hold it!" Holder recalled.
 His cousin "started mouthing off," and Holder urged him to be quiet.
 "We negotiate the whole thing, and we walk to our movie. At the time that he stopped me, I was a federal prosecutor. I wasn't a kid," he said.
 While in Ferguson, Holder met with federal officials investigating the case, as well as Brown's parents. He also met with Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who has been in charge of security in Ferguson for nearly a week. The National Guard is also helping to keep the peace.
 On Wednesday night, a diminished number of protesters marched around a single block in Ferguson as a thunderstorm filled the sky with lighting and dumped rain. Police still stood guard, but many wore regular uniforms rather than riot gear.
 Johnson said there were six arrests Wednesday, compared to 47 the previous night. He called it "a very good night," and said Holder's visit had let people know their voices had been heard.
 In nearby Clayton, a grand jury began hearing evidence to determine whether Wilson should be charged in Brown's death. A spokesman for St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch said there was no timeline for the process, but it could take weeks.
 Outside the St. Louis County Justice Center, where the grand jury convened, two dozen protesters gathered in a circle for a prayer, chanted and held signs urging McCulloch to step aside.
 McCulloch's deep family connections to police have been cited by some black leaders who question his ability to be impartial in the case. McCulloch's father, mother, brother, uncle and cousin all worked for the St. Louis Police Department, and his father was killed while responding to a call involving a black suspect.
 The prosecutor, who is white, has insisted his background will have no bearing on the handling of the Brown case, which has touched off days of nighttime protests during which authorities used tear gas and rubber bullets to clear the streets.
 On Wednesday, police said an officer had been suspended for pointing a semi-automatic assault rifle at demonstrators, then cursing and threatening to kill one of them. A protester captured the exchange on video Tuesday and posted it to YouTube and other websites.

TITLE: 

PUBLISHED: 2014/06/14

WASHINGTON â€” Representative RaÃºl R. Labrador, a Republican of Idaho who has barely served two terms in Congress, jumped into the race for House majority leader on Friday, offering himself as the more conservative alternative who could pull the House rightward in the wake of Representative Eric Cantorâ€™s loss in a primary.
 â€œThe message from Tuesday is clear â€” Americans are looking for a change in the status quo,â€\\x9d Mr. Labrador, a former immigration lawyer elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010, said in a statement. â€œPresident Obama and the Democrats have had their chance and they have failed. Republicans must be willing to take these challenges head on with new leadership, fresh ideas and a different approach.â€\\x9d
 While some of those conservative lawmakers elected in 2010 were hoping that the House leadership elections on Thursday would offer them the chance to reclaim their influence on Capitol Hill, few of them give Mr. Labrador much of a chance against the current House majority whip, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California. Though Tea Party activists provided the energy and votes for Mr. Cantorâ€™s ouster, the elections might be more of a plea for a place at the leadership table.
 Supporters of Mr. McCarthy, who confidently traveled home to his district in Bakersfield for the weekend, said Friday that the Californian had all but sewed up the votes he needs.
 â€œWe have got to have an alternative,â€\\x9d Representative Louie Gohmert, Republican of Texas, said on Glenn Beckâ€™s conservative radio show. â€œI mean, for us as a party in Congress to send the message that we didnâ€™t learn a blessed thing from this amazing election result, we arenâ€™t paying attention.â€\\x9d
 House conservatives â€” lacking a rationale to fight Mr. McCarthy, a well-liked member of leadership who has raised millions of dollars for Republican incumbents â€” have begun protesting that his voting record is actually to the left of Mr. Cantorâ€™s.
 FreedomWorks, which has provided financial support for Tea Party candidates, immediately began trying to generate support for Mr. Labrador through its websites and email lists. â€œNow that grass-roots conservatives FIRED Eric Cantor, we need a new majority leader in the House of Representatives,â€\\x9d FreedomWorksâ€™ website said Friday.
 Matt Kibbe, the groupâ€™s president and chief executive, said that he did not have great qualms with Mr. McCarthyâ€™s ideology, but that he was more about politics than ideas. â€œThe Republican penchant for just choosing the next guy in line hasnâ€™t proven to be a great strategy, and it hasnâ€™t picked good leadership,â€\\x9d Mr. Kibbe said.
 But Mr. Labradorâ€™s path to victory is steep, especially in the few days before House Republicans gather to elect Mr. Cantorâ€™s replacement. Mr. McCarthy has been preparing for months to move up from No. 3 in the Republican leadership to No. 2 in the event that Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio would retire after the November elections.
 Conservative Republicans in the House pleaded Friday for a delay in the voting. Some grumbled that the campaign by the college professor David Brat to unseat Mr. Cantor had ousted the one member of House Republican leadership willing to listen to the Houseâ€™s most conservative members. Instead, the House will end up elevating a leader with a less conservative record and less patience for the far-right flank.
 For his part, Mr. Boehner has remained firm that he wanted to get it done quickly and minimize disruption.
 Mr. McCarthy spent much of the day calling members and shoring up support, said a Republican aide close to the majority whip. McCarthy supporters predicted that Mr. Labrador would muster no more than a few dozen votes.
 Some lawmakers questioned whether his run was really a quest to win the majority leaderâ€™s post or merely to raise his own profile. His decision to jump in was widely seen as proof that more experienced conservative members, like Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio or Tom Price of Georgia, had rebuffed overtures to run from other conservatives.
 Tea Party groups off Capitol Hill may believe Mr. Labrador can win, and they will pressure House conservatives to join the campaign. But ultimately, supporting him could hurt more conservative members with the House leadership.
 Mr. Labrador tried on Friday to at least engage the Republican conference in a debate over ideas. He said the party needed to address issues like upward income mobility among the poor and middle-class economic insecurity. Born the son of a single mother in Puerto Rico, he has seen himself as an ambassador to young and minority voters out of reach to traditional Republicans.
 â€œI am running for majority leader because I want to help create a vision of growth and opportunity for everyone and start getting to work for the American people,â€\\x9d he said.
 Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, rushed to champion Mr. Labradorâ€™s candidacy. Mr. Amash, after all, voted last year to make him speaker of the House.
 â€œWe canâ€™t respond to a stunning loss by giving a pat on the back and promotion to the same team,â€\\x9d Mr. Amash said of Mr. Cantorâ€™s defeat. â€œItâ€™s time for someone new, someone conservative, someone who will put forward a fresh agenda, and someone we know is a proven and talented spokesman. That man is RaÃºl Labrador.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Nebraska, Oklahoma File Federal Suit Against Colorado Over Marijuana Legalization

PUBLISHED: 2014/12/18

Nebraska, Oklahoma File Federal Suit Against Colorado Over Marijuana Legalization
 The states of Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a federal lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court Thursday, claiming that Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional under federal law.
 "Federal law undisputedly prohibits the production and sale of marijuana," Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning said Thursday in a statement. "Colorado has undermined the United States Constitution, and I hope the U.S. Supreme Court will uphold our constitutional principles."
 But Colorado Attorney General John Suthers isn't backing down. In a statement, he said he intends to defend the state's marijuana laws.
 â€œBecause neighboring states have expressed concern about Colorado-grown marijuana coming into their states, we are not entirely surprised by this action," Suthers said. "However, it appears the plaintiffsâ€™ primary grievance stems from non-enforcement of federal laws regarding marijuana, as opposed to choices made by the voters of Colorado. We believe this suit is without merit and we will vigorously defend against it in the U.S. Supreme Court.â€\\x9d
 Bruning, along with Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, argue that under the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause, Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana is unconstitutional because marijuana remains illegal under federal law. The clause states that in general, federal law takes precedence over state law.
 "The illegal products being distributed in Colorado are being trafficked across state lines thereby injuring neighboring states like Oklahoma and Nebraska," Pruitt said in a statement.
 The regulation of recreational marijuana -- as seen in programs currently in place in Colorado and Washington state, as well as those that will soon go into effect in Oregon and Alaska -- remains illegal under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act. The states that have legalized marijuana or softened penalties for possession have only been able to do so because of federal guidance urging federal prosecutors to refrain from targeting state-legal marijuana operations.
 Colorado voters approved Amendment 64, legalizing recreational marijuana in the state, in 2012. The first retail marijuana shops opened their doors on New Years Day 2014. To date, 23 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medical purposes. Four states have legalized recreational marijuana, along with voters in D.C. -- though the D.C. measure is the subject of a congressional Republican effort to block its implementation.
 With a majority of Americans now supporting marijuana legalization, and with states continuing to pass legalization laws, it seems unlikely that the federal government would push back against the legalizations. But it's not impossible. If the Supreme Court were to rule in favor of Nebraska and Oklahoma, all state marijuana laws, in any form, could be in jeopardy of being unraveled.
 Harvard economist Jeff Miron, a vocal supporter of marijuana policy reform, highlighted the precarious nature of state marijuana laws in a November op-ed for CNN, saying that Congress needs to act now on federal marijuana policy.
 "Despite the compelling case for legalization, and progress toward legalization at the state level, ultimate success is not assured," Miron wrote. "Federal law still prohibits marijuana, and existing jurisprudence (Gonzales v. Raich 2005) holds that federal law trumps state law when it comes to marijuana prohibition. So far, the federal government has mostly taken a hands-off approach to state medicalizations and legalizations, but in January 2017, the country will have a new president. That person could order the attorney general to enforce federal prohibition regardless of state law."
 Kevin Sabet, president of anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, applauded the action by Nebraska and Oklahoma.
 "We support this action by the attorneys general of Oklahoma and Nebraska because Colorado's decisions regarding marijuana are not without consequences to neighboring states, and indeed all Americans," Sabet said. "The legalization of marijuana is clearly in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act and is not implemented in a vacuum."
 Mason Tvert, communications director for Marijuana Policy Project, told The Huffington Post that MPP agrees with Suthers' opinion that the suit is "without merit."
 "Nebraska officials are acting like bullies, and they have no business trying to dictate Colorado's marijuana laws," Tvert said to HuffPost. "They are wasting their taxpayersâ€™ dollars by filing this suit and forcing Coloradans to pick up the bill for defending our state against it. Colorado's top law enforcement officials have better things to do and youâ€™d think Nebraskaâ€™s would, as well. These guys are on the wrong side of history."
 Marijuana Industry Group's Mike Elliott echoed Tvert's sentiments, adding that despite the multi-decade federal war on drugs, marijuana remains "universally available" -- including in Nebraska and Oklahoma.
 "If Nebraska and Oklahoma succeed, they will put the violent criminal organizations back in charge," Elliott said.
 Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.), a vocal supporter of drug policy reform who has sponsored multiple bills seeking protection for state-legal marijuana businesses and advocated full-scale federal legalization of the drug, told HuffPost that Nebraska and Oklahoma attempting to overturn the will of Colorado's voters is "outrageous."
 "Our federalist system is based on individual states of being able to enact policies that benefit their citizens, without the interference of other states," Polis said.

TITLE: Colorado's top cop defends pot law after challenges from neighboring states

Colorado's top cop defends pot law after challenges from neighboring states
 Denver (AP) â€“ Colorado's top law enforcement official promises to vigorously defend the state's historic law legalizing marijuana after Nebraska and Oklahoma asked the U.S. Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional, saying the drug is freely flowing into neighboring states.
 The two states filed a lawsuit seeking a court order to prevent Colorado from enforcing the measure known as Amendment 64, which was approved by voters in 2012 and allows recreational marijuana for adults over 21. The complaint says the measure runs afoul of federal law and therefore violates the Constitution's supremacy clause, which says federal laws trump state laws.
 Colorado Attorney General John Suthers said the lawsuit was without merit.
 "Because neighboring states have expressed concern about Colorado-grown marijuana coming into their states, we are not entirely surprised by this action," he said. "However, it appears the plaintiffs' primary grievance stems from non-enforcement of federal laws regarding marijuana, as opposed to choices made by the voters of Colorado."
 The lawsuit says Colorado marijuana flows into neighboring states undermining their efforts to enforce their anti-marijuana laws.
 "This contraband has been heavily trafficked into our state," Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning said at a news conference in Lincoln. "While Colorado reaps millions from the sale of pot, Nebraska taxpayers have to bear the cost."
 Colorado has raised more than $60 million in taxes, licenses and fees from medical and recreational marijuana, which has been sold in stores since January.
 The lawsuit says the sales have strained Nebraska and Oklahoma's finances and legal systems. Police are spending more time and money making arrests, housing inmates, impounding vehicles, seizing drugs and handling other problems related to Colorado pot.
 Bruning, a Republican, blamed U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder for failing to enforce the federal law's ban on drugs in Colorado.
 In a policy statement last year, the U.S. Justice Department noted it doesn't have the resources to police all violations of federal marijuana law. It laid out eight federal law enforcement priorities that states need to protect if they want to authorize "marijuana-related conduct." They include keeping marijuana in-state â€” something Oklahoma and Nebraska says Colorado has failed to do. The suit doesn't contain statistics to support the claim.
 Law enforcement agencies have long said anecdotally that they are feeling the impacts of Colorado's legal weed, making more marijuana arrests and seizing more of the drug.
 But there's no way to know exactly how much legal pot is leaving Colorado.
 The Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area wrote in a recent report that the amount of Colorado pot seized on highways increased from an annual average of 2,763 pounds between 2005 and 2008 to a yearly average of 3,690 pounds from 2009 to 2013. The weed was headed for at least 40 different states.
 Scotts Bluff County Sheriff Mark Overman, in western Nebraska, said Colorado marijuana is extra potent, making it worth more in his region and giving sellers a greater financial incentive to do business there.
 "I think this is overdue, and I think other states should jump on board," Overman said of the lawsuit. "I'm very frustrated. I take an oath of office, as does every other police officer in this country. I don't just get to pick and choose which laws I enforce."
 Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper told The Denver Post he spoke with Nebraska and Oklahoma officials about their concerns.
 "I'm not sure filing a lawsuit is the most constructive way to find a solution to whatever issues they are," he said.
 Legal scholars say it's too early to know how the Supreme Court might handle the case or if it will even accept it.
 "Right now, these regulations exist in legal no-man's-land," said Sam Kamin, a University of Denver law professor. "It's incredibly unusual for a state to be suing another state. (The lawsuit) certainly was a surprise to me given the movement at the federal level, which seems to be in favor of allowing states to experiment."
 It was unclear if other neighboring states would take similar action. Attorneys general in Utah and New Mexico said they had no immediate plans to join the suit.
 Brian Vicente, a Colorado attorney and legalization advocate who wrote Amendment 64, said the challenge is "political grandstanding" without merit. He said 23 states have enacted medical marijuana laws, and none have been overturned because of federal law.
 "I think it shows they are on the wrong side of history," Vicente said. "Colorado voters passed this measure, and more and more states are passing these laws. If the attorney general has a problem with how federal laws are being enforced he should bring that up with the U.S. attorney."

TITLE: Democratic Senate Candidate Faces Harsh Criticism Over Farmer Comments

PUBLISHED: 2014/03/26

Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa), who is running to succeed retiring Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), faced tough local coverage Tuesday after critical comments he made about Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) were made public.
 At a January fundraiser in Texas, Braley urged the attorneys present to contribute to his campaign and contrasted his background with Grassley's.
 "If you help me win this race, you may have someone with your background, your experience, your voice ... on the Senate Judiciary Committee," Braley said. "Or you might have a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school, never practiced law, serving as the next chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee," he continued, referring to Grassley.
 Braley's remarks were released Tuesday by America Rising, a conservative political action committee which conducts opposition research on Democrats.
 One of the Republican primary field's leading candidates, businessman Mark Jacobs, immediately released a radio ad in an attempt to capitalize on the negative attention focused on Braley.
 Both the Des Moines Register and the Quad-City Times featured the backlash over Braleyâ€™s comments on their front pages.
 Braley apologized to Grassley in person on Tuesday after state Republican Party leaders and a number of Braley's potential Republican general election opponents condemned his remarks.
 The representative also posted a statement Tuesday in which he apologized and emphasized that he has farmers in his family.
 â€œI apologize to Sen. Grassley and anyone I may have offended,â€\\x9d Braley wrote. â€œMy parents both grew up on Iowa farms during the Great Depression. It deeply influenced who they are and who I am, and gave me a profound appreciation for what farmers do for the world.â€\\x9d
 Grassley, who owns a farm, often notes in Senate Judiciary Committee hearings that he is the only non-lawyer on the panel, which oversees the judicial nominations process.
 Braley went to the University of Iowa's law school and worked as a lawyer in private practice before he was elected to the House of Representatives in 2006. His race is one of a handful across the country that will determine control of the Senate.

TITLE: Dem running for Senate in Iowa mocks Grassley as farmer 'who never went to law school'

PUBLISHED: 2014/03/25

Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is under fire after a video surfaced Tuesday of him mocking Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, as a â€œfarmer from Iowa who never went to law schoolâ€\\x9d â€” in the middle of Braleyâ€™s campaign for Senate in the state known for its agriculture industry.
 Braley apologized for the remarks in a written statement after the video was released. He said he â€œrespectsâ€\\x9d Grassley and proclaimed his support for Iowaâ€™s farmers.
 â€œI have tremendous respect for Iowa farmers and appreciate how important they are to our state, and Iâ€™m grateful to have the support of hundreds of farmers across Iowa,â€\\x9d he said.
 The video, which was posted online by the conservative super PAC America Rising, apparently shows Braley speaking to a group of lawyers at a fundraiser in Texas.
 Braley says if elected to the Senate to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, he would want to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said Grassley, though, would likely become chairman of that committee if Republicans take the Senate.
 â€œTo put this in stark contrast, if you help me win this race you may have someone with your background, your experience, your voice, someone whoâ€™s been literally fighting tort reform for thirty years, in a visible or public way, on the Senate Judiciary Committee,â€\\x9d he said. â€œOr, you might have a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school, never practiced law, serving as the next chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.â€\\x9d
 A spokesperson for Grassley fired back Tuesday, telling FoxNews.com that by Braleyâ€™s logic he, as a trial lawyer, would not be eligible to speak out on a number of policy issues like agriculture, energy or health care. The spokesperson also touted Grassleyâ€™s â€œstrong recordâ€\\x9d on the judiciary committee.
 â€œAlongside that, Sen. Grassleyâ€™s one of only two working family farmers in the United States Senate, where he brings Iowa common sense to work for ag, anti-trust, transportation, environmental, energy, trade, health care, communications, national security, and tax policy that works for all of America,â€\\x9d the aide said.

TITLE: Prominent Republicans call for Ariz. Gov. Jan Brewer to veto bill allowing denial of service to gays

PUBLISHED: 2014/02/26

Prominent Republicans are calling for Ariz. Gov. Jan Brewer to veto a controversial bill that would allow businesses to deny service over religious beliefs.
 The Republican governor returned home Tuesday afternoon to a political climate that is much different from just a week ago when she left for Washington the last five days for a governor's conference.
 The Arizona Legislature passed a bill last week allowing businesses whose owners cite sincerely held religious beliefs to deny service to gays. It allows any business, church or person to cite the law as a defense in any action brought by the government or individual claiming discrimination.
 The legislation has caused a national uproar. The chorus of opposition has grown each day, with the business community, the state's Super Bowl Committee and both Republican U.S. senators calling for a veto. Former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney was the latest prominent voice to weigh in and urge Brewer to veto the bill.
 Brewer will likely spend the next day or more pondering Senate Bill 1062 before deciding whether to sign or veto the legislation.
 There is widespread speculation that Brewer will veto the bill, but she has not said how she'll act, as is her longtime practice with pending legislation.
 Political observers in Arizona cautioned that the governor is deliberate and not prone to act hastily, despite the growing calls from business, politicians of all stripes, and civil rights groups for a veto.
 "She's no rookie to these high-profile deals â€” she gives both sides their due," said Doug Cole, a political consultant whose firm has run all of Brewer's campaigns for decades.
 "She's going to get a very detailed briefing from her legal team, and give the proponents their best shot, and the opponents their best shot," he said. "Everybody's going to get their say, and they've giving it."
 Some Republican senators who pushed the bill through the Legislature are now calling for a veto as well, but they cite "inaccurate" information about the measure for igniting a firestorm. They argue the bill is designed only to protect business owners with strong religious beliefs from discrimination lawsuits that have happened in other states. Some blame the media for blowing the law out of proportion.
 Democrats say that argument doesn't wash and call SB1062 "toxic" legislation that allows discrimination. They said they warned Republicans who voted for the bill that it was destined for trouble.
 "We brought this to their attention five weeks ago," said Sen. Steve Gallardo, D-Phoenix. "We said this is exactly what is going to happen. You have a bill here that's so toxic it's going to divide this Legislature. It's going to be polarizing the entire state. And that's exactly what happened."
 The bill was pushed by the Center for Arizona Policy, a social conservative group that opposes abortion and gay marriage. The group says the proposal simply clarifies existing state law and is needed to protect against increasingly activist federal courts.
 The center's president, Cathi Herrod, has been deriding what she called "fear-mongering" from the measure's opponents.
 "What's happened is our opponents have employed a new political tactic, and it's working," she said. "Throw out the threat of a boycott to attempt to defeat a bill, and you might just be able to be successful.
 Herrod added she was surprised and disappointed that "in America today, false attacks and irresponsible characterizations about a piece of legislation can so intimidate and persuade people to change their opinion about religious liberty."

TITLE: Aide to GOP lawmaker apologizes for Facebook post ripping Obama daughters

PUBLISHED: 2014/11/30

The communications director for a Republican member of Congress had to apologize Saturday for a Facebook post critical of the first daughters during President Barack Obama's Thanksgiving address earlier this week.
 Elizabeth Lauten wrote in a now-deleted Facebook post Friday that Malia and Sasha Obama, aged 16 and 13 respectively, should "try showing a little class" and described their outfits as more appropriate for "a spot at the bar."
 "Rise to the occasion. Dress like you deserve respect ... And certainly donâ€™t make faces during televised, public events." added Lauten, who works for Rep. Stephen Fincher, R-Tenn. The communications pro also took a shot at President Obama and the first lady, writing "your mother and father donâ€™t respect their positions very much, or the nation for that matter, so Iâ€™m guessing youâ€™re coming up a little short in the 'good role model' department.â€\\x9d
 The girls accompanied their daughter to Wednesday's ceremony, in which he pardoned two turkeys named Mac and Cheese. The tradition of Thanksgiving turkeys being presented to the president dates back to 1947, with the turkey pardon being permanently instituted in 1989.
 Lauten later apologized for her original post, writing "I quickly judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager. After many hours of prayer, talking to my parents, and re-reading my words online I can see more clearly just how hurtful my words were. ... I pledge to learn and grow (and I assure you I have) from this experience."
 The Washington Post reported that Lauten had confirmed that she had made both Facebook postings attributed to her. Neither the White House nor Fincher made any public comment about the issue Saturday.

TITLE: As Tension Eases on Ferguson's Streets, Focus Turns to Investigation

PUBLISHED: 2014/08/20

FERGUSON, Mo. â€” Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. arrived in St. Louis on Wednesday, meeting with community leaders and federal investigators even as local law enforcement officials said they were hopeful that they had turned a corner in calming the restive community of Ferguson after 12 days of protests and unrest.
 Mr. Holderâ€™s first stop was at a community college, where he met with people who told him about their own personal experiences with the local police, some of which they said helped fuel the rage that was ultimately ignited by the shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer on Aug. 9.
 There were more protests planned throughout the day and into the evening, but Capt. Ronald S. Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol said he believed they had reached â€œa turning point.â€\\x9d
 Captain Johnson, whose agency is overseeing security here, said there were only sporadic problems on Tuesday night, and none of the wide-scale looting and confrontations that had erupted on other nights. Still, the police did make 47 arrests overnight.
 As the tension on the street seemed to ease, the focus turned to the investigation into the shooting death of Michael Brown.
 A grand jury has been convened and was scheduled to meet Wednesday to begin hearing evidence, said Edward Magee, a spokesman for Robert P. McCulloch, the prosecuting attorney for St. Louis County.
 Protesters gathered outside Mr. McCullochâ€™s office on Wednesday, calling for him to step aside. They argued that he could not be impartial because his father, a police officer, was shot and killed by a black man while on duty when Mr. McCulloch was a child.
 Mr. McCulloch, speaking to a local radio station, categorically rejected that notion.
 â€œI know the pain the Brown family is going through right now,â€\\x9d he said.
 He said he has only one interest: conducting a fair and thorough investigation. But he acknowledged that Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri has the power to appoint a new prosecutor.
 â€œAnyone who wants me off the case needs to call up the governor and express their opinion to him,â€\\x9d Mr. McCulloch told KTRS radio.
 By failing to act, Mr. McCulloch said, the governor â€œundermines everything except the cover he has pulled over his head.â€\\x9d He told him to â€œman upâ€\\x9d and make a decision so that the case will not be further delayed.
 Mr. Magee cautioned that it could take weeks for the grand jury to consider all of the evidence. He said that Officer Darren Wilson, who shot Mr. Brown, had been interviewed by police investigators and would be given the opportunity to testify.
 The Justice Department, meanwhile, has started a separate inquiry. More than 40 F.B.I. agents have been dispatched to Ferguson, and Mr. Holder said they are not only investigating the shooting but also looking for any broad patterns of civil rights violations.
 In an open letter to the people of Ferguson, Mr. Holder said he understood the desire of residents for an â€œindependentâ€\\x9d inquiry.
 â€œThis is my pledge to the people of Ferguson: Our investigation into this matter will be full, it will be fair, and it will be independent,â€\\x9d Mr. Holder wrote in The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. â€œAnd beyond the investigation itself, we will work with the police, civil rights leaders, and members of the public to ensure that this tragedy can give rise to new understanding â€” and robust action â€” aimed at bridging persistent gaps between law enforcement officials and the communities we serve.â€\\x9d
 The frustrations in the community have been fueled in part by the slow pace with which the authorities have released information.
 In a sign of just how deep the distrust runs, there were three separate autopsies performed on Mr. Brownâ€™s body: one by the county medical examiner, one by a private pathologist hired by the family, and one by federal authorities.
 In addition to the many lingering questions about the shooting, the local authorities have also come under criticism for how they have handled the protests.
 Norm Stamper, the former Seattle police chief who was in charge during the protests that rocked that city in 1999, said that the wrong tone was set from the first day in Ferguson.
 â€œThe basic perspective that I have over this whole thing, dating back to the shooting incident itself, what we had were largely peaceful vigils and protests that were met with police tactics that were highly aggressive and militaristic,â€\\x9d he said. â€œThat response ignited what we have seen all week.â€\\x9d
 He reserved his harshest criticism for the use of tear gas by the police â€” a mistake he said he made in Seattle and one he regrets to this day.
 Since the first day of protests in Ferguson, the authorities shifted their response almost daily, adding to the sense that the situation was out of control.
 On one day, protesters were told to gather in one place. Another day, they were told to keep moving. Then a curfew was imposed. The next night, there was no curfew. The local police were in control; then another unit took over. The National Guard was finally brought in to try to temper the unrest, but its role was not exactly clear.
 â€œYou get governors and police chiefs and everyone gnashing their teeth,â€\\x9d Mr. Stamper said. â€œEven the protesters are commenting on that: what are they doing?â€\\x9d
 On Tuesday night, however, it seemed that some of that energy had gone from the streets. And the police also seemed more restrained, refraining from using tear gas.
 The evening began in a familiar fashion: Demonstrators marched along the street and chanted â€œHands up! Donâ€™t shoot!â€\\x9d and other slogans that have become common here since Mr. Brownâ€™s death.
 The authorities made at least 47 arrests after demonstrators tossed bottles toward police officers, some of whom used pepper spray to subdue some protesters. In some instances, teams of officers abruptly entered the crowd, detained a single person whom they had apparently focused on, and returned to West Florissant Avenue, where many of the recent confrontations have occurred.
 Although law enforcement officers in riot gear eyed the protesters while a police helicopter occasionally circled the city, there were no signs of trouble for long stretches of the evening.
 When a demonstration ended shortly before midnight, many of the demonstrators prayed.
 â€œNow thatâ€™s what I call a good protest,â€\\x9d Jonathan Smith, 45, said. â€œEnding in a prayer, no gas in the air.â€\\x9d

TITLE: U.S. Attorney Subpoenas Chris Christie Campaign Documents

PUBLISHED: 2014/01/23

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Attorneyâ€™s office in New Jersey has subpoenaed documents from the reelection campaign of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) and the New Jersey Republican State Committee, as part of its investigation into the "Bridgegate" scandal.
 In a statement issued Thursday, Mark Sheridan, a partner with Patton Boggs, said his law firm had been retained to represent both the campaign and the committee in connection with the investigation.
 "We can confirm that the Christie for Governor re-election campaign and the New Jersey Republican State Committee received subpoenas for documents from the U.S. Attorney's office, in addition to the subpoena the campaign previously received from the state legislative committee," said Sheridan. "All three subpoenas focus on the closure of lanes on the George Washington Bridge. The campaign and the state party intend to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney's office and the state legislative committee and will respond to the subpoenas accordingly."
 The Christie administration closed down two of the three George Washington Bridge access lanes in Fort Lee, N.J., in September, in what appeared to be a political retribution scheme aimed at the borough's Democratic mayor. The closures, which lasted for four days, caused massive traffic jams. They were orchestrated by a Christie ally at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, David Wildstein, along with one of Christie's deputy chiefs of staff, Bridget Kelly, and his then-campaign manager and top political adviser, Bill Stepien.
 Christie has maintained that he had no involvement in, or knowledge of, the plan.
 The New Jersey state legislature is also investigating the lane closures. The FBI and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, meanwhile, are looking into separate controversies over whether the Christie administration misused Hurricane Sandy relief dollars.

TITLE: John McCain Suggests Hillary Clinton's Use Of Personal Email Was Hypocritical

PUBLISHED: 2015/03/05

He may have a personal fondness for her, but Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) suggested Thursday that Hillary Clintonâ€™s exclusive use of personal email while serving as secretary of state was hypocritical.
 â€œThis is the same individual that just excoriated the Bush administration for supposedly hiding communications within the administration,â€\\x9d McCain said on MSNBCâ€™s â€œAndrea Mitchell Reports.â€\\x9d
 While serving as a senator from New York in 2007, Clinton criticized the Bush administration for its "secrecy," according to The Hill. "We know about the secret wiretaps, we know about the secret military tribunals, the secret White House email accounts," she said. "Itâ€™s a stunning record of secrecy and corruption, of cronyism run amok."
 Clinton, who is often described as the Democratic presidential frontrunner for 2016, has faced scrutiny since Monday when The New York Times reported that she may have violated federal records law by using a personal email account for all of her work messages as secretary of state. She served in that position from 2009 to 2013.
 Democrats came to her defense, and other media outlets soon pointed out that the rules against using personal email were not relayed to government officials until 2014. But likely GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush suggested that the use of personal email demonstrated a lack of transparency.
 Clinton responded to the controversy on Wednesday, tweeting that she had asked the State Department to make her private emails publicly available.
 While on Mitchell's show, McCain also raised the concern that there's no way of knowing if all of Clinton's emails have been saved, since they were not originally retained by the government.
 "The question that I think's gonna rise over time is, how can we be confident that once she carries out what she tweeted -- that she wants all the emails known -- how are we gonna know that? How are we gonna have verification of that?" McCain said. "So I think this is serious. And I'm willing to give her or anyone who defends her the benefit of defending it or explaining it, but on its face, it seems to be rather serious."

TITLE: Washington gov, Seattle mayor ban official travel to Indiana in wake of 'religious freedom' law

PUBLISHED: 2015/03/31

The backlash to Indiana's new religious freedom law grew Monday, even as state lawmakers move to clarify the legislation, with Wash. Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Ed Murray banning government-funded travel to Indiana.
 The statements are the latest boycott threats to emerge over claims that the law has the potential to discriminate against gays and others.
 Murray, a Democrat who is openly gay, issued his ban via executive order over the weekend, and Inslee issued his Monday afternoon.
 â€œI find Indianaâ€™s new law disturbing, particularly at a time when more and more states and people in America are embracing civil rights for everyone," Inslee said in a statement. "Washington will join other states and cities in opposing this law and I will impose an administration-wide ban on state-funded travel to Indiana."
 Murray says the law doesn't reflect Seattle residentsâ€™ values. He also has told all city departments to review their contracts to see whether Seattle is doing business with any company whose headquarters is in Indiana.
 â€œSeattleites know that discrimination has no place in our city,â€\\x9d he said in a statement. â€œThatâ€™s just equality 101.â€\\x9d
 The primary concern is that the law might allow a business to discriminate against gay residents, such as a baker being allowed refuse an order from a gay couple for a wedding cake.
 But state lawmakers and Republican Gov. Mike Pence have been defending and trying to explain the Religious Freedom Restoration Act ever since the governor signed it into law on Thursday. They note that then-President Bill Clinton in 1993 signed similar federal legislation into law, and 19 other states also have similar policies.
 However, the Indiana law differs in several ways, primarily in that it allows a business to assert a right to "the free exercise of religion."
 On Monday, state Senate President Pro Tem David Long and House Speaker Brian Bosma, both Republicans, held a press conference to further explain the law. They said they will swiftly try to "clarify" its language.
 â€œThe new law does not discriminate,â€\\x9d Long said. â€œAnd it will not be allowed. To the extent that we need to clarify through legislative action, we plan to do just that.â€\\x9d
 Aside from Indiana, 15 other states have introduced legislation in 2015 to craft or alter their religious freedom laws. Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas have introduced legislation to amend their laws. Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, North Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming are looking to put a similar law on their books.
 Bosma acknowledged a major concern is whether businesses will now be legally permitted to deny services to some people, as a result of the law, and that even he is unclear.
 â€œWe donâ€™t believe that will be the effect,â€\\x9d he said. â€œWe are looking at options to clarify that that's the case.â€\\x9d
 Long and Bosma also conceded they called the press conference because Pence failed to clearly explain the law during an appearance Sunday on ABCâ€™s â€œThis Week.â€\\x9d
 Pence said the legislation prohibits Indiana laws that "substantially burden" a person's ability to follow his or her religious beliefs, with the definition of "person" including religious institutions, businesses and associations.
 However, he did not answer directly when asked six times whether, under the law, it would be legal for a merchant to refuse to serve gay customers.
 Long on Monday also denied that a clarification of the law would be needed before this weekendâ€™s menâ€™s NCAA Final Four basketball championships, in Indianapolis.
 A record-breaking 158,682 people attended the games last year in Texas. And any boycott would have the potential to cut much anticipated revenue for Indianapolis-area hotels, restaurants and other businesses.
 The NCAA, whose headquarters is in Indianapolis, also has expressed concern about the law, as figures in corporate America and Hollywood voice their opposition.
 â€œWe are especially concerned about how this legislation could affect our student-athletes and employees,â€\\x9d said NCAA President Mark Emmert. â€œWe intend to closely examine the implications of this bill and how it might affect future events as well as our workforce."
 Angieâ€™s List, the business-rating website, this weekend put on hold plans to expand its Indianapolis headquarters.
 Actor George Takei is calling for a boycott. And actor Ashton Kutcher recently tweeted: â€œIndiana are you also going to allow Christian establishments to ban Jews from coming in? Or Vice Versa? Religious freedom??? #OUTRAGE.â€\\x9d

TITLE: NJ Gov Chris Christie to Throw His Hat in the Ring for White House Run

NJ Gov Chris Christie to Throw His Hat in the Ring for White House Run
 New Jersey Governor Chris Christie expected to become the latest Republican to throw his hat in the ring for 2016. Heâ€™ll make the announcement today at 11am from his hometown of Livingston, New Jersey.
 The Governor faces an uphill climb for the nomination with low poll numbers, and a fundraising deficit. The Washington Post reporter Robert Costa writes of Christie today, â€œhis status as the establishment favorite for the GOP nomination has vanished. Dogged by scandals and plummeting popularity in his home state, Christie has seen many of the mega-donors who once toasted him drift toward his rivals, including former Florida governor Jeb Bush.â€\\x9d
 But donâ€™t write him off. Maggie Haberman in the New York Times today explains why, â€œMore than any other candidate, Mr. Christie is poised to run a race that sells his personality -- brash, challenging and often combative -- as his main asset. He has become a maestro of the town hall meeting, standing in a suit taking questions from New Jersey residents around the state until none remain, leaving some people enraged but many more laughing, weeping or hoping he would come over and clasp their hand.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Benghazi Panel Wants To Interview Clinton About Emails

PUBLISHED: 2015/03/31

WASHINGTON -- The House Select Committee on Benghazi sent a formal interview request to Hillary Clintonâ€™s lawyer on Tuesday regarding emails she exchanged during her time as secretary of state.
 In a letter to the Clintonâ€™s lawyer, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the committee chairman, said the committee is not interested in emails relating to personal or private matters, and instead will focus solely on those pertaining to â€œLibya and Benghazi during the relevant time periods.â€\\x9d
 â€œToward that end and because of the Secretaryâ€™s unique arrangement with herself as it relates to public records during and after her tenure as Secretary of State, this Committee is left with no alternative but to request Secretary Clinton appear before this Committee for a transcribed interview to better understand decisions the Secretary made relevant to the creation, maintenance, retention, and ultimately deletion of public records,â€\\x9d Gowdy stated in the letter.
 Gowdy set a May 1 deadline for the interview.
 An interview, Gowdy argued, would provide protection for the likely 2016 presidential candidateâ€™s privacy and security for sensitive information.
 The request comes after reports revealed Clinton used a private email address and a server located in her New York home during her time as secretary of state. Last week, Gowdy said Clinton did not respond to any of the subpoenas requesting documents in the case, and her lawyer had informed the committee that the server used for emails during her tenure had been wiped clean.
 Gowdy said once Clinton is interviewed and all documents related to the 2012 Benghazi attack are shared, the committee will schedule a time for Clinton to testify publicly in a hearing.
 â€œWe share the Secretaryâ€™s desire these two conversations take place as quickly and efficiently as possible, and are willing to expedite both working with your office, the Secretaryâ€™s schedule and our Democrat colleagues on the Committee,â€\\x9d Gowdy said. â€œWhat the Committee cannot do is conclude its work without assurances the Committee has all relevant information necessary for us to discharge the duties required of us.â€\\x9d
 Gowdy went on to call Clintonâ€™s email situation â€œhighly unusual, if not unprecedented,â€\\x9d and said it â€œexacerbatesâ€\\x9d lawmakersâ€™ needs to â€œunderstand what the Secretary did.â€\\x9d
 Earlier this month, Clinton said she had a private email account because she â€œthought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two.â€\\x9d
 She admitted that â€œlooking back,â€\\x9d it would have been better to carry the second phone.
 Clinton is not the only government official to use a private email for work. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said he used a private email during his time in office, as did Jeb Bush when he served as governor of Florida.

TITLE: Obama Aide Calls Netanyahuâ€™s Planned Visit â€˜Destructiveâ€™ to U.S.-Israel Ties

PUBLISHED: 2015/02/25

WASHINGTON â€” Susan E. Rice, President Obamaâ€™s national security adviser, sharply criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Tuesday over his plans to address a joint meeting of Congress next week, saying his actions had hurt his nationâ€™s relationship with the United States.
 Mr. Netanyahuâ€™s decision to travel to Washington to deliver the speech two weeks before the Israeli elections has â€œinjected a degree of partisanship, which is not only unfortunate, I think itâ€™s destructive of the fabric of the relationship,â€\\x9d Ms. Rice said in an interview on the PBS television program â€œCharlie Rose.â€\\x9d
 Her comments marked the strongest public rebuke to date by the Obama administration since Mr. Netanyahu accepted an invitation from Speaker John A. Boehner to make his case to Congress against a nuclear deal with Iran, which is a priority of Mr. Obamaâ€™s. It is also the frankest acknowledgment yet by a top American official of the degree to which the controversy has damaged United States-Israeli relations.
 The speech, scheduled for March 3, was arranged by Mr. Boehner and the Israeli ambassador without consulting the White House â€” a move that Mr. Obamaâ€™s team has called a breach of protocol.
 The president has said he will not meet with Mr. Netanyahu during his visit to avoid any appearance that he is trying to influence the Israeli elections that are scheduled for mid-March.
 The episode is a low point in the tense relationship between Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu and has touched off weeks of mostly anonymous sniping and finger-pointing.
 Top administration officials have hinted more openly of their displeasure in recent days.
 The White House on Wednesday said that Mr. Obama agreed with Ms. Riceâ€™s assessment, saying he had raised the same concerns several times.
 Her comments, said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, are â€œentirely consistent with what the president has already said.â€\\x9d
 â€œAllowing this relationship to be subjected to party politics does weaken the relationship,â€\\x9d Mr. Earnest said.
 Mr. Earnest said he did not know whether Mr. Obama and Ms. Rice had talked in advance of the interview about what she would say about Mr. Netanyahuâ€™s visit.
 Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who as president of the Senate would be expected to attend, has said he will be traveling abroad. Secretary of State John Kerry said Tuesday that he would be in Switzerland negotiating with the Iranians. The White House has also not committed to sending a representative next week to the American Israel Public Affairs Committeeâ€™s conference, where Mr. Netanyahu is also scheduled to appear.
 The Israeli prime minister himself has turned down a request by Democratic senators for a private meeting, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said Tuesday.
 â€œWe offered the prime minister an opportunity to balance the politically divisive invitation from Speaker Boehner with a private meeting with Democrats who are committed to keeping the bipartisan support of Israel strong,â€\\x9d Mr. Durbin said in a statement. â€œHis refusal to meet is disappointing to those of us who have stood by Israel for decades.â€\\x9d
 In a letter released by Mr. Durbinâ€™s office, Mr. Netanyahu said such a meeting â€œcould compound the misperception of partisanship regarding my upcoming visit.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Netanyahu said Tuesday that he was making the trip because it was his obligation to â€œdo everything I can to preventâ€\\x9d a nuclear agreement with Iran.
 â€œTherefore, I will go to Washington to address the American Congress, because the American Congress is likely to be the final brake before the agreement between the major powers and Iran,â€\\x9d he said as he toured a military base in southern Israel.
 Ms. Rice demurred when asked whether she believed Mr. Netanyahu was making the speech to gain political favor.
 â€œIâ€™m not going to ascribe motives to the prime minister,â€\\x9d she told Mr. Rose. â€œThe point is, we want the relationship between the United States and Israel to be unquestionably strong, immutable, regardless of political seasons in either country, regardless of which party may be in charge in either country.
 â€œWeâ€™ve worked very hard to have that,â€\\x9d she said, â€œand we will work very hard to maintain that.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Marco Rubio Lays Out Hawkish Foreign Policy Doctrine Invoking Kennedy

PUBLISHED: 2015/05/13

NEW YORK -- U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) set forth a foreign policy vision Wednesday that invoked President John F. Kennedy in an assertive call to project American power abroad.
 In comments delivered at the Council on Foreign Relations, the conservative senator vying for the GOP presidential nomination said the world would be safer if the U.S. military had a bigger budget and America asserted itself more aggressively across the globe.
 While the threats facing the United States have changed in the 21st century, America's global influence remains a benevolent force, Rubio said.
 "President Kennedy, like most presidents before and since, understood what I believe our current president does not: that American strength is a means of preventing war, not promoting it,â€\\x9d Rubio said. â€œAnd that weakness, on the other hand, is the friend of danger and the enemy of peace."
 "Sadly, I believe President Obama often disagrees with that simple truth," Rubio added. "He entered office believing America was too hard on our adversaries, too engaged in too many places, and that if we just took a step back and did some more 'nation building at home' -- ceding leadership to other countries -- America would be better liked and the world better off."
 In laying out what his campaign calls the "Rubio Doctrine," the presidential hopeful said he was guided by three principles: "American strength," "the protection of the American economy in a globalized world" and "moral clarity regarding Americaâ€™s core values."
 From his seat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Rubio has already played a key role in U.S. foreign policy debates, often staking out positions that directly counter President Barack Obama's administration.
 The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has challenged Obama's efforts to normalize diplomatic relations with the island, saying that closer ties would only help the communist Castro government keep power. Rubio has also opposed the Obama administrationâ€™s negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, pressed for more support of rebels in Syria and advocated to increase aid to the government of Ukraine to counter Russia's influence in the east of the country.
 In Wednesday's speech the senator also took a swipe at Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, calling her tenure as secretary of state "ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst."
 Journalist Charlie Rose asked Rubio after the speech whether invoking Kennedy and the Cold War might make him appear backward-looking at a time that Rubio's campaign portrays other U.S. leaders as â€œtrapped in the past." Rubio responded that the Kennedy statements represented "timeless" truths.
 Rubio also told Rose he would not have authorized the 2003 invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam Hussein's regine if he knew Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction.
 â€œNot only would I have not been in favor of it, but President [George W.] Bush wouldnâ€™t have been in favor of it,â€\\x9d Rubio said.
 Bushâ€™s brother Jeb, who has all but formally announced his bid for the Republican presidential nomination, raised eyebrows Monday after telling Fox News he supported the invasion even now that he knows Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction. Jeb Bush later said he had misunderstood the question.

TITLE: Susan Rice calls Netanyahu's Capitol Hill speech 'destructive' to US-Israel relations

PUBLISHED: 2015/02/25

National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuâ€™s upcoming Capitol Hill address will be a â€œdestructiveâ€\\x9d force in long-standing U.S.-Israel relations, adding more political acrimony to the already contentious visit.
 Netanyahu was invited by House Speaker John Boehner, the leader of the Republican-controlled chamber, without him first conferring with the White House or State Department.
 Such a move is generally considered a diplomatic no-no, but Boehner says he wanted to bring in Netanyahu to address the nuclear threat from Iran amid ongoing negotiations between Washington and Tehran. The visit, though, has further challenged the strained relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu.
 "It's destructive to the fabric of the relationship," Rice said Tuesday on PBSâ€™s the â€œCharlie Roseâ€\\x9d show. â€œItâ€™s always been bipartisan. We need to keep it that way."
 Rice's statements were among the Obama administration's toughest on Netanyahu's speech, set for March 3. To date, administration officials had maintained a more low-key stance, voicing concerns about the visit while saying Obama would not meet with his Israeli counterpart strictly out of a desire not to influence Israel's tight elections.
 But tensions are rising on all sides.
 Rice's comments came as Netanyahu turned down an invitation to meet privately with leading Senate Democrats during his trip to Washington, saying such a session could "compound the misperception of partisanship" surrounding his visit.
 Netanyahu told Sens. Dick Durbin, of Illinois, and Dianne Feinstein, of California, that he regrets the invitation has been perceived by some to be political or partisan.
 "I can assure you that my sole intention in accepting it was to voice Israel's grave concerns about a potential nuclear agreement with Iran that could threaten the survival of my country," he told the senators in a letter.
 U.S. officials suggest Netanyahuâ€™s trip is aimed primarily at derailing a nuclear deal with Iran, a signature Obama foreign policy objective.
 While Netanyahu has long been skeptical of the negotiations, his opposition has increased over what he sees as Obama's willingness to make concessions that would leave Iran on the brink of being able to build a nuclear weapon. U.S. and Iranian officials reported progress in negotiations this week on a deal that would clamp down on Tehran's nuclear activities for at least 10 years but then slowly ease restrictions. Israeli officials warned this week that such a deal would allow Iran to become a nuclear threshold state.
 Vice President Biden won't attend the Netanyahu speech. And more than a half-dozen House and Senate Democrats also have said they will skip the event, calling it an affront to Obama and the administration as they negotiate with Iran over its nuclear program.
 But Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called Bidenâ€™s absence â€œappalling and unacceptable.â€\\x9d
 "I donâ€™t know where Joe Biden will be or what he will be doing, but I canâ€™t believe itâ€™s more important than being in the chamber and listening to our best ally in the region -- Israel -- about the biggest threat to mankind, a nuclear-armed Iran. ... It shows complete disrespect, it shows theyâ€™re more worried about the politics in Israel than receiving information about a common threat," Graham, R-S.C., said Tuesday night on Fox News' "On the Record with Greta Van Susteren."
 Durbin said he regretted that Netanyahu could not meet with the Democrats.
 "We offered the prime minister an opportunity to balance the politically divisive invitation from Speaker Boehner." Durbin said. "His refusal to meet is disappointing to those of us who have stood by Israel for decades."

TITLE: Arkansas governor seeks changes in religious freedom bill

PUBLISHED: 2015/04/01

Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday urged state lawmakers to change a controversial religious freedom bill sent to his desk a day earlier, in the face of criticism that it could allow businesses and others to discriminate based on sexual orientation.
 Hutchinson had initially said he planned to sign the bill but backed off as his state, overnight, became the new focal point of a nationwide backlash over such legislation. Indiana for days has faced similar criticism for a related religious freedom bill.
 During a press conference in the state capital of Little Rock, Hutchinson said he wants to strike the "right balance." The governor, amid calls by critics to veto the bill, made clear he still supports the intent of the legislation -- which prohibits state and local governments from infringing upon someone's religious beliefs without a compelling interest. But he said he wants changes made so it more closely mirrors a 1993 federal law.
 "I asked that changes be made in the legislation," Hutchinson said, urging state lawmakers to "recall" the bill -- or pass additional legislation -- to "remedy" the issue.
 The announcement reflects the intense debate in state capitals across the country where such legislation is being considered. Backers say the intent was to simply replicate the 1993 federal law and similar laws in place in 19 other states. But when Indiana passed a slightly more expansive version which critics said could allow discrimination by businesses, Indiana lawmakers and Gov. Mike Pence later vowed to "clarify" the language in response to complaints.
 Hutchinson, too, said the country is clearly split on how to balance religious traditions with non-discrimination.
 At its heart, he said, "this bill is not really complicated." But he cited a "generational gap." As evidence, the governor said even his own son had signed a petition urging him to veto the bill.
 Hutchinson's chief complaint was that some provisions do not "precisely mirror" the federal law, and he wants that addressed. He said he's also working on an executive order to address the issue of tolerance.
 Echoing the reaction to Indiana's law, Hutchinson has faced pressure from the state's top employers, including retail giant Wal-Mart, which complained that the measure was discriminatory and would stifle economic development. Little Rock's mayor, the city's Chamber of Commerce and Arkansas-based data services company Acxiom all urged the governor to reject the measure in recent days.
 The Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights group, has run ads in Silicon Valley targeting technology firms Hutchinson hopes to attract to the state.
 Prior to the passage Tuesday of the Arkansas bill, the White House repeated its opposition to the Indiana law.
 "This kind of public outcry ... is indicative of how this piece of legislation flies in the face of values that people all across America strongly support," said White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. "Governor Pence falsely tried to suggest the law is the same as the 1993 law. That is not true."
 Earnest also said the Indiana law was a "significant expansion" of current law.

TITLE: Huckabee announces 2016 White House bid, with focus on economy and security | Fox News

PUBLISHED: 2015/05/05

Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee announced Tuesday he is running for president, delivering an economy- and security-centered message that he hopes will appeal to everyday Americans and distinguish him from the already-crowded Republican field.
 Huckabee, who is embarking on his second presidential run, made the announcement in his hometown of Hope, Ark. In a 30-minute speech that focused on his humble beginnings, Huckabee vowed to end â€œstagnant wages,â€\\x9d protect Medicare and defeat radical Islamic terrorism.
 â€œFolks cannot seem to get ahead or even stay even,â€\\x9d he said.
 Huckabee, a former Baptist minister, ran for president in 2008, winning eight states including the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses before running out of money and exiting the race.
 â€œFolks, itâ€™s a long way from a little brick rented house on Second Street in Hope, Arkansas, to the White House,â€\\x9d he said. "But here in this small town called Hope, I was raised to believe where a person started didn't mean that is where he had to stop. I always believed that kid could go from hope to higher ground."
 The 59-year-old Huckabee has a strong following among the partyâ€™s evangelical Christian base but this time will face stiff competition for that vote from such primary candidates as Dr. Ben Carson and Sen. Ted Cruz, of Texas.
 He frequently repeated the phrase, â€œHope to higher ground,â€\\x9d which appears to be a slogan of sorts for his 2016 campaign.
 He also took a swipe at President Obama for declining to recognize the Islamic State group as radical Islamic terrorists and vowed to stop them.
 "I wonder if he can watch a Western from the '50s and be able to figure out who the good guy and the bad guys really are," Huckabee said. "As president, I promise you, we will no longer try to contain Jihadism. We will conquer it.â€\\x9d
 He also vowed to protect Medicare and give states more of a say in government and education.
 Huckabee, who left his job as a Fox News host earlier this year in preparation for a potential 2016 run, was Arkansas governor from 1996 to 2007, serving after Bill Clinton, who also is from Hope. And he was the stateâ€™s lieutenant governor from 1993 to 1996.
 Even before the speech, Huckabee was trying to position himself as the GOP candidate best equipped to defeat Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner.
 In a recent campaign video, Huckabee argued that in his more than 10 years as governor, he took on Democrats in "Bill Clinton's Arkansas" after then-candidate Bill Clinton won election to the White House in 1992.
 "Every day in my life in politics was a fight," Huckabee says in the video, released as a preview of his Tuesday announcement. "But any drunken redneck can walk into a bar and start a fight. A leader only starts a fight he's prepared to finish."
 The field of confirmed and potential GOP presidential candidates includes more than a dozen people.
 A new NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll of GOP primary voters shows 23 percent picked former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush as their first choice.
 Bush is followed in the poll by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio with 18 percent, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker with 14 percent, Cruz and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul with 11 percent, Carson with 7 percent, Huckabee and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at 5 percent, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry at 2 percent and former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina at 1 percent.
 Huckabee is the third Republican this week to announce a 2016 White House bid, following Fiorina and Carson, a retired neurosurgeon They join Cruz, Paul and Rubio.
 Campaign aides say Huckabeeâ€™s path to winning the party nomination this time will be to appeal to working-class cultural conservatives, pitching their candidate as an economic populist and foreign affairs hawk who holds deeply conservative views on social issues such as abortion and gay marriage.
 Huckabee advocates a national consumption tax, which is similar to a sales tax, to replace the existing federal taxes on personal income and payrolls. He rejects calls for a minimum wage hike, saying his proposals will yield a "maximum wage" for workers.
 On immigration, he insists on a secure border and bemoans the presence of millions of people who are living in the country illegally, though he favors a creating a path to citizenship for children of immigrant parents who brought them to the U.S. illegally.
 Like other Republican White House hopefuls, Huckabee is sharply critical of Obama's foreign policy. He has called for "bombing the daylights" out of Islamic State targets in the Middle East, though he says American troops should be deployed to the region only as part of an international coalition that includes nations such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan.
 But whatever the issue, Huckabee, also an author, wraps his appeal as a pitch to everyday Americans who he says "don't feel like anybody understands or knows who they are, much less cares what's happening to them."
 Evangelical Christian voters helped Huckabee win the Iowa caucuses in 2008 and finish a strong second in South Carolina, the largest of the early-voting states.
 He would need to replicate that early success to create an opening to build a wider coalition and compete deep into the primary schedule.

TITLE: Susan Rice: Netanyahu Visit 'Destructive' To U.S.-Israel Relationship

PUBLISHED: 2015/02/25

Susan Rice, President Barack Obama's national security adviser, said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planned speech in front of a joint session of Congress will be "destructive" to U.S.-Israel relations.
 "What has happened over the last several weeks, by virtue of the invitation that was issued by the Speaker [John Boehner] and the acceptance of it by Prime Minister Netanyahu two weeks in advance of his election, is that on both sides, there has now been injected a degree of partisanship, which is not only unfortunate, I think it's destructive of the fabric of the relationship," Rice told PBS' Charlie Rose.
 "It's always been bipartisan," Rice added. "We need to keep it that way. We want it that way. I think Israel wants it that way. The American people want it that way. When it becomes injected or infused with politics, that's a problem."
 Obama has said he will not meet with Netanyahu ahead of his speech in March, saying it would be "inappropriate" to meet with the leader two weeks before the Israeli elections. Netanyahu was invited to speak in front of a joint session of Congress by House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), who did not seek approval from the White House before sending the invitation.
 Several lawmakers have spoken out against the speech, saying it could cause additional strain on international talks over Iran's nuclear plans. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) called Netanyahu's speech "a tawdry and high-handed stunt" in a statement earlier this month.

TITLE: Arkansas Gov. Signs Amended Religious Freedom Bill

PUBLISHED: 2015/04/02

Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) signed a revised version of the state's Religious Freedom Reformation Act on Thursday, one day after refusing to sign an earlier version of the bill over concerns about discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals.
 Earlier Thursday, the Republican-controlled state legislature passed a new version of the bill at the governor's request, amending provisions that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers. The amended legislation mirrors the federal RFRA.
 Meanwhile, legislators in Indiana have made changes to the controversial RFRA signed into law by Gov. Mike Pence (R) last week. On Thursday, the state's general assembly passed new language explicitly stating that the law does not allow discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The changes came amid immense national backlash, with dozens of politicians, business leaders and celebrities speaking out against the bill.
 In a Wednesday press conference announcing his opposition to the initial version of the bill, Hutchinson said his son had asked him to veto the legislation.
 "My son Seth signed the petition asking me, Dad, the governor, to veto this bill," he said. "And he gave me permission to make that reference, and it shows that families -- and there's a generational difference of opinion on these issues."
 Hutchinson also faced pressure from Walmart, which is headquartered in the state. CEO Doug McMillon called on the governor to veto the bill, which he said "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion."

TITLE: Washington State To Boycott Indiana Over LGBT Discrimination Law

PUBLISHED: 2015/03/30

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) announced Monday that he would ban state-funded travel to Indiana, where a controversial new law could allow businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian individuals for religious reasons.
 â€œI find Indianaâ€™s new law disturbing, particularly at a time when more and more states and people in America are embracing civil rights for everyone," Inslee said in a statement. "Washington will join other states and cities in opposing this law and I will impose an administration-wide ban on state funded travel to Indiana."
 In his statement, Inslee cited the case of a Washington-based florist who was recently ordered to pay a fine for discriminating against a gay couple who sought her services.
 "We in Washington stand for equality," he said. "I applaud those companies and organizations that have spoken out against the law and said they would not locate or expand operations in Indiana. I want to invite all those organizations, and anyone interested in a state that promotes equality and opportunity, to come visit Washington. We are open for business, and open to all people."
 Earlier Monday, Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy (D) took a similar stand against the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed into law by Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) at a private ceremony last week. The measure has sparked national backlash, with critics warning that the law provides legal justification for discrimination against LGBT individuals.
 In addition to Connecticut and Washington, San Francisco and Seattle have also imposed bans on city-funded travel to the state. The mayors of Minnesota's Twin Cities, Minneapolis and St. Paul, have also condemned the measure.
 The cities and states are joined by a number of business leaders speaking out against the law. Apple chief Tim Cook called the law "dangerous" in a Washington Post op-ed, while Salesforce's Marc Benioff canceled the company's planned events in the state. And on Monday, the executives of nine Indiana-based companies, including Angie's List and Anthem, sent a letter to Pence outlining their concerns.
 "Regardless of the original intention of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, we are deeply concerned about the impact it is having on our employees and on the reputation of our state," reads the letter.
 Pence has defended his decision to sign the bill, claiming that the measure has been "grossly misconstrued as a 'license to discriminate.'"
 "I abhor discrimination. I believe in the Golden Rule that you should 'do unto others as you would have them do unto you,'" Pence wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. "If I saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple, I wouldnâ€™t eat there anymore. As governor of Indiana, if I were presented a bill that legalized discrimination against any person or group, I would veto it. Indianaâ€™s new law contains no reference to sexual orientation. It simply mirrors federal law that President Bill Clinton signed in 1993."
 However, the governor and legislative leaders say they will seek to clarify that the law does not protect discrimination.
 â€œIt is not the intent of the law to discriminate against anyone, and it will not be allowed to discriminate against anyone,â€\\x9d state Senate President Pro Tem David Long (R) said. â€œWe hope to have a fix very soon."

TITLE: In first foreign policy speech, candidate Rubio pushes stronger U.S. leadership

PUBLISHED: 2015/05/13

New York â€“ In his first major foreign policy speech since launching his presidential campaign, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio said if elected, he would prioritize a strong military, take aggressive steps to fight nations that undermine global commerce and ensure that U.S. is a world moral leader.
 The Florida Republican, who delivered his speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in Manhattan on Wednesday, said that the United States was losing its place as a world military and moral power because of what he depicted as the Obama administrationâ€™s overly cautious responses to crises overseas.
 â€œSince the end of the Cold War, the threats facing America have changed, but the need for American strength has not,â€\\x9d Rubio said. â€œIt has only grown more pressing as the world has grown more interconnected.â€\\x9d
 â€œIt takes forethought to design and many years to build the capabilities we may need at a momentâ€™s notice," the 43-year-old said. "So to restore American strength, my first priority will be to adequately fund our military. This would be a priority even in times of peace and stability, though the world today is neither peaceful nor stable.â€\\x9d
 Rubio repeated his characterization of Obama as a president so concerned with softening any perception other nations has of the United States as a bully that he erred in acting in the other extreme, eager to acquiesce to foreign governments that have thumbed their noses at the U.S. and international laws.
 â€œ[Obama] demonstrated a disregard for our moral purpose that at times flirted with disdain,â€\\x9d said Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants. â€œHe criticized America for having â€˜arroganceâ€™ and the audacity to â€˜dictate our termsâ€™ to other nations. From his reset with Russia, to his open hand to Iran, to his unreciprocated opening to Cuba, he has embraced regimes that systematically oppose every principle our nation has long championed.â€\\x9d
 Rubio also said that the United States must move decisively when aggressive nations such as China and Iran attempt to undermine the economic interests of the United States as well as other nations.
 "Russia, China, Iran or any other nation that attempts to block global commerce will know to expect a response from my administration.â€\\x9d
 The Democratic National Committee issued a brief statement shortly after Rubio's speech:
 â€œOkay. So hereâ€™s Rubioâ€™s alleged â€˜newâ€™ foreign policy. Troops in the Middle East permanently. A Cuba policy that is stuck in the Cold War. Unwillingness to even start a discussion of a two state solution. Keeping Guantanamo Bay open. No plan forward on Iran."
 And it ended with: â€œNeoconservative meets Cold War: thatâ€™s the Rubio doctrine.â€\\x9d
 Rubioâ€™s foreign policy agenda â€“ often hawkish in approach â€“ has been a hallmark of his service in the Senate, and now in his campaign. He says that as a member of Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the Senate Committee on Intelligence, he is privy to information that form the basis of his decision on how the United States must approach foreign policy.
 Rubio said Obama "wasted no time stripping parts from the engine of American strength," and cast former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as his loyal deputy.
 "[Clinton] was the chief architect of a foreign policy that was a disaster," he said during an interview with Charlie Rose following the speech.
 "We simply cannot afford to elect as our next president one of the leading agents of this administration's foreign policy â€” a leader from yesterday whose tenure as secretary of state was ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst," Rubio said, according to the prepared text of remarks he was to deliver at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
 He even has taken tougher stances on foreign policy than some of his Republican colleagues, who have softened their views on diplomatic relations with Cuba â€“ to which Rubio objects â€“ and how to handle the nuclear talks with Iran.
 Some in the GOP have called for spending cuts in military spending, with which he disagrees.
 As he often has in Senate hearings, Rubio assailed Obama for stressing dialogues and diplomacy over ironclad dealings with heads of foreign governments that have been openly hostile to the United States, and which continue to exercise oppression against political dissidents.
 â€œThe world is at its safest when America is at its strongest,â€\\x9d Rubio said. â€œWhen America has the mightiest Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and intelligence community in the world, the result is more peace, not more conflict.â€\\x9d
 Rubio said, after his speech, in a question-and-answer session with TV host Charlie Rose, that "Obama has embraced regimes that systematically opposed our principles."
 Rose asked Rubio what he though of Pope Francis's embrace of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba.
 Rubio said his priorities and those of the pope's are by necessity different.
 He defended keeping the embargo.
 He said having anything to do with Cuba is to avail oneself of properties stolen from Cubans by the Cuban government during the revolution.
 Rubio said the embargo is not to blame for Cuba's failed economy.
 He said the rest of the world does not have an embargo against Cuba. So why, he asked, does Cuba not have Toyotas or modern goods from other nations?
 As for Iran, Rubio said it cannot be trusted.
 "Iran has always had a secret component to its nuclear program," he said. "They know once international sanctions are lifted, they can never be reimposed."

TITLE: Hillary Clinton Urges Obama to Listen to Democrats on Trade Deal

PUBLISHED: 2015/06/14

DES MOINES â€“ Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday urged President Obama to listen to congressional Democrats â€“ particular the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi â€“ and make changes to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that reflect their concerns about protecting American jobs and wages.
 In her first detailed comments on the trade deal since the House of Representatives refused on Friday to allow Mr. Obama to negotiate it freely, Mrs. Clinton laid out a far more calibrated position on the deal than many Democrats and Republicans have taken. She declined to take sides on the Friday vote itself but instead allied herself with Democratic critics of the deal â€” without actually opposing it.
 She argued that the House vote gave Mr. Obama â€œthis amazing opportunityâ€\\x9d to seek concessions from Pacific trading partners to salvage the deal.
 â€œThe president should listen to and work with his allies in Congress, starting with Nancy Pelosi, who have expressed their concerns about the impact that a weak agreement would have on our workers to make sure we get the best, strongest deal possible,â€\\x9d Mrs. Clinton said at a rally here.
 â€œAnd if we donâ€™t get it, there should be no deal,â€\\x9d she added.
 Mrs. Clinton indicated that if she were president, she would not abandon the 12-nation Pacific trade deal â€“ as some Democrats want â€“ but would use the opposition in Congress as negotiating leverage.
 â€œI am willing to try now to see whether you can push to get rid of the objectionable parts, to drive a harder bargain on some of the other parts,â€\\x9d Mrs. Clinton said at the rally, her first here as a candidate for the 2016 presidential nomination.
 Mrs. Clinton has been criticized by Republicans and some Democrats for saying little about the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal in recent weeks, especially since she had made favorable comments about it as secretary of state. She is facing many Democratic primary voters who have deep misgivings about trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, that President Bill Clinton signed, and she faces rivals for the 2016 nomination like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont who flatly oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
 A few hours before Mrs. Clintonâ€™s remarks, Mr. Sanders repeated his challenge to her to oppose the trade agreement.
 â€œI would hope that the secretary joins Elizabeth Warren, Sherrod Brown and the vast majority of Democrats in the Congress in saying, â€˜No, we have got to defeat this piece of legislation,â€™ â€\\x9d Mr. Sanders said on CBSâ€™s â€œFace the Nation,â€\\x9d referring to fellow senators.
 Without naming names, Mrs. Clinton sought to distinguish herself from Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, as well as from fervent supporters of the deal like some of the Republicans running for president.
 â€œNo president would be a tougher negotiator on behalf of American workers with either our trading partners or Republicans on Capitol Hill than I would be,â€\\x9d Mrs. Clinton said. â€œThere are the voices that are for the deal no matter whatâ€™s in it, and there are voices that are against the deal no matter whatâ€™s in it. I kind of fall in the group that says, â€˜Letâ€™s find out whatâ€™s in it, and letâ€™s make it as good as it can be before we make the decision.â€™â€\\x9d
 Mrs. Clinton invoked Ms. Pelosiâ€™s name twice during her remarks and appeared to agree with Ms. Pelosi that â€œthere are some specifics in there that could and should be changed.â€\\x9d She said she supported trade adjustment authority to protect American jobs, but otherwise did not delve into details.
 â€œLetâ€™s take the lemons and turn it into lemonade,â€\\x9d she said.
 Later on Sunday, at a house party with Democrats in Burlington, Iowa, Mrs. Clinton was more explicit in challenging Mr. Obama by setting expectations for him to work with congressional Democrats on the trade deal. Mrs. Clinton called Ms. Pelosi â€œas strong a supporterâ€\\x9d as Mr. Obama has, and said she hoped Mr. Obama would â€œseizeâ€\\x9d the chance to work with Democrats to improve the trade pact.
 â€œMy view is the White House should call Nancy and a few other of the Democrats to say, â€˜What would it take to get an agreement that would be better and not worse for American workers?â€™â€\\x9d Mrs. Clinton said, aligning herself with a potential future ally (Ms. Pelosi) over a lame-duck president.
 â€œI have held my peace because I thought it was important for the Congress to have a full debate without thrusting presidential politics and candidates into it,â€\\x9d Mrs. Clinton added. â€œBut now I think the president and his team could have a chance to drive a harder bargain, because they are now in the position of saying to all of these other countries â€˜we need to maximize the number of winners.â€™â€\\x9d

TITLE: Chris Christie Announces Run, Pledging â€˜Truthâ€™ About Nationâ€™s Woes

PUBLISHED: 2015/06/30

LIVINGSTON, N.J. â€” Gov. Chris Christie declared an uphill candidacy for president on Tuesday with New Jersey-style swagger, unconcealed disgust for Washington and a high regard for his own candor, vowing that â€œthere is one thing you will know for sure: I say what I mean and I mean what I say.â€\\x9d
 Relying on his biggest, and perhaps his last, remaining advantage in a field of better-financed and better-liked rivals â€” his personality â€” Mr. Christie portrayed himself as the only candidate in the Republican field who is forthright and forceful enough to run the country.
 â€œWe need strength and decision-making and authority back in the Oval Office,â€\\x9d he said.
 Pacing the stage without a prepared text and raising his voice to a shout at times, he vowed to campaign and govern as a colorful teller of difficult truths, even if â€œit makes you cringe every once in a while.â€\\x9d
 â€œI am not running for president of the United States as surrogate for being elected prom king of America,â€\\x9d Mr. Christie said inside the gymnasium at the high school where he was president of his class all three years.
 â€œI am not going to be the most popular guy who looks into your eye every day and says what you want to hear,â€\\x9d he continued.
 Trying to claw his way back to the top of the Republican field, Mr. Christie took a pointed swipe at his rivals who are in the United States Senate, like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, who have never run a state government.
 â€œUnlike some people who offer themselves for president in 2016, you wonâ€™t have to wonder whether I can do it or not,â€\\x9d he said, invoking the â€œeconomic calamityâ€\\x9d he said he inherited in 2010 and the â€œunprecedented natural disaster,â€\\x9d Hurricane Sandy, that he weathered as governor.
 But he reserved his deepest disdain for Congress and for the presidentâ€™s stewardship of foreign affairs, and extended that critique to President Obamaâ€™s former secretary of state.
 â€œAfter seven years of a weak and feckless foreign policy run by Barack Obama, we better not turn it over to his second mate, Hillary Clinton,â€\\x9d Mr. Christie said.
 Still, he blamed both parties for dysfunction and gridlock in Washington. â€œIf Washington and Adams and Jefferson believed that compromise was a dirty word, weâ€™d still be under the crown of England,â€\\x9d he said.
 Mr. Christie, whose dazzling rise as a national Republican in his first term was matched only by his spectacular loss of stature at home in his second, entered the presidential race bearing little resemblance to the candidate he once expected to be.
 The economic recovery he promised has turned into a cascade of ugly credit downgrades and anemic job growth. The state pension system he vowed to fix has descended into a morass of missed payments and lawsuits. The administration he pledged would be a paragon of ethics has instead conspired to mire an entire town in traffic and the governorâ€™s office in scandal.
 Three and a half years ago, Mr. Christie seemed such an antidote to all that ailed the Republican brand that senior figures in the party pleaded with him to run for president as a substitute for the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney.
 But now, a staggering 55 percent of Republican primary voters say that they cannot envision voting for Mr. Christie, according to an NBC-Wall Street Journal Poll. The only candidate less palatable: Donald J. Trump, the bombastic developer turned reality television star.
 With two pillars of his presidential run â€” his record and his judgment â€” looking wobbly, Mr. Christie must now build a campaign around his most raw and prodigious asset: his personality, a magnetic mix of quick-witted charm, insult-trading banter, vulnerability, empathy and effrontery.
 It was on vivid display Tuesday before hundreds of supporters, including many of Mr. Christieâ€™s oldest friends and most loyal aides. He joked about the need for a new and refined tax code that would finally put his father, a certified public account standing nearby, out of business. He described the decision to enter politics as a â€œcoin tossâ€\\x9d between him and his wife, Mary Pat, herself a nimble political mind. And he put an unusual twist on the dilemma facing the financially stretched Social Security system.
 â€œThe lying and stealing has already happened, the horse is out of the barn, we need to get it back in, and the only way to do it is by force,â€\\x9d he said.
 Mr. Christie, 52, honed his political technique, and developed a YouTube following, during a remarkable run of 137 town-hall-style meetings across New Jersey. Not surprisingly, he plans to put the town hall meeting at the center of his candidacy â€” and to put his hopes in a state, New Hampshire, that is famed for its own town hall meetings. He is forgoing the customary tour of early-voting states that usually follows a formal announcement, aides said. Instead, Mr. Christie will plant himself in New Hampshire for a week, holding one town hall after another.
 Such single-mindedness belies the serious and stubborn vulnerabilities of his campaign.
 As a centrist candidate from the Northeast, he would have a difficult path to the Republican presidential nomination under the best circumstances. And circumstances are anything but optimal for him: He faces a wide field of candidates, including several who are better financed and beloved by mainstream donors (Jeb Bush), hold greater appeal to conservative voters who dominate the primary process (Scott Walker), are agile public speakers with persuasive biographies (Mr. Rubio), or are better liked by Republican voters (all of the above).
 At his announcement, Mr. Christie sought political rebirth, as he has before, by relying on his powers as a narrator, and mythologizer, of his own story.
 Running for president is a new and bigger stage, though, and both Mr. Christieâ€™s stagecraft and his oratory showed room for improvement. The first speaker who preceded him to the stage had no microphone, causing a delay; later on, she was booed when she disclosed that she was a Democrat.
 Without a text, Mr. Christie frequently descended into clichÃ©s. â€œThe truth will set us free,â€\\x9d he said at one point. â€œOne person can make a difference,â€\\x9d he said at another.
 But he also spoke with emotional power, as when he recalled his fatherâ€™s early job in an ice cream factory in Newark.
 â€œThink about how amazing this country is,â€\\x9d Mr. Christie said. â€œThat one generation removed from that guy who was working on the floor of the Breyers ice cream plant, his son is the two-term governor of the state that he was born and raised in.â€\\x9d
 The question for Mr. Christie, after a bruising year of watching his story rewritten by others, may be whether Republican voters, who can choose from among a long and intriguing list of fresher faces, will give him a fighting chance to sell himself anew.

TITLE: Chris Christie Announces He's Running For President In 2016

PUBLISHED: 2015/06/30

Chris Christie Announces He's Running For President In 2016
 New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) announced he's running for president in 2016.
 Christie told supporters of his plans in a phone call Tuesday morning, according to NBC and the AP.
 Christie made a public announcement Tuesday afternoon at Livingston High School, his alma mater, in Livingston, New Jersey.
 "I am now ready to fight for the people of the United States of America," Christie said at the public announcement.
 He praised his home state during his speech, sharing how working as governor inspired him to run for president. Christie also took hits at lawmakers in Washington, including President Barack Obama, claiming a lack of productivity from Congress is giving Americans anxiety.
 "Both parties have failed our country... both parties have led us to believe that America, a country that was built on compromise -- that compromise is somehow a dirty word," Christie said.
 "We need to have the courage to choose, we need to have the courage to stand up and say 'enough,'" Christie added.
 Christie, a tough-talking former federal prosecutor whose reputation for political bullying was reinforced by a George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal last year, has served as New Jersey governor since January 2010, winning election twice in a state where Democrats greatly outnumber Republicans.
 He notably led the state during catastrophic damage from Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Christie's favorability rating among voters skyrocketed after he made himself visible through interviews, press conferences and tours of storm damage during the disaster.
 Christie focused on his state rather than the presidential election that took place days after New Jersey's shore was ravaged by the storm. HuffPost reported in November 2012 Christie turned down an invitation to appear at an event with Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney days ahead of the election. Instead, Christie was seen that October praising President Barack Obama for responsiveness and "leadership" in the storm's aftermath.
 In an October 2012 interview with Fox News, Christie said he didn't "give a damn about presidential politics" in the wake of the storm.
 "I have got a job to do here in New Jersey that is much bigger than presidential politics. And I could care less about any of that stuff," Christie said.
 Christie was elected chairman of the Republican Governors Association in November 2013. He worked within that role to raise money and contribute to the campaigns of Republican governors across the U.S., many of whom won in the 2014 midterm elections.
 While serving as chair of the governors association, Christie held prep sessions on foreign policy with officials, business leaders and academics in an attempt to ready himself for a White House run, according The Associated Press.
 Known for his blunt speaking style, Christie has acknowledged that he can come off brash and confrontational.
 "I'm not everybody's cup of tea, but I'm not in this business to get elected to prom king. My job is to lead, and that's what I try to do," Christie said in 2014, according to the AP.
 His image suffered a major blow in 2014, when it was revealed members of his administration, including his deputy chief of staff, were involved in a plot to cause traffic jams near the George Washington Bridge to retaliate against a mayor who hadn't supported Christie's 2013 re-election. Dubbed "Bridgegate," the controversy caused Christie, who had enjoyed high favorability ratings, to see his negatives rise sharply.
 Christie has also faced criticism for reversinghis position recently on Common Core education standards. Christie initially supported the standards but said recently that he no longer supports them because of how they've played out in his state.
 According to HuffPost Pollster, Christie is in the middle of the pack of GOP presidential candidates.

TITLE: Hillary Clinton's use of private email address while secretary of state draws scrutiny

PUBLISHED: 2015/03/03

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton used a personal email account to exclusively conduct official business during her time at the State Department, a move that raises questions about access to the full archive of her correspondence, as well as the possibility that she violated federal law requiring official messages to be retained for the record.
 The existence of the account was discovered by the House select committee investigating the deadly 2012 attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and was first reported by The New York Times.
 Clinton did not even have a government email address during her tenure as America's top diplomat, which lasted from 2009 to 2013, and The Times reports that her aides took no action to preserve her emails on department servers, as required by the Federal Records Act.
 Instead, the paper reports, Clinton's advisers selected which of her emails to turn over to the State Department for archival purposes after going through tens of thousands of pages of correspondence. The department said late Monday that it had received 55,000 pages of Clinton's emails as part of a request made to previous secretaries of state to turn over any official documents they may have had in their possession.
 It is not clear how many total emails from that period were in Clinton's personal account, nor is it clear how Clinton's advisers decided which emails to hand over to the State Department.
 Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, said the former secretary of state expected that emails to State Department officials -- which she sent to department accounts -- would be preserved. "When the Department asked former Secretaries last year for help ensuring their emails were in fact retained, we immediately said yes," he said. "Both the letter and spirit of the rules permitted State Department officials to use non-government email, as long as appropriate records were preserved."
 The fate of emails to foreign leaders, private citizens, and non-State Department officials is unclear.
 "The State Department has long had access to a wide array of Secretary Clinton's records -- including emails between her and Department officials with state.gov accounts," State Department Deputy Spokesperson Marie Harf told Fox News late Monday. Harf added that the department turned over about 300 emails to the Benghazi select committee, and noted that Clinton's successor as secretary of state, John Kerry, "is the first ... to rely primarily on a state.gov email account."
 According to the Times, however, while past secretaries of state often used personal email, updated regulations required such emails to be preserved.
 Clinton and her aides reportedly did not follow that requirement at the time -- until her office turned over documents.
 Republicans seized on the developments on Tuesday. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., former chairman of the House oversight committee, said in a statement that Clinton "failed" to follow records law.
 "The use of a personal e-mail address to skirt public records laws, aside from failing to meet the security standards one would expect of the nation's top diplomat, enabled Clinton to shield her official communications from scrutiny by the media and the American public," he said.
 White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was peppered with questions at Tuesday's briefing.
 He said the administration policy is that employees "should use their official email accounts when they're conducting official government business." He said personal emails also should be preserved and said Clinton's team responded to the request by the department seeking them.
 Earnest would not say whether the White House believes Clinton broke the law.
 Records officials interviewed by The Times expressed grave concern over Clinton's practice, saying it represents a severe ethical breach and noting that personal email accounts are far less secure than official ones.
 Jason Baron, a former director of litigation at the National Archives, told the paper he found it "very difficult to conceive of a scenario â€” short of nuclear winter â€” where an agency would be justified in allowing its cabinet-level head officer to solely use a private email communications channel for the conduct of government business." Baron added that the use of private e-mail accounts is meant to be reserved only for emergencies, such as when a department's server is not working or compromised.
 However, The Times reports that the imposition of penalties for not complying with federal record-keeping requirements are rare because the National Archives has so few enforcement mechanisms.
 The report has drawn heavy criticism from Republicans, including at least one potential challenger in the 2016 presidential race. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who released 250,000 emails from his gubernatorial tenure this past December, tweeted about the contrast between his disclosures and Clinton's secrecy.
 Clinton is widely believed to be the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in 2016. The Wall Street Journal reported late Sunday that she was expected to formally launch her candidacy next month.

TITLE: Marco Rubio to Outline His Approach to Foreign Policy

PUBLISHED: 2015/05/13

The Obama Doctrine is a slightly saltier version of â€œDonâ€™t Do Stupid Stuff.â€\\x9d The Bush Doctrine argued for preventive strikes in the interest of self-defense and national security.
 And on Wednesday, in a speech before the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and a 2016 presidential candidate, will outline his own approach to foreign policy.
 The Rubio approach, according to excerpts from his speech provided by his campaign, has three main pillars â€” ensuring American strength; protecting the American economy in a globalized world; and preserving the moral clarity of Americaâ€™s core values.
 Mr. Rubioâ€™s first priority will be to â€œadequately fundâ€\\x9d the nationâ€™s military. â€œThis would be a priority even in times of peace and stability, though the world today is neither,â€\\x9d Mr. Rubio is expected to say.
 Mr. Rubio, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations and Senate Intelligence committees, has used his time in Congress to burnish his foreign policy credits and cast himself as a defense hawk: a position that could help him stand out in a crowded primary field.
 In his speech, he will promise to use American power â€œto oppose any violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace or outer space,â€\\x9d including the â€œeconomic disruption caused when one country invades another,â€\\x9d according to excerpts.
 And, Mr. Rubio will offer his greater vision of the countryâ€™s broader role in the world.
 â€œAs president, I will support the spread of economic and political freedom, reinforce our alliances, resist efforts by large powers to subjugate their smaller neighbors, maintain a robust commitment to transparent and effective foreign assistance programs, and advance the rights of the vulnerable, including women and the religious minorities that are so often persecuted, so that the afflicted peoples of the world know the truth: The American people hear their cries, see their suffering and most of all, desire their freedom,â€\\x9d he is expected to say.

TITLE: Clinton camp releases candidate's clean bill of health, tax returns

PUBLISHED: 2015/07/31

WASHINGTON â€“ Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign on Friday released a statement from her doctor declaring she is in â€œexcellent physical condition and fit to serve as president of the United States,â€\\x9d along with eight years of tax returns showing the Clintons paid tens of millions of dollars in federal taxes.
 The release comes on the same day the State Department released thousands of emails relating to her tenure as secretary of state.
 In the tax returns, released late Friday afternoon, the documents show the Clintons have paid $43 million in federal taxes since 2007. They also donated $15 million to charity, and paid an additional $13.6 million in state taxes.
 The Clintons' effective federal tax rate for 2014 was 35.7 percent, while the effective tax rate for federal, state and local taxes was 45.8 percent.
 Meanwhile, the statement on her health, from Dr. Lisa Bardack, an internist and chairman of the Department of Medicine at the Mount Kisco Medical Group in Mount Kisco, New York, said the former secretary of state has seasonal pollen allergies and listed "deep vein thrombosis," an elbow fracture and her 2012 concussion in her recent medical history. Following the concussion, a subsequent blood clot developed in her brain.
 As a result, Clinton experienced double vision and wore glasses with a Fresnel prism for two months. During Clintonâ€™s follow-up evaluations, she was found to have a â€œtransverse sinus venous thrombosisâ€\\x9d and started â€œanticoagulation therapyâ€\\x9d to dissolve the clot.
 In 2013, she tested â€œnegativeâ€\\x9d for all clotting disorders, though continues a daily anticoagulation as a precaution, Bardack said.
 Clintonâ€™s current medications also include Armour Thyroid, which is used to treat underactive thyroids, antihistamines and Vitamin B12.
 She doesnâ€™t smoke, drinks occasionally and eats a diet rich in protein. She also exercises regularly, practices yoga, swims, walks and weight trains, her doctor said.
 At her most recent physical on March 21, her blood pressure was 100/65 and her heart rate was 72. Her cholesterol came back at 195, with an LDL of 118, HDL of 64 and triglycerides of 69.
 â€œ(Clintonâ€™s) cancer screening evaluations are all negative,â€\\x9d Bardack added.. â€œShe is in excellent physical condition and fit to serve as president of the United States.â€\\x9d
 Clintonâ€™s camp is touting the fact she is the first 2016 candidate to release any kind of health information, though she only officially released a one-and-a-half-page letter from her doctor.
 Both these releases come as the State Department releases thousands of pages of emails from her time running the department. It was the third major release of Clintonâ€™s email records.
 The State Department has made available several hundred pages of documents in prior releases related to the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and other issues.

TITLE: Hillary Clinton: Obama Should Listen To Nancy Pelosi On Trade

PUBLISHED: 2015/06/14

Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton encouraged President Barack Obama on Sunday to listen to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D) on trade.
 Pelosi took to the House floor Friday to oppose trade legislation Obama had personally lobbied for on Capitol Hill earlier that day.
 â€œWe have an opportunity to slow down,â€\\x9d Pelosi said. â€œWhatever the deal is with other countries, we want a better deal for Americaâ€™s workers.â€\\x9d Following her speech, House Democrats rejected Obama's trade agenda in overwhelming numbers. Obama spent the weekend lobbying members of his party to switch their votes next week.
 At a rally in Iowa, Clinton said that if the president can't come to terms with Pelosi, there should be no deal. "Here's what I think should happen now," Clinton said. "The president should listen to and work with his allies in Congress, starting with Nancy Pelosi, who have expressed their concerns about the impact that a weak agreement would have on our workers, to make sure we get the best, strongest deal possible and if we don't get it, there should be no deal."
 Clinton said she wants to "find out what's in it and make it as good as it can be," and pushed for more transparency "so the American people can actually see what will be in a finalized deal."
 House Democrats rejected Obama's trade agenda Friday by blocking a measure that would have granted him the power to fast-track sweeping, secretive international agreements through Congress.
 Clinton refrained from mentioning trade in her official campaign kickoff speech that took place at New York City's Roosevelt Island on Saturday. Ahead of her remarks in Iowa on Sunday, her campaign said she would not be taking a position on trade until details of a deal were finalized.
 However, Clinton appeared to suggest she would seek to negotiate the trade agreement as president.
 "No president would be a tougher negotiator on behalf of American workers, either with our trading partners or Republicans on Capitol Hill, than I would be," she said.

TITLE: Mike Huckabee Is Running For President

PUBLISHED: 2015/05/05

Mike Huckabee, the Baptist minister who became Arkansas governor, announced Tuesday he'll run for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.
 Huckabee made the announcement in his hometown of Hope, Arkansas.
 "I am a candidate for president of the United States of America," he said.
 During his announcement, Huckabee said that he would "conquer Jihadism" and protect Social Security. He also criticized the Supreme Court for potentially overturning bans on same-sex marriage. He also said that he favored term limits for individuals in all branches of the federal government -- including the judiciary.
 "The Supreme Court is not the supreme being," he said.
 Huckabee, 59, quit his job hosting his own Fox News show, "Huckabee," in January. Last month, he began plotting campaign strategy and hiring staff.
 Huckabee ran for president in 2008. He joins an already crowded 2016 Republican field, and will likely enlist support from the party's far right wing, where he faces competition from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who has positioned himself as a tea party favorite. Huckabee said on CBS's "Face the Nation" last month that he's confident he can broaden his appeal beyond evangelical Christians and social conservatives to reach working-class Republicans concerned about the economy.
 "There's a real sense in the Republican Party that there's no one speaking, not only to them, but speaking for them," Huckabee said then. "And if someone can capture both the blue-collar, working-class Republicans, the conservatives, many of them even union members, as well as evangelicals, there's a real pathway to the nomination."
 Huckabee, an ordained Southern Baptist minister, is a celebrated figure among evangelical Christians. He was the longest-serving Arkansas governor, from 1996 to 2007. He made national headlines for losing more than 110 pounds from 2003 to 2006, and he publicly addressed his struggles with weight. His book, "Quit Digging Your Grave with a Knife and Fork," became a bestseller and he made obesity a major policy initiative as governor.
 He ran for the GOP presidential nomination in 2008, capturing strong support from evangelical Christians and winning the Iowa caucuses. But Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), won most of the subsequent primaries, and Huckabee withdrew from the race that March. His supporters expected him to run again in 2012, but he declined. Since then, he has continued to influence the conservative movement as a charismatic public speaker and radio and television host.
 Huckabee's religion has played a prominent role in his political career and shaped him as a staunch social conservative. He wrote in his memoir, "From Hope to Higher Ground," that his work as a pastor helps him understand how politics and policy affect people.
 "My experience dealing every day with real people who were genuinely affected by policies created by government gave me a deep understanding of the fragility of the human spirit and vulnerability of so many families who struggled from week to week," he wrote. "I was in the ICU at 2 a.m. with families faced with the decision to disconnect a respirator on their loved one; I counseled fifteen-year-old pregnant girls who were afraid to tell their parents about their condition; I spent hours hearing the grief of women who had been physically and emotionally clobbered by an abusive husband."
 As governor, Huckabee signed a ban on gay marriage (which was overturned by a federal judge last year), and he has been outspoken in his opposition against states legalizing marriage equality. Last year, he argued that he's on "the right side of the Bible."
 "You've got to understand, this for me is not about the right side or the wrong side of history, this is the right side of the Bible, and unless God rewrites it, edits it, sends it down with his signature on it, it's not my book to change. Folks, that's why I stand where I stand," he said.
 According to HuffPost Pollster, Huckabee falls behind a few other GOP 2016 candidates, trailing Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.) and Ted Cruz (Texas), and Marco Rubio (Fla.), but slightly edging out former neurosurgeon Ben Carson.

TITLE: Indiana Governor Says Legislators May Clarify Religious Beliefs Law

PUBLISHED: 2015/03/29

Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, moving to address a growing political firestorm over a religious freedom law enacted last week, said over the weekend that he would seek legislation to clarify the intent of the law, and rejected assertions that it sanctioned discrimination against gays and lesbians.
 The governor, a Republican, told The Indianapolis Star on Saturday that he was taken aback by negative reactions to the stateâ€™s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which he signed into law on Thursday. He told the newspaper that he expected legislation clarifying the law to be introduced in the General Assembly this week, but offered no details.
 The law aims to protect individuals or companies from being forced to take actions that impose a substantial burden on their religious beliefs. Proponents say the law should allow Christian vendors to refuse service to same-sex couples without fear of legal reprisals.
 â€œI support religious liberty, and I support this law,â€\\x9d the governor said. â€œBut we are in discussions with legislative leaders this weekend to see if thereâ€™s a way to clarify the intent of the law.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Pence appeared on ABCâ€™s â€œThis Weekâ€\\x9d on Sunday, and the host, George Stephanopoulos, asked him whether signing the law was a mistake.
 â€œAbsolutely not,â€\\x9d Mr. Pence said, adding later: â€œI signed the bill. Weâ€™re going to continue to explain it to people who donâ€™t understand it, and if possible, we will find a way to amplify what this bill really is in the legislative process.â€\\x9d
 But his answers to other questions were less clear. Mr. Pence did not directly answer whether the law might protect, for example, a Christian florist who denied service to a gay couple. Asserting that the legislation was not about discrimination, he said, â€œThe issue here is, you know, is tolerance a two-way street or not?â€\\x9d
 On Saturday, thousands of protesters gathered at the Statehouse as businesses and other governments announced a halt to business with the state and the capital, Indianapolis, over the law.
 Marc Benioff, the chief executive officer of Salesforce.com, said on Thursday that his company would halt all corporate travel to Indiana. On Saturday, Mayor Ed Murray of Seattle announced a ban on city employees traveling to Indiana for work using city funds.
 The same day, Bill Oesterle, the chief executive officer of Angieâ€™s List, said his company would abandon a deal with Indiana and Indianapolis to expand its headquarters. His opposition was seen as an indication of dissatisfaction with the law beyond the liberal political left; he was the campaign director for Mitch Danielsâ€™s successful Republican bid for governor in 2004.
 The debate cast a shadow over preparations in Indianapolis for the N.C.A.A. menâ€™s basketball tournament, which will take place in Indianapolis on Saturday and next Monday. In a statement on Thursday, the N.C.A.A. president, Mark Emmert, said the organization was â€œdeeply concernedâ€\\x9d about the legislation.
 â€œWe intend to closely examine the implications of this bill and how it might affect future events as well as our work force,â€\\x9d he said.
 The backlash has been an unexpected political headache for Mr. Pence, who is juggling whether to run for re-election or for president in 2016.
 Defending the law in the interviews with The Star and Mr. Stephanopoulos, the governor pointed to its origins in federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton and adopted by about 19 other states. Indianaâ€™s bill was drafted from a version that President Obama voted for when he was a state senator in Illinois, Mr. Pence said. Critics, however, say the Indiana law includes different wording that could open the door to wider discrimination.
 Critics also note that in many of the states with similar laws, including Illinois, sexual orientation is protected under civil rights law. In Indiana, gays and lesbians are not a protected class.
 When asked if he would seek those protections, the governor said that he would not. â€œThatâ€™s not on my agenda,â€\\x9d he said on â€œThis Week.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Hillary Clinton Asks State Department to Vet Emails for Release

PUBLISHED: 2015/03/05

WASHINGTON â€” As State Department lawyers sifted last summer through a new batch of documents related to the Benghazi attacks, they repeatedly saw something that caught their attention: emails sent to and from a personal account for Hillary Rodham Clinton.
 The lawyers, according to current and former State Department officials, were working to respond to a request from a specially appointed House committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Libya. But they noticed that among the 15,000 documents they examined, there were no emails to or from an official departmental account for Mrs. Clinton.
 â€œThis all raised the question to us: What else are we missing, and what do we need to complyâ€\\x9d with the request, said one official briefed on the matter.
 Mrs. Clintonâ€™s spokesman and the State Department have cast her decision to hand over her emails as motivated by efforts to update the departmentâ€™s record management system. â€œWhen the department asked former secretaries last year for help ensuring their emails were in fact retained, we immediately said yes,â€\\x9d Nick Merrill, the Clinton spokesman, said on Sunday.
 But it was the review of Benghazi-related documents last summer that, within the State Department, set off the chain of events leading to the public disclosure this week of Mrs. Clintonâ€™s use of a private email account, according to the current and former department officials.
 The decision to ask Mrs. Clinton for her emails went all the way to Secretary of State John Kerryâ€™s chief of staff, who, along with officials working on the response to the Benghazi requests, signed off on it.
 Beginning in August, senior State Department officials held negotiations with Mrs. Clintonâ€™s lawyers and advisers to gain access to her personal email records. At one point, her advisers met face-to-face with department officials in Washington.
 In October, the State Department sent a letter to Mrs. Clinton and all former secretaries of state back to Madeleine K. Albright, seeking emails and other documents in their possession that related to their government work.
 Finally, in December, dozens of boxes filled with 50,000 pages of printed emails from Mrs. Clintonâ€™s personal account were delivered to the State Department. Those documents were then examined by department lawyers, who found roughly 900 pages pertaining to the Benghazi attacks.
 Three weeks ago, the State Department handed over the Benghazi emails to the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which is led by Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina.
 Mrs. Clintonâ€™s spokesman, Mr. Merrill, did not respond to an email seeking comment. A senior State Department official said, â€œIt would be oversimplified and inaccurate to draw the conclusion that the preservation of her records was done for one purpose.â€\\x9d
 Late Wednesday night, two days after The New York Times first reported that she had exclusively used a personal email account as secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton announced that she had asked the State Department to release those communications.
 â€œI want the public to see my email,â€\\x9d Mrs. Clinton wrote in a Twitter post shortly before midnight, addressing the issue publicly for the first time. â€œI asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible.â€\\x9d
 Mrs. Clintonâ€™s decision leaves it to the State Department to determine whether parts of her correspondence should be redacted if they contain information that could be damaging to national security, or for other reasons.
 That process could take several months, officials said, because different parts of the State Department must weigh in on whether information should be redacted. Other government agencies, like the C.I.A. and the Defense Department, may also need to be consulted on any information related to them.
 While the State Department has said there does not appear to be any classified material in Mrs. Clintonâ€™s emails, officials said on Thursday that they needed to go through the trove again to determine whether it contained any â€œsensitiveâ€\\x9d information.
 Sensitive information is different from classified information. It can be personal data, like Social Security numbers, or information on matters that other countries consider classified or important to their national security.
 One State Department official said that if many lawyers were dedicated to the project, it could be completed in several weeks.
 Since the disclosure that Mrs. Clinton used the private account, a spokeswoman for the State Department has described the request from Mrs. Clinton as part of the departmentâ€™s larger efforts to improve its record-keeping. The spokeswoman, Marie Harf, was asked on Tuesday whether there was any connection between the requests from Congress and the decision to ask the former secretaries of state for emails from their personal accounts.
 â€œThe letter actually went before we got the request from the select committee,â€\\x9d Ms. Harf said of the request to the former secretaries. â€œIt went in October of 2014 â€” that was before we had gotten a request from the committee â€” as part of our records-maintenance upgrading and the process we go through.â€\\x9d
 Ms. Harf said that Mrs. Clinton was the only secretary of state who had sent back copies of emails.

TITLE: House Panel Seeks Private Talk With Hillary Clinton About Email

PUBLISHED: 2015/03/31

WASHINGTON â€” The chairman of the House committee investigating the Benghazi attacks asked Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday to appear for a private interview about her exclusive use of a personal email account when she was secretary of state.
 Mrs. Clintonâ€™s â€œemail arrangement with herself is highly unusual, if not unprecedented,â€\\x9d the committeeâ€™s chairman, Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, wrote in a letter to Mrs. Clintonâ€™s lawyer Tuesday morning. He added that Mrs. Clintonâ€™s disclosure last week that all of the emails from the personal account had been deleted â€œonly exacerbates our need to better understand what the secretary did, when she did it and why she did it.â€\\x9d
 The emails were on a server at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y. Mr. Gowdy had asked Mrs. Clinton to turn over that server to a neutral third party, like the State Departmentâ€™s inspector general, to determine which emails were personal and which were government records.
 But in a letter to Mr. Gowdy on Friday, a lawyer for Mrs. Clinton said there was no need to turn over the server because an examination of it showed that it had no copies of emails she sent during her time as secretary of state.
 In October, the State Department asked former secretaries of state dating back to Madeleine Albright to provide it with any government records â€” like emails â€” they might have in their possession. The lawyer for Mrs. Clinton, David Kendall, said that in response to that request, Mrs. Clintonâ€™s representatives had determined which of her roughly 60,000 emails were personal and private. Then, he said, a setting on the email account was changed to retain only messages sent in the previous two months.
 Since the report by The New York Times on March 2 that Mrs. Clinton used only a personal email account and did not even have a government account, she seems to have provided two answers about whether she still has copies of her emails.
 At a news conference at the United Nations a little more than a week after The Timesâ€™s report, Mrs. Clinton first said she â€œchose not to keepâ€\\x9d her private personal emails. But she then said that the server, which contained personal communications of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, â€œwill remain private.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Gowdy said the committee believed that â€œa transcribed interview would best protect Secretary Clintonâ€™s privacy, the security of the information queried and the publicâ€™s interest in ensuring this committee has all information needed to accomplish the task set before it.â€\\x9d
 But Mrs. Clinton indicated on Tuesday that she wanted to give her testimony in a public setting. In a written statement, a spokesman for her said she had told the committee months ago that she was prepared to testify at a public hearing. â€œIt is by their choice that hasnâ€™t happened,â€\\x9d said the spokesman, Nick Merrill. â€œTo be clear, she remains ready to appear at a hearing open to the American public.â€\\x9d
 The committeeâ€™s ranking member, Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, said the panel should hold a public hearing instead of a private interview. â€œRather than drag out this political charade into 2016 and selectively leak portions of a closed-door interview, the committee should schedule the public hearing, make her records public and refocus its efforts on the attacks in Benghazi,â€\\x9d he said.
 Mr. Gowdy has sought to prevent his inquiry into the attacks in 2012 on an American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya â€” and its burgeoning examination of Mrs. Clintonâ€™s email practices â€” from being dismissed as a strictly partisan effort to embarrass a likely Democratic nominee for president. But the time frame in which he is asking Mrs. Clinton to submit to questioning â€” at any time before May 1 â€” coincides with the period in which she is widely expected to make her candidacy official.
 Some Republicans on Capitol Hill â€” including Mr. Gowdy â€” are growing frustrated with Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, who they contend is politicizing the email issue. On Monday, Mr. Priebus said in an appearance on Fox News that Mrs. Clintonâ€™s decision to delete her emails â€œis criminal in nature.â€\\x9d
 â€œI mean, you cannot just destroy documents when an agency is telling you to turn them over,â€\\x9d Mr. Priebus said on â€œFox and Friends.â€\\x9d
 â€œEven Nixon didnâ€™t destroy the tapes,â€\\x9d Mr. Priebus said, referring to the Watergate scandal that ultimately led to President Richard M. Nixonâ€™s resignation. â€œThere are thousands and thousands of emails that are missing.â€\\x9d
 In an interview Tuesday, Mr. Gowdy said Mr. Priebus had overstepped his expertise.
 â€œAs far as I know, heâ€™s not an expert in federal record-keeping law,â€\\x9d Mr. Gowdy said of Mr. Priebus. â€œAnd Iâ€™m 100 percent positive he is not a member of the executive branch, which is charged with investigating and prosecuting under the law.â€\\x9d
 â€œWe donâ€™t know enough facts, so why speculate?â€\\x9d Mr. Gowdy added. â€œWe should keep our conclusions and speculation to a minimum and follow the facts.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Arkansas Governorâ€™s Son Thrust Into Spotlight Over Religious Exception Bill

PUBLISHED: 2015/04/01

When Gov. Asa Hutchinson, Republican of Arkansas, spoke on Wednesday about the future of what proponents call the religious freedom bill pending in his state, he disclosed that the proposal had drawn resistance from a particularly noteworthy critic: his son, Seth Hutchinson.
 But to people familiar with the Hutchinsons, long one of the most influential families in Arkansas, the news was hardly a bombshell.
 â€œIt would be surprising to me if he didnâ€™t do that,â€\\x9d said Shawn Standefer, a childhood friend of the younger Mr. Hutchinson who captained their national championship-winning Quiz Bowl team in high school. â€œHeâ€™s always been concerned with justice, however heâ€™s thought of it.â€\\x9d
 And so it was on Saturday, with lawmakers nearing a vote on the legislation that critics said would legalize discrimination against gay people, that the younger Mr. Hutchinson wrote to his father and warned that the proposal could damage Arkansasâ€™s reputation and economy. It was only the latest chapter in a politically complicated relationship between Asa Hutchinson, a former congressman, and Seth Hutchinson, 31, an organizer for the Texas State Employees Union.
 â€œI love my dad, and we have a good, close relationship,â€\\x9d Seth Hutchinson said on Wednesday. â€œBut we disagree a lot on political issues. This is just another one, but a lot of families disagree politically. But we stay close.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Hutchinson has not always been what he described as the familyâ€™s political â€œblack sheep.â€\\x9d
 â€œI kind of grew up on the campaign trail,â€\\x9d he said. â€œHaving a political opinion just came naturally to me. At first, I pretty much followed the values that my family and my parents laid out for me.â€\\x9d
 But, starting when he was about 15 and working as a dishwasher at a diner, Mr. Hutchinsonâ€™s views began to change as he shuffled through other jobs, including stints at Chuck E. Cheeseâ€™s and Sears. He grew frustrated when he saw older workers enduring financial hardships in low-paying jobs.
 â€œIt just showed me that thereâ€™s something wrong,â€\\x9d he said, adding that he became interested in gay rights at about the same time, when friends began discussing their sexual orientations and after the arrest of an art teacher, who was gay.
 â€œHe was not out,â€\\x9d Mr. Hutchinson said of the teacher. â€œAnd he was arrested in a park â€” I think the official charge was attempting to loiter â€” and it was obvious he was there because he couldnâ€™t be out and keep his job.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Hutchinson had robust political discussions with his father even as a high school student, long before their views diverged so vastly.
 â€œHe would defend his views,â€\\x9d Mr. Standefer said. â€œAnd as they changed, he tried to stand by his new views.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Hutchinson spent a year at Georgetown University before enrolling at the University of Central Arkansas, where he joined groups like the Young Democratic Socialists, and rallied for gay rights during the tenure of another Republican, Gov. Mike Huckabee. He would contact a cousin, Tim C. Hutchinson, who sat in the State House of Representatives, to register his views.
 Seth Hutchinson later moved to Texas and became a labor activist, which the governor mentions to left-leaning audiences.
 Father and son communicate regularly, Seth Hutchinson said, and the family gathers at least once or twice a year.
 â€œItâ€™s always a lively and engaging conversation,â€\\x9d Mr. Hutchinson said.
 On Wednesday, the governor said he would ask lawmakers to either recall or rewrite portions of the bill. Seth Hutchinson, though, refused to take credit.
 â€œI did not sway my dad,â€\\x9d he said. â€œI think my dad is rethinking this because of the pressure thatâ€™s coming at him from all sides.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Clintons Report Earnings of $139 Million in Seven Years

PUBLISHED: 2015/07/31

Hillary Rodham Clinton on Friday released her most recent eight years of tax returns, showing that she and former President Bill Clinton earned $139 million in adjusted gross income from 2007 to 2014. She also released a list of paid speeches showing that she had earned nearly $10 million in speaking fees in 2013, the year she left the State Department.
 The spate of voluntary disclosures on Friday, intended to highlight Mrs. Clintonâ€™s efforts at transparency, came after a week of renewed attention to her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Recent polls suggest that the focus on Mrs. Clintonâ€™s email practices has affected the number of voters who see her as â€œhonestâ€\\x9d and â€œtrustworthy.â€\\x9d
 In a statement, Mrs. Clinton highlighted the millions of dollars she said she and her husband had paid in taxes and given to charity, while lamenting what she called a lopsided tax code that favors wealthy people like them.
 The Clintons have grown immensely better off in the 15 years since they left the White House, primarily through book deals, paid speeches and other business ventures involving Mr. Clinton.
 Mrs. Clinton has devoted a fair amount of time since April, when she began her second presidential campaign, to showing she understands the needs of working-class Americans, who have not seen their wages grow in years, and those struggling in the post-recession job market.
 That effort was made particularly urgent after Mrs. Clinton said last year that she and her husband were â€œdead brokeâ€\\x9d when they left the White House. The remark was widely seized upon by Republicans who argued she was out of touch.
 The Clintons have previously released their tax returns for the period from 1977, when they entered public life, through 2006.
 The new ones show that from 2007 through 2014 the couple paid $43,885,310 in federal taxes, for an effective tax rate of 31.55 percent. They gave nearly $15 million to charity, or an average of 10.8 percent of their earnings. Their charitable deductions ranged from $550,000 in 2008 to more than $3 million in 2007, 2013 and 2014.
 All but $190,450 of their personal charitable giving passed through their philanthropic entity, the Clinton Family Foundation, the returns show. The beneficiaries of that foundation, which files a separate tax return, include their larger foundation ($1.865 million in 2014), as well as the Museum for African Art in New York, the Preventive Medicine Research Institute in California and the American Ireland Fund, based in New York.
 Among Mrs. Clintonâ€™s disclosures Friday was that she was paid $9.68 million in 2013 for 41 speeches, all in the United States except for two in Toronto. She topped out at $400,000 for a speech to the Jewish United Fund/Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Chicago. Her standard rate was $225,000.
 She gave three speeches to Goldman Sachs in 2013 and was paid a total of $675,000 for them; her husband was paid $200,000 by Goldman Sachs for a speech in New York, two days after Mrs. Clinton spoke to the bank in South Carolina, according to an accompanying list of his 2013 speaking fees.
 In all, Mr. Clinton earned $13.17 million in 2013, also for 41 speeches, the most lucrative of these, at $750,000, for addressing Handelsbanken Capital Markets in Stockholm that May; Mr. Clinton listed a second payment of $100,000 from the same company the same day. Fifteen of his speeches were abroad.
 Besides the royalties from his books and his speaking fees, Mr. Clinton earned nearly $20 million between 2011 and 2014 for advising or consulting companies.
 â€œWeâ€™ve come a long way from my days going door to door for the Childrenâ€™s Defense Fund and earning $16,450 as a young law professor in Arkansas â€” and we owe it to the opportunities America provides,â€\\x9d Mrs. Clinton said in her statement.
 Her aides hope to set up a favorable contrast for her with former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, a leading Republican contender, who has argued he is more transparent than she is.
 A month ago, when Mr. Bush released his own tax returns, he said: â€œOne fun fact I learned in this process: I have paid a higher tax rate than the Clintons even though I earned less income.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Bush said his average federal tax rate was 36 percent, and contrasted that with what he said was the Clintonsâ€™ 2014 tax rate: 30 percent. It was unclear where Mr. Bush got the figure.
 Mrs. Clintonâ€™s tax return showed that her 2014 federal tax rate was 35.72, and, with city and state income taxes, was a combined rate of 45.8 percent. Florida has no state income tax.

TITLE: Mike Huckabee on the Issues

PUBLISHED: 2015/05/05

Mike Huckabee, a former Republican governor of Arkansas and preacher who has announced his run for the presidency on Tuesday, has been outspoken on a range of matters, particularly foreign policy and social issues like same-sex marriage. Here are his stances on important issues.
 Mr. Huckabee warns that radical Islam is a grave threat to the United States and says President Obama too frequently defends Islam. He supports forceful military action against the Islamic State.
 A strong defender of Israel, he has been sharply critical of Mr. Obamaâ€™s treatment of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and said a proposed nuclear deal with Iran is â€œterribleâ€\\x9d because Iran cannot be trusted. Mr. Huckabee has talked of the possibility of using military force against Iran.
 As governor of Arkansas in 2002, he called for lifting the economic embargo of Cuba, which would have helped rice farmers in his state. But he now opposes Mr. Obamaâ€™s warming of relations with Havana, calling Cubaâ€™s government tyrannical.
 In 2007 Mr. Huckabee was quoted as saying, â€œClimate change is here, itâ€™s real.â€\\x9d But more recently he has minimized it as a threat, and said he opposes â€œcap and tradeâ€\\x9d legislation meant to curtail carbon emissions. â€œThis kind of mandatory energy policy would have a horrible impact on this nationâ€™s job market,â€\\x9d he said.
 Mr. Huckabee opposes same-sex marriage, suggesting as recently as February that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice akin to drinking or swearing.
 Mr. Huckabee said Mr. Obama exceeded his authority by issuing executive actions shielding millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation. But Mr. Huckabee said the immigrant children whose parents brought them into the country illegally should not be deported because â€œyou donâ€™t punish a child for something his parents did.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Huckabee has focused his economic message on what he calls wage stagnation under Mr. Obama. But the former governor has opposed calls for a higher minimum wage, calling it government intrusion, and he has suggested that policies that encourage a dependency on federal benefits have helped hold wages down.
 Unlike other Republican candidates, Mr. Huckabee is a strong defender of entitlement programs, opposing plans to raise the retirement age for collecting Social Security and criticizing plans to curtail Medicare. Republicans who back such changes, he said, â€œare embracing a government that lied to its people â€” that took money from its people under one pretense and then took it away at the time when they started wanting to actually get what they have paid for all these years.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Hillary Clinton Releases Tax Returns Going Back To 2007

PUBLISHED: 2015/07/31

Hillary and Bill Clinton earned roughly $141 million and paid nearly $44 million in federal income taxes from 2007 to 2014, according to tax returns released Friday.
 The former secretary of state and Democratic presidential candidate released the tax returns on her campaign website, along with her health records and a list of paid speeches she and her husband gave. According to the returns, the Clintons earned $140,937,785 over the eight year span, primarily from book sales and speaking fees. The couple paid $43,885,310 in federal taxes and $13,625,777 in state and local taxes, and made $14,959,450 in charitable contributions during that time.
 Last year, the Clintons paid an effective federal tax rate of 35.7 percent and donated over 10 percent of their income to charity.
 "Weâ€™ve come a long way from my days going door to door for the Childrenâ€™s Defense Fund and earning $16,450 as a young law professor in Arkansasâ€”and we owe it to the opportunities America provides," Clinton said in a statement accompanying the returns. "I want more Americans to have the chance to work hard and get ahead, just like we did. And reforming the tax code can help."
 The Clintons have previously released their tax returns dating back to 1977.
 Clinton's release comes about one month after Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush released 33 years of returns, showing his net worth between $19 and $22 million. Bush paid an effective tax rate of roughly 36 percent over those three decades.
 In May, Hillary Clinton filed a disclosure with the Federal Elections Commission showing the couple had earned approximately $30 million from book sales and speeches in 2014 and the first four months of 2015.

TITLE: Clinton, advisers have lots to say on key trade legislation, except where candidate stands

PUBLISHED: 2015/06/15

Hillary Clinton said Sunday the problems that Congress has with President Obamaâ€™s trade agenda should be an opportunity for the president to ask fellow Democrats about their concerns with the proposal but still declined to say whether she supports or opposes the legislation.
 "Let's take the lemons and turn it into lemonade," Clinton told about 600 supporters at the Iowa State Fairgrounds, addressing the controversial Trans Pacific Partnership trade proposal that has splintered Obama from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and rank-and-file Democrats.
 The legislation would give the president â€œfast-trackâ€\\x9d authority to approve pending trade deals with 11 Pacific Rim nations. The measure also allows Congress to approve or reject such deals, but not amend them.
 Courting Iowa voters, Clinton sought to address Democratic opponents of the trade legislation, including liberals and labor unions, who have said the Obama-backed plan will cost U.S. jobs. The agreement has not been finalized or submitted to Congress.
 "The president should listen to and work with his allies in Congress, starting with Nancy Pelosi, who had expressed their concerns about the impact that a weak agreement would have on our workers to make sure we get the best strongest deal possible," Clinton said. "And if we don't get it, there should be no deal."
 The White House and Republican leaders in Congress now face long odds in trying to revive the trade legislation after congressional Democrats helped defeat a job retraining program to jeopardize Obama's attempt to secure the fast-track authority.
 Clinton appeared to be seeking a middle ground, saying while some support the deal and others vehemently oppose it, "I kind of fall in the group that says â€˜what's in it?â€™ And â€˜let's make it as good as it can be, and then let's make a decision.â€™ â€\\x9d
 She said Obama had an "amazing opportunity" to negotiate better terms and reiterated the criteria of worker protections, wages and national security provisions she would seek in a final deal.
 Clinton said any deal should include the scuttled Trade Adjustment Assistance program to help retrain workers.
 Trade has emerged as an early divider within the Democratic primary.
 Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was campaigning in Iowa on Sunday, has opposed the trade deal and questioned Clinton's refusal to say where she stood.
 "It is a failed trade policy, and I would hope that the Secretary joins Elizabeth Warren, and vast majority of Democrats in the Congress in saying, â€˜No, we've got to defeat this piece of legislation,â€™ â€\\x9d Sanders said on CBS' "Face the Nation."
 Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley has also opposed the deal. In a sign of its resonance within the party, his campaign noted in an email to supporters Saturday that Clinton's speech in New York didn't "weigh in on the secretive TPP deal that could depress American wages and cost American jobs."
 The Obama administration has said it remains confident there are ways to get the trade provisions through Congress.
 Republican leaders generally support Obama's trade proposal and have suggested they may try to revive the bill as early as this week.
 "Republicans delivered," Wisconsin GOP Rep. Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said on "Fox News Sunday." "The question is: Are the Democrats going to do this to their president?"
 While Clinton called the pact the "gold standard" of trade agreements while serving as secretary of state, she has refused to take a position on the deal since announcing her candidacy.
 That brought criticism from Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short on Sunday.
 "By waffling on a trade deal she helped negotiate and once called a "gold standard," Hillary Clinton continues to show why voters overwhelmingly see her as dishonest and untrustworthy," Short said in a statement.
 Clinton was spending most of the weekend in Iowa after formally launching her campaign in New York City, seeking to build an organizational edge in the state that tripped up her first presidential campaign against Obama.
 Sanders was campaigning across the state and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, who is exploring a potential Democratic bid, also was holding events in Iowa on Sunday. O'Malley held a day's events in the state last week.
 Earlier in the day, top Clinton advisers, including senior spokeswoman Karen Finney, said that Clinton is waiting to see the final deal and that she has explained her position in recent weeks.
 "Weâ€™ll see where this process goes," Finney told Fox News. "This is someone who has voted for trade agreements when they have been good for the country and against trade agreements when she thought they were bad for the country."
 Campaign Chairman John Podesta told NBCâ€™s â€œMeet the Pressâ€\\x9d that Clinton â€œhas a clear standard that (the deal) has got to be good for American workers or she thinks the United States should walk away from it.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Benghazi committee seeks 'transcribed' interview with Clinton over deleted records

PUBLISHED: 2015/03/31

The congressional committee probing the Benghazi attacks has formally requested that Hillary Clinton appear for an interview on her use of a personal email and server for official business while secretary of state, after learning the server had been wiped "clean."
 Committee Chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., made the request in a letter sent Tuesday to Clinton's lawyer. Gowdy asked that Clinton agree to a "transcribed" interview -- and repeated a March 16 request for her to surrender her server so it can be examined by the State Departmentâ€™s inspector general.
 Gowdy said Friday that Clinton, the presumptive Democratic front-runner in the 2016 presidential race, has yet to adequately respond to the subpoena request for the server. He said the committee learned she had â€œunilaterally decidedâ€\\x9d to wipe it clean and permanently delete all emails.
 â€œThis committee is left with no alternative but to request Secretary Clinton appear before this committee for a transcribed interview to better understand decisions the secretary made relevant to the creation, maintenance, retention, and ultimately deletion of public records,â€\\x9d Gowdy wrote to Clinton attorney David Kendall on Tuesday.
 Earlier this month, Clinton acknowledged that she sent or received roughly 60,000 related emails, turning over roughly half to the State Department and deleting about the same number of â€œpersonalâ€\\x9d ones.
 The South Carolina Republican set a deadline of May 1 for the interview and restated the committee is interested only in the deleted emails relating to Clintonâ€™s response as secretary of state to the 2012 terror attacks on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, in which four Americans were killed.
 â€œThe committee believes a transcribed interview would best protect Secretary Clintonâ€™s privacy, the security of the information queried, and the publicâ€™s interest in ensuring this committee has all information needed to accomplish the task set before it,â€\\x9d Gowdy also wrote in the letter.
 Gowdy suggested Monday that he wants to have "separate conversations" with Clinton about Benghazi and the emails, in light of her wiping clean the server.
 "I need to ask what she did (with the server) and when she did it and importantly why she did it,â€\\x9d he said on Fox News' "On the Record with Greta Van Susteren."
 He also suggested on the show and in the letter that efforts to get Clinton to comply with the requests might require the full weight of the Republican-led House and that he will confer with House Speaker John Boehner about whether another committee will be involved.
 Clinton has not yet announced a presidential bid.

TITLE: Bernie Sanders Meets President Obama and Pledges to Work to Defeat Donald Trump

PUBLISHED: 2016/06/09

WASHINGTON â€” Senator Bernie Sanders met with President Obama on Thursday and said afterward that he would do everything within his power to stop Donald J. Trump from becoming president â€” and would work closely with Hillary Clinton to make that happen.
 After the meeting with Mr. Obama, which lasted more than an hour, Mr. Sanders gave no indication that he was ready to leave the race just yet, insisting that he would compete in next weekâ€™s primary contest here in Washington. However, he made clear that party unity was on his mind.
 â€œI will work as hard as I can, to make sure that Donald Trump does not become president of the United States,â€\\x9d Mr. Sanders told reporters, saying the Manhattan businessman â€œmakes bigotry and discrimination the cornerstone of his campaignâ€\\x9d and would be a â€œdisasterâ€\\x9d as commander in chief.
 He said he would continue fighting for the issues that animated his campaign, including enhancing Social Security benefits, college affordability and restoring the nationâ€™s crumbling infrastructure.
 â€œThese are the issues that we will take to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July,â€\\x9d Mr. Sanders said, declining to answer reportersâ€™ shouted questions about whether he would leave the race.
 Shortly after their meeting, Mr. Obama endorsed Mrs. Clinton in a video. He also praised the campaign that Mr. Sanders ran.
 The visit came a day after the senator huddled with his team at his headquarters in Vermont to discuss the fate of his candidacy.
 Mr. Sanders, who requested the meeting with the president, pulled into the White House grounds at 10:56 a.m. after stopping at a nearby Peetâ€™s Coffee for a scone. Mr. Obama and Mr. Sanders strolled down the colonnade next to the Rose Garden on their way into the Oval Office, chatting inaudibly and grinning broadly. Nearby, a thick line of cameras and cluster of microphones were assembled in the driveway outside the West Wing, where journalists peppered the Vermont senator with questions.
 Mr. Obama was trying to negotiate, however gently, with him to exit the Democratic race without inflicting damage on efforts to unite the party.
 â€œMy hope is, is that over the next couple of weeks, weâ€™re able to pull things together,â€\\x9d Mr. Obama said during a taping of an appearance on the â€œTonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallonâ€\\x9d on Wednesday in New York. â€œThereâ€™s a natural process of everybody recognizing that this is not about any individual.â€\\x9d
 Briefly posing for photographers before his meeting in the Capitol with Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, Mr. Sanders ignored three questions about Mr. Obamaâ€™s endorsement of Mrs. Clinton.
 His face flushed, Mr. Sanders did not speak at all. But Mr. Reid gently scolded the assembled journalists for asking questions at what was supposed to be just a photo opportunity.
 After his meeting with Reid, Mr. Sanders made a quick exit through a back hall on his way to meet with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York. He was also scheduled to meet with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
 After Mrs. Clinton won Tuesdayâ€™s California primary, Mr. Sanders refused to quit the race, despite Mrs. Clintonâ€™s wide margin of victory and the fact that she had the support of enough delegates for the nomination. But some of his supporters have started to walk away, prompting growing calls that it is time to bring the party together to defeat Mr. Trump.
 On Wednesday, Mr. Sanders sent out a fund-raising email asking for contributions of $2.70, and at 7 p.m. he will hold a rally outside of R.F.K. Stadium in Washington, where he will discuss his plans for getting big money out of politics and making public universities tuition free.

TITLE: Did Ruth Bader Ginsburg Cross The Line With Her Donald Trump Comments?

PUBLISHED: 2016/07/11

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg hasnâ€™t been shy in recent days about the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency, joking that she might move to New Zealand if it ever happens.
 â€œI canâ€™t imagine what this place would be â€• I canâ€™t imagine what the country would be â€• with Donald Trump as our president,â€\\x9d Ginsburg told The New York Times in an article published Sunday. â€œFor the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be â€• I donâ€™t even want to contemplate that.â€\\x9d
 That tracks a comment she made in a separate interview with The Associated Press, when the justice stopped short of noting sheâ€™d rather have presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton making future appointments to the Supreme Court.
 â€œI donâ€™t want to think about that possibility,â€\\x9d Ginsburg said when asked to consider Trump in the role of appointer-in-chief.
 Now a number of legal academics and Supreme Court observers are raising questions about the propriety of Ginsburgâ€™s candor and what it might mean for the courtâ€™s integrity â€• with some suggesting she might have to recuse herself from considering any Trump-related case that reaches the high court.
 â€œThe other justices should hold an intervention, and tell her to be quiet or step down,â€\\x9d wrote Josh Blackman, a Houston College of Law professor who frequently writes about the high court. â€œThis isnâ€™t funny anymore.â€\\x9d He added that Ginsburgâ€™s comments are â€œbeyond the pale.â€\\x9d
 Rick Hasen, another avid court watcher who specializes in election law, wrote that Ginsburgâ€™s statements could very well lead a â€œreasonable personâ€\\x9d to question her impartiality in a future politically charged case.
 â€œI think this is ultimately a question for judicial ethicists, but I do think following these comments it is a legitimate question to raise, should Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign come to the Court with any legal questions before the election,â€\\x9d he wrote in his widely read Election Law Blog.
 Dmitry Bam, a professor at the University of Maine School of Law who has written on judicial recusals and ethics, said â€œthere is little question that she has crossed a line.â€\\x9d
 â€œFor a court that cares a great deal about appearances, this certainly creates the appearance that justices take sides in elections,â€\\x9d Bam wrote in an email. â€œAnd if Trump v. Clinton arises in the fall, I would say that there is at the very least an appearance of bias if Justice Ginsburg participates.â€\\x9d
 Under federal law, justices must step aside from cases where their â€œimpartiality might reasonably be questionedâ€\\x9d â€• and they did so in 180 cases during the courtâ€™s last term, according to a new analysis by Fix the Court, a group that pushes for structural reform at the Supreme Court.
 Fix the Court found that the bulk of recent recusals were due to the justicesâ€™ prior work as appellate judges or in government positions. Other recusals were related to stock ownership and family ties to judges or lawyers who participated in earlier stages of the cases.
 But recusals for political views or implicit support for certain positions are exceedingly rare, even in the face of a code of judicial conduct that guides federal judges on extra-judicial activities and how to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.
 Even with that guidance and other self-imposed checks in place, the justices have time and again declined to step aside in cases of high political salience â€• most recently in the same-sex marriage cases, where Ginsburg and Justices Elena Kagan and Clarence Thomas all took part despite calls for them to recuse.
 â€œIâ€™m not aware [that] any justice before has ever commented on the merits or demerits of a presidential candidate,â€\\x9d said Ed Whelan, the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a frequent contributor to the conservative National Review Online, where he has chronicled this episode and what he deems Ginsburgâ€™s â€œremarkable record of indiscretions.â€\\x9d
 â€œI may very well share her concerns about Donald Trump ... but the ethics concerns donâ€™t depend on the soundness or unsoundness of the candidate,â€\\x9d Whelan added.
 But what if this is less a question about ethics and more about wanting our judges to be candid about their positions and biases â€• and that the political process itself has done away with the veneer that the high court is entirely apolitical?
 â€œMost people now recognize that judges are heavily influenced by their personal beliefs and experiences,â€\\x9d said Bam, of the Maine School of Law.
 â€œWe have watched one party refuse to hold hearings based the politics of the president and his potential nominees. Judges time their retirements to coincide with a certain party being in office. And the 5-4 decision in Bush v. Gore, along partisan lines, also shows the political nature of the court,â€\\x9d Bam said. â€œSo perhaps the pretense that judges are nonpartisan and apolitical does more harm than good.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Vicente Fox, Ex-President of Mexico, Scoffs at Donald Trumpâ€™s Visit

PUBLISHED: 2016/08/31

Donald J. Trump is heading to Mexico on Wednesday to meet with President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto, but one of the Mexican leaderâ€™s predecessors had a different message for the Republican presidential nominee: You are not welcome here.
 Vicente Fox, Mexicoâ€™s president from 2000 to 2006, said on Wednesday that the invitation from Mr. PeÃ±a Nieto was a mistake and that Mr. Trump should never be trusted in the country because of the way he has demonized its people.
 â€œHe is not welcome to Mexico,â€\\x9d Mr. Fox told CNN. â€œWe donâ€™t want him. We reject his visit.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Fox has been critical of Mr. Trumpâ€™s plan to build a wall on the border between the United States and Mexico and on Wednesday he shrugged off recent signs of Mr. Trump softening his plans to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants.
 â€œYou cannot trust a guy like this,â€\\x9d Mr. Fox said. â€œHow can we grant confidence and support to ideas that change everyday? He cynically continues to disregard his own people and disregard Mexicans.â€\\x9d
 Despite Mr. Trumpâ€™s promises that Mexico will pay for his border wall, Mr. Fox vowed in February that it would never happen. He also called Mr. Trump a â€œfalse prophetâ€\\x9d who was misleading his followers.
 On Wednesday, Mr. Fox expressed disbelief that Mr. PeÃ±a Nieto would invite Mr. Trump for the private meeting. He suggested that Mr. Trump was only coming as part of a â€œdesperateâ€\\x9d strategy to improve his sagging poll numbers and in explicit terms he urged Americans not to vote for him.
 â€œI cannot envision him sitting in that chair, that was the chair of President Washington, President Jefferson, President Kennedy, President Reagan,â€\\x9d Mr. Fox said. â€œHe doesnâ€™t know how to run a nation. He doesnâ€™t even know how to run a business.â€\\x9d
 As he prepared to travel to Mexico, Mr. Trump responded to Mr. Foxâ€™s attacks, noting on Twitter that the former Mexican president once suggested that he pay the country a visit.
 Mr. Fox fired back with a Twitter post of his own, reminding Mr. Trump that he invited him to come to Mexico and personally apologize to all Mexicans.
 â€œStop lying!â€\\x9d Mr. Fox wrote. â€œMexico is not yours to play with, show some respect.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Former Mexican President Fox to Trump: We won't pay for 'that f***ing wall!'

PUBLISHED: 2016/02/25

Former Mexican President Vincente Fox made it loud and clear that he wonâ€™t be chipping in for any part of Donald Trumpâ€™s proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
 "Iâ€™m not going to pay for that f***ing wall!â€\\x9d Fox told Jorge Ramos in an interview for Fusion. â€œHe should pay for it. Heâ€™s got the money.â€\\x9d
 While Fox said that he believes that Americans will not elect the real estate tycoon to the White House, he is concerned about the results of the Nevada caucus, in which, according to entrance polls, Trump won 44 percent of the Hispanic vote.
 "I would like to know who those Hispanics are, because they are followers of a false prophet," Fox said. "Heâ€™s going to take them to the desert, and if they think that they will benefit with an administration led by Donald Trump, theyâ€™re wrong. They must open their eyes. Please, you Hispanics in the U.S. â€“ open your eyes."
 Fox added, "It is not to defend our race, it is not to defend our creed, but to defend the same nation that is hosting you. This nation is going to fail if it falls into the hands of a crazy man."
 The former Mexican president, who led the country from 2000 to 2006, also questioned Trumpâ€™s allegiance to the Republican party, or, for that matter, any political party.
 "Heâ€™s not a Republican. Absolutely not,â€\\x9d Fox said. â€œThose are not Republican principles. He is not a Democrat. He is just himself. He is egocentric."
 The comments from Fox echo those of his successor, Felipe CalderÃ³n, who a week ago asserted that Mexico will not pay for a border wall.
 â€œMexican people, we are not going to pay a single cent for such a stupid wall! And it's going to be completely useless,â€\\x9d CalderÃ³n told CNBC.
 For months, Trump has stood by his initial comments about building a border wall and getting Mexico to pay for it. The morning after CalderÃ³n made the comments, the GOP front-runner appeared on MSNBC's "Morning Joe."
 â€œI heard the head of Mexico said â€˜no way,â€™ and I said, â€˜Now the wall just got taller,â€\\x9d Trump said.
 Foxâ€™s interview on Fusion comes about 6 months after Ramos had his own very public skirmish with Trump in which the Spanish-language news icon confronted the billionaire during a press conference in Iowa â€“ prompting the candidate's security team to remove Ramos from the room.
 Ramos later returned and Trump took several of his questions.
 â€œHe tried to silence me,â€\\x9d the Mexican-born journalist told Fox Newsâ€™ Megyn Kelly in August. â€œAnd in this country, you cannot do that. Iâ€™m a citizen. Iâ€™m an immigrant. Iâ€™m a reporter. And I have the right in this country to ask any question I want, to whomever I want.â€\\x9d
 Ramosâ€™ interview with Fox also occurred as U.S. Vice President Joe Biden paid a visit to Mexico for an economic summit. Biden made a thinly-veiled attack on Trump on Thursday, decrying the reality TV starâ€™s "dangerous" rhetoric.
 "Some of the rhetoric coming from some presidential candidates of the other team are, I think, dangerous, damaging and incredibly ill-advised," Biden said, according to AFP. "I'm here to tell you: They do not, they do not, they do not represent the view of the vast majority of the American people.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Paul LePage, the Governor of Maine, Now Says Heâ€™s Not Quitting

PUBLISHED: 2016/08/31

AUGUSTA, Me. â€” Paul R. LePage, the embattled Republican governor of Maine, declared on Wednesday that he would not step down despite widespread criticism over a profane threat and generalizations about drugs and race that had prompted him to hint on Tuesday that he might abort his second term.
 â€œI will not resign,â€\\x9d said Mr. LePage, who tried to put to rest swirling questions about his state of mind.
 â€œIâ€™m not an alcoholic, and Iâ€™m not a drug addict, and I donâ€™t have mental issues,â€\\x9d he said. â€œWhat I have is a backbone.â€\\x9d
 Mr. LePage nevertheless said he was seeking â€œspiritual guidance,â€\\x9d had apologized for his threat, and vowed to make one change to his behavior: â€œI will no longer speak to the press ever again after today,â€\\x9d he said.
 Behind the scenes, state lawmakers â€” Democrats and Senate Republicans â€” exasperated after six years of political controversies and what they saw as erratic behavior, were scrambling to figure out what, if anything, they could do to formally address this latest crisis.
 The controversy, which has galvanized the state, started last Wednesday when Mr. LePage made sweeping statements linking minorities to the stateâ€™s drug crisis. As criticism against him swelled, Mr. LePage came to believe that a Democratic lawmaker had called him a racist. The governor then left him an expletive-laden voicemail message, which he followed up by threatening to shoot the lawmaker between the eyes. In the ensuing days, Mr. LePage also reiterated his insistence that blacks and Hispanics were the vast majority of those arrested for dealing heroin in Maine.
 Both Democrats and Republicans have denounced the remarks, as many legislators called for a special session to at least rebuke the governor over his latest tirade. The stateâ€™s four legislative caucuses have said that they believe all four would have to agree for a special session to be scheduled.
 But on Tuesday, Mr. LePageâ€™s Republican allies in the House, including the minority leader, Kenneth Fredette, announced that they would oppose those efforts â€” essentially shielding him from any official political consequence.
 That decision did not sit well with some other state Republicans, and on Wednesday morning, the spotlight shifted to them as the president of the Senate, whose members govern larger and more competitive districts, made a public break with his colleagues in the House.
 â€œWith all due respect, I completely disagree with Representative Fredetteâ€™s position,â€\\x9d the Republican leader, Michael Thibodeau, said in a statement. â€œThe Republican senate caucus has clearly stated that we need an acceptable plan for corrective action before the determination of whether the Legislature should convene is made.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Thibodeau said many Senate Republicans were still deciding whether or not Mr. LePageâ€™s apology and promise to seek â€œspiritual guidanceâ€\\x9d had allayed their concerns about the governor â€” a process that could deepen their divide with Republicans in the House and pull the controversy into a second week.
 â€œThere should be consequences for our actions,â€\\x9d Mr. Thibodeau said, â€œand I think thatâ€™s why weâ€™re really struggling.â€\\x9d
 There is no precedent for such a situation here â€” a fact that has sent lawmakers like Senator Roger Katz, a Republican who has been critical of Mr. LePage, back to reading their state Constitutions on Wednesday to figure out what, if anything, they could do now to convene a special session. Mr. Katz, a lawyer, suggested it may require only a simple majority of the House and senate, which could reduce the House Republicansâ€™ ability to block such a move, although he added there could be other hurdles to an agreement.
 â€œItâ€™s never been done before, so weâ€™re in a little bit of uncharted waters,â€\\x9d said Mr. Katz, who said he wanted Mr. LePage to get â€œa competent evaluation and follow the recommendations of the evaluator.â€\\x9d
 Democrats have continued to call for Mr. LePageâ€™s ouster, and on Wednesday said they were scheduling meetings with Republican leadership to discuss how to proceed.
 â€œComing back in for a special session will be discussed and all options around the governorâ€™s political future are on the table,â€\\x9d said the Democratic leader of the Senate, Justin Alfond.
 Mr. LePageâ€™s six years in office here, which began as part of the Tea Party sweep in 2010, have been marked by controversy. Even as he fueled outrage among Democrats and angst among many moderate Republicans, his well of support, fed by voters drawn to his unfiltered political style, never seemed to run dry.
 By all indications, Mr. LePage seemed determined to again ride out the political storm.
 â€œI want to put this behind us,â€\\x9d Mr. LePage said, during a meeting with a select group of reporters in his office on Wednesday morning, adding, â€œI will never talk about it again.â€\\x9d
 Mr. LePage spoke shortly after he met with â€” and apologized to â€” Representative Drew Gattine, the state Democratic lawmaker who had been the recipient of the angry voice mail. And in meeting with reporters, Mr. LePage spoke emotionally about Maineâ€™s heroin crisis.
 But he but did not apologize for statements he made last week that linked trafficking in the drug to blacks and Hispanics.
 â€œI didnâ€™t use racially charged language,â€\\x9d Mr. LePage claimed, although he also said, â€œLetâ€™s leave ethnicity out of it.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Nancy Pelosi Re-Elected House Minority Leader

PUBLISHED: 2016/11/30

WASHINGTON â€• House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was re-elected to her leadership post Wednesday morning. But more than 60 Democrats voted against her â€• a stunning level of dissent at a time when the party is trying to pick up the pieces after a disastrous presidential election.
 Pelosi defeated her lone challenger, Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio), by a vote of 134 to 63. Itâ€™s a decisive win, and it (barely) clears the two-thirds majority support that Pelosi predicted she had. But it reveals that dozens in her caucus voted against her in secret ballots. Thatâ€™s a lot.
 â€œThereâ€™s a whole lot of anger,â€\\x9d said one Democrat who opposed her, who requested anonymity in order to speak freely. â€œIâ€™m astounded that this caucus refuses to acknowledge reality and change.â€\\x9d
 Pelosi has led House Democrats since 2003, and thatâ€™s what Ryan had argued is the problem. The same people have been running the caucus for years â€• Pelosi, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (Md.) and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn (S.C.) â€• and theyâ€™re all in their 70s now. Some say theyâ€™re not the right messengers to energize the base and convey an economic message that appeals to people beyond the two coasts.
 House Democrats have also lost nearly 60 seats over the past six years. They picked up just six seats in this election cycle â€• far fewer than expected.
 Pelosiâ€™s supporters said her experience is what the party needs now more than ever, going up against President-elect Donald Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress: Sheâ€™s battle-tested, sheâ€™s a prolific fundraiser and she knows better than anyone how to count votes and keep her party together.
 They say itâ€™s not her fault when Democrats lose at the polls, either.
 â€œYou canâ€™t really blame Nancy Pelosi for gerrymandering and for the national election,â€\\x9d Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) told reporters.
 Sheâ€™s also the only woman in top House and Senate leadership. If Ryan had replaced her, it would have become all white men.
 The California Democrat spoke briefly to reporters after the vote, saying she feels â€œexhilaratedâ€\\x9d at being re-elected.
 â€œToday has a special excitement for me because I think weâ€™re at a time where it is well beyond politics. Itâ€™s about the character of America,â€\\x9d Pelosi said. â€œHow we go forward in our caucus to put forth our values, which are what unite us a caucus, to differentiate between us and the administration that will come into Washington in January, to take that message clearly to the public, is something that is a historic challenge.â€\\x9d
 â€œWe know how to win elections,â€\\x9d she added. â€œWeâ€™ve done it in the past. We will do it again by making that differentiation.â€\\x9d
 Asked about the 63 Democrats who voted for Ryan, Pelosi said, â€œI got two-thirds of the vote.â€\\x9d
 Separately, Ryan told reporters the race didnâ€™t turn out as he wanted but he thinks he did â€œa pretty good jobâ€\\x9d of bringing economic issues to the forefront.
 â€œI think we got the message out,â€\\x9d he said. â€œI believe in my heart, if weâ€™re going to win as Democrats, we have to have the kind of message that resonates in every corner of this country.â€\\x9d
 During the closed-door caucus meeting, several Democrats went to bat for Pelosi. Reps. Adam Schiff (Calif.), Gwen Moore (Wis.), Bill Pascrell (N.J.), Katherine Clark (Mass.), Joaquin Castro (Texas) and Debbie Dingell (Mich.) each gave nominating speeches for her.
 â€œEverything we care about [is] at risk,â€\\x9d Schiff told the room. â€œWe need the very best to lead us. No one is a better tactician than Nancy Pelosi. No one does it better. No one even comes close.â€\\x9d
 Dingell said she has spoken â€œendlesslyâ€\\x9d to Pelosi about appealing to Midwestern voters, and said she gets it. â€œLeader Pelosi always listened and she always understood.â€\\x9d
 Pelosiâ€™s understanding of Midwesterners, or lack thereof, is what Ryan highlighted as the partyâ€™s biggest problem. He said the California progressive has lost the connection with working-class people in the Midwest â€• the same people who make up his district, and the same people who turned out in droves to vote for Trump and help defeat Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton weeks ago.
 â€œWhen you see working-class people, blue-collar people, going and voting for Trump, thatâ€™s a failure of the Democratic Party because they felt like we didnâ€™t care about them,â€\\x9d Ryan said earlier this month. â€œThat just makes my stomach sick.â€\\x9d
 Pelosi did not agree with Ryanâ€™s assessment in a Monday interview with The Huffington Post.
 â€œHe didnâ€™t even carry his district for Hillary Clinton, so I donâ€™t know why heâ€™s saying that,â€\\x9d she said. â€œI have strong support from our friends in the unions, including steelworkers, which I guess are his area ... Iâ€™m a woman of steel in there.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Nancy Pelosi Beats Back House Democratic Leadership Challenge

PUBLISHED: 2016/11/30

WASHINGTON â€” House Democrats on Wednesday rejected appeals that they need new leaders to win back disaffected voters, re-electing Representative Nancy Pelosi of California to an eighth term as House leader over a Rust Belt congressman who said the party had lost its connection to the American working class.
 Ms. Pelosiâ€™s victory over Representative Tim Ryan, a 43-year-old congressman from a blue-collar district anchored in Youngstown, Ohio, ensures that the party will be led in the next Congress by the established â€œcoastalâ€\\x9d Democrats who have increasingly defined it â€” Ms. Pelosi, 76, who represents San Francisco, and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, 66, who has held various leadership posts since 2005.
 The leadership elections, conducted by secret ballot behind closed doors, stamped out calls for new leaders. But while Ms. Pelosi won, 134 to 63, Mr. Ryanâ€™s significant share of the total served as a measure of internal discontent and in some ways a repudiation of Ms. Pelosiâ€™s leadership.
 â€œI think thereâ€™s a lot of soul-searching,â€\\x9d said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney of New York. â€œAnd a lot of really wanting to have a plan.â€\\x9d
 For years, support for Ms. Pelosi has run so deep that few would even consider challenging her. In 2010, after a wave of Tea Party Republicans swept Democrats out of power, she lost just 43 votes.
 Ms. Pelosi, whose victory was mockingly cheered by Republicans as good news for them, dismissed the idea that House Democrats could no longer win with her at the helm. And she vowed that Democrats would continue to stand as a foil to President-elect Donald J. Trumpâ€™s administration.
 â€œWe know how to win elections,â€\\x9d Ms. Pelosi said. â€œWeâ€™ve done it in the past. We will do it again by making that differentiation.â€\\x9d
 Representative Kurt Schrader of Oregon, who backed Mr. Ryan, said after the vote that unless Democrats changed course and adopted â€œa working man and womanâ€™s agenda,â€\\x9d they should expect defeat.
 â€œIâ€™m very worried we just signed the Democratic Partyâ€™s death certificate for the next decade and a half,â€\\x9d Mr. Schrader said.
 Democrats also re-elected Representative Steny H. Hoyer, 77, of Maryland as whip, the No. 2 position, as well as Representative James E. Clyburn, 76, of South Carolina in the No. 3 spot as the assistant Democratic leader. Mr. Hoyer and Mr. Clyburn have been part of the Democratic leadership team since 2003 and 2007. Both ran unopposed.
 Representative Joseph Crowley of New York was also elected chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, and in a narrow victory, 98 to 96, Representative Linda T. SÃ¡nchez of California defeated another California Democrat, Representative Barbara Lee, to become vice chairwoman.
 After a dismal Election Day for Democrats, the fight for Ms. Pelosiâ€™s post had become a proxy battle for the future of the party, with House Democrats agonizing over how to reconnect with the working-class voters who abandoned them.
 â€œWe got wiped out in the Midwest, and weâ€™re toxic in rural America,â€\\x9d aides said Mr. Ryan told his colleagues behind closed doors before the vote. â€œUltimately, weâ€™re responsible.â€\\x9d
 But in an interview Tuesday, Mr. Ryan suggested few ideas for how to appeal to voters beyond essentially crowdsourcing the task to more House Democrats, and he offered no indication that working with the Republican majority on any particular policy compromises would be a priority.
 The Democratic leaders seemed short on concrete strategies, too, committing generally to refocus their message on economic issues. Many also vowed to stand in opposition to the Trump administration, gambling that Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans would disappoint voters and prompt a return to the Democratic Party they rejected.
 Some of the more specific strategies considered included starting a more aggressive recruitment campaign for Democratic candidates from more conservative areas, as well as increasing their outreach to traditionally â€œredâ€\\x9d districts.
 â€œJust because youâ€™re only getting 30 percent of the vote in some area doesnâ€™t mean you shouldnâ€™t go there,â€\\x9d said Representative Cedric L. Richmond of Louisiana. â€œYou should go there and engage people and tell them what you believe in.â€\\x9d
 Disappointed by the outcome of the leadership election, a handful of Democrats who had backed Mr. Ryan vowed to press forward with a proposal to turn some jobs, such as the chairman of the partyâ€™s campaign arm, into elected positions.
 That plan is expected to meet resistance from Ms. Pelosi, who retains the power to appoint people to those positions, though some Democrats have expressed an interest in the idea. Last week Ms. Pelosi selected Representative Ben Ray LujÃ¡n of New Mexico to again lead the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, even though House Democrats picked up just six seats in this election.
 Though he collected only a dozen or so public endorsements, Mr. Ryan mounted an unlikely challenge to Ms. Pelosi, long considered a legislative and fund-raising powerhouse. Driven by the conviction that Democrats need a new leader, he tried to harness discontent with a leadership team that has failed three times to reclaim the majority since being swept out in 2010.
 Trying to quell calls to replace her, Ms. Pelosi announced her nominations last week for a handful of other positions, and proposed that three members from Illinois, Pennsylvania and New York share the leadership duties of the partyâ€™s messaging committee, offering more regional diversity. She also released plans to incorporate more junior members into leadership roles, among other ideas, such as including a freshman Democrat in the leadership teamâ€™s regular meetings.
 But each new idea has underscored the fact that Ms. Pelosi refuses to relinquish much power and has cultivated a large, loyal following that does not expect her to. It is from that sizable collection of House Democrats that she draws her picks for smaller leadership posts, making her a powerful ally and, for those like Mr. Ryan who have challenged her, a formidable opponent.
 â€œShe has a lot of friends,â€\\x9d Mr. Ryan said. â€œThis is her caucus, clearly.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Obama Will Meet With Sanders On Thursday

PUBLISHED: 2016/06/08

WASHINGTON -- With presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton officially reaching the number of delegates required for the nomination, President Barack Obama congratulated her on Tuesday evening, and signaled that the campaign of rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) might be coming to an end.
 According to the White House, Obama spoke to both Clinton and Sanders by phone following Tuesday's primaries and caucuses and will meet with Sanders on Thursday, at Sanders' request.
 "The President congratulated Secretary Clinton for securing the delegates necessary to clinch the Democratic Nomination for President. Her historic campaign inspired millions and is an extension of her lifelong fight for middle-class families and children," White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement.
 "The President thanked Senator Sanders for energizing millions of Americans with his commitment to issues like fighting economic inequality and special interests' influence on our politics."
 Obama will meet with Sanders in Washington on Thursday, the same day the Vermont senator plans to hold a rally there. The meeting was arranged "at Senator Sanders' request," Earnest said, and the two will discuss "how to build on the extraordinary work he has done to engage millions of Democratic voters, and to build on that enthusiasm in the weeks and months ahead."
 Obama has yet to make an endorsement in the race, but White House officials have said that it could come as early as this week.
 In recent months, Obama has privately suggested that Sanders drop out of the race to help Democrats unite around Clinton and prepare for the general election. He has also shown an eagerness to assail presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump, which could be an important asset in helping Clinton defeat Trump in the general election.

TITLE: Ginsburg under fire from both sides over â€˜highly inappropriateâ€™ Trump comments

PUBLISHED: 2016/07/13

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg faced a growing and bipartisan backlash Wednesday -- including a call from Donald Trump to resign -- as she doubled down on her criticism of the presumptive GOP nominee, calling him a â€œfakerâ€\\x9d who is unqualified to be president.
 Even political figures and newspaper editorial writers who might agree with the comments swiftly said they were out of line for a high court justice.
 And Trump himself lashed out on Twitter, saying:
 Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot - resign!
 The liberal icon justice had kicked off the storm with comments to The New York Times published Saturday. â€œI canâ€™t imagine what this place would be â€” I canâ€™t imagine what the country would be -- with Donald Trump as our president. For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be -- I donâ€™t even want to contemplate that,â€\\x9d she said.
 She doubled down late Monday, telling CNN: â€œHe is a faker.â€\\x9d
 "He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego. ... How has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns? The press seems to be very gentle with him on that," she said.
 Trump swiftly responded Tuesday, telling the Times it was â€œhighly inappropriate that a United States Supreme Court judge gets involved in a political campaign.â€\\x9d
 â€œI think itâ€™s a disgrace to the court and I think she should apologize to the court. I couldnâ€™t believe it when I saw it,â€\\x9d the presumptive Republican nominee said.
 Trumpâ€™s criticisms were echoed by Republican congressional leaders. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday Ginsburgâ€™s comments were â€œtotally inappropriate.â€\\x9d
 "It raises a level of skepticism that the American people have from time to time about just how objective the Supreme Court is, whether they're over there to call the balls and strikes, or weigh in on one side or another," he said.
 House Speaker Paul Ryan used similar language at a CNN event Tuesday.
 "For someone on the Supreme Court who is going to be calling balls and strikes in the future based upon whatever the next president and Congress does, that strikes me as inherently biased and out of the realm," Ryan said.
 Ginsburgâ€™s comments also left Democratic lawmakers squirming.
 â€œWe all know that the justices on the Supreme Court have political views. Iâ€™m not sure weâ€™re well served by them airing them out in the open,â€\\x9d Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Politico.
 â€œShe may have got out over her skis a little bit and more forthright and political than she should have been. Itâ€™s very unusual,â€\\x9d Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told the outlet.
 Mainstream media outlets also joined in the chorus of criticism.
 â€œHowever valid her comments may have been, though, and however in keeping with her known political bent, they were still much, much better left unsaid by a member of the Supreme Court,â€\\x9d The Washington Postâ€™s editorial board said Tuesday. â€œPoliticization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts.â€\\x9d
 The board noted the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges says that a â€œjudge should not ... publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office.â€\\x9d
 The New York Times also chimed in: â€œWashington is more than partisan enough without the spectacle of a Supreme Court justice flinging herself into the mosh pit."
 Wednesday morning brought some relief for the under-fire justice, with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders giving qualified support for her comments. While the Democratic presidential candidate declined to comment on whether her comments were appropriate, he said on ABC he agrees Trump is a "total opportunist" and said "the record is quite clear that he lies just a whole lot of the time."

TITLE: Former Mexican President: 'I'm Not Going To Pay For That F**king Wall'

PUBLISHED: 2016/02/25

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox says Mexico will not pay for a wall along the U.S. border, despite what GOP presidential hopeful Donald Trump may claim.
 Fox said, as a taxpayer, heâ€™s not willing to fund Trumpâ€™s big idea.
 â€œIâ€™m not going to pay for that fucking wall,â€\\x9d Fox told Fusionâ€™s Jorge Ramos in an interview airing Thursday. â€œHe should pay [for] it. Heâ€™s got the money.â€\\x9d
 The GOP front-runner, who has made many outrageous comments about Latinos including calling Mexican immigrants "criminals" and "rapists," insists he'll coerce Mexico into paying for a wall to keep undocumented migrants out of the U.S. if he's elected. (The real estate mogul estimates the price tag at around $8 billion.)
 Fox, however, isn't worried that Trump will actually win the presidency.
 "Democracy cannot pick crazy people that doesn't know what's going on in the world today," he said.
 Ramos pointed out that Trump likely won among Hispanics during Tuesdayâ€™s Nevada caucus -- a statistic that has a few caveats.
 "I'd like to know who those Hispanics are," Fox said. "They're followers of a false prophet."
 Felipe Calderon, who was president of Mexico from 2006 to 2012, has also dismissed Trump's idea.
 "Mexican people, we are not going to pay any single cent for such a stupid wall," he said earlier this month. "And it's going to be completely useless. ... If this guy pretends that closing the borders to anywhere either for trade [or] for people is going to provide prosperity to the United States, he is completely crazy."

TITLE: Pelosi wins another term as House Democratic leader; Ryanâ€™s dynamic challenge falls short

PUBLISHED: 2016/11/30

California Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday was appointed to an eighth term as House minority leader, surviving a challenge from a Midwestern Democrat backed by caucus members frustrated over repeated election loses and an aging leadership team.
 Pelosi was challenged by Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan in a secret-ballot vote among House Democrats. She won by a 134-to-63 vote.
 Pelosi said afterward that she was â€œexhilaratedâ€\\x9d by the strong support and reminded reporters that she had accurately predicted winning two-thirds of the vote.
 She has winning brought â€œa special spring in my stepâ€\\x9d because it gives her the opportunity to â€œdifferentiate between us and the administration coming in January."
 Ryan, after a disappointing 2016 election cycle for Democrats, argued that newer lawmakers in the party need a bigger, fresher voice to represent them, instead of the same slate of leaders and committee chairmen.
 He represents northeast Ohio, a region full of the type of disaffected union workers and former Democrats who helped Republican Donald Trump win that battleground state and the White House.
 â€œClearly, this didnâ€™t turn out the way we wanted,â€\\x9d Ryan said after the vote. â€œWe knew it was going to be an uphill battle. â€¦ We needed to get out the economic message. Iâ€™m disappointed, but I think the partyâ€™s better off because of this.â€\\x9d
 Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge, among the handful of House Democrats who backed Ryan's bid, said the effort to unseat Pelosi was not a failure.
 â€œWe didnâ€™t lose today,â€\\x9d she said, interrupting reporters at the post-vote press conference. â€œWe now have a leadership team that listens to us. â€¦ Today, we made our caucus more representative of our members.â€\\x9d
 Another criticism among rank-and-file House Democrats was that the top posts are largely filled by East and West coast members, not those from the heartland.
 Pelosi has led House Democrats since 2002. Democrats lost the House majority in the 2010 Tea Party-inspired wave election. And Republican-led redistricting has made chances of a Democratic comeback increasingly difficult.
 The 76-year-old Pelosi, in the months prior to the Nov. 8 elections, repeatedly vowed that her party would retake control of the lower chamber, despite needing to gain roughly 35 seats.
 â€œWe know how to win elections,â€\\x9d she said Wednesday. â€œWeâ€™ve done it in the past and weâ€™ll do it again. This is so much bigger that politics.â€\\x9d
 Pelosi also described her upcoming role of contrasting Democrats to Republican President-elect Donald Trumpâ€™s incoming administration as a â€œhistoric challengeâ€\\x9d that goes â€œbeyond politics.â€\\x9d
 Leadership elections were originally scheduled to be held before Thanksgiving but were delayed to give Democrats more time to discuss and process the election results and consider a path forward. Many are discouraged after losing the White House and making smaller than expected gains in both chambers of Congress.
 "I believe we must do more than simply paper over the cracks," said Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, one of a handful of House Democrats to endorse Ryan. "We can't just say the right things -- we must take concrete steps to move our party in the right direction."
 In the days before Wednesdayâ€™s vote, Pelosi, a prolific fundraiser, promised some changes to assuage concerns in her caucus, including adding a member of the freshmen class to her leadership team.
 She won despite her proposals doing little to ensure new blood at the very top or changing the seniority system that has key committees led by lawmakers in their 80s at a moment when the party needs to be defending ObamaCare and other initiatives by President Obama.
 Republicans are on track to hold at least 240 seats in the House next year. Democrats, who had high hopes of significant gains in the election, picked up just six seats on Election Day earlier this month and remain in the minority with 194 seats.
 Rep. Loretta Sanchez won the competition for vice Democratic Caucus chairman, defeating fellow California congresswoman Barbara Lee.
 Lee is a former Congressional Black Caucus chairman. Sanchez formerly led the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.
 Democrats until Wednesday had never had a female minority in their leadership ranks.
 â€œIâ€™m really honored and emotional to be standing here among a group of such great leaders,â€\\x9d Sanchez said in second, late-afternoon press conference led by Pelosi.
 Other top leadership posts were uncontested.
 Reps. Steny Hoyer, Maryland, kept the No. 2 job of House minority whip, and Jim Clyburn, South Carolina, remained in No. 3 position of assistant leader.

TITLE: Donald Trump Calls On Obama To Resign Over Orlando Shooting

PUBLISHED: 2016/06/12

Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump issued a bombastic call for President Barack Obama to resign on Sunday over the presidentâ€™s response to a shooting at an Orlando night club that left 50 people dead and scores of others injured.
 "In his remarks today, President Obama disgracefully refused to even say the words 'Radical Islam'. For that reason alone, he should step down. If Hillary Clinton, after this attack, still cannot say the two words 'Radical Islam' she should get out of this race for the Presidency," Trump said in a statement released by his campaign.
 "If we do not get tough and smart real fast, we are not going to have a country anymore. Because our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen â€“ and it is only going to get worse. I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack. We can't afford to be politically correct anymore," the statement continued.
 In their remarks on Sunday, both Obama and Clinton referred to the shooting as an â€œact of terror" and an "act of hate." Obama last year explained that he refuses to describe the self-proclaimed Islamic State and al Qaeda as groups fueled by â€œradical Islamâ€\\x9d because the term grants them a religious legitimacy they donâ€™t deserve.
 Trump noted in his statement that the gunman, Omar Mateen, was "the son of an immigrant from Afghanistan who openly published his support for the Afghanistani Taliban and even tried to run for President of Afghanistan." According to the Washington Post, Seddique Mateen expressed gratitude toward the Afghan Taliban in videos posted online. His son had reportedly pledged allegiance to ISIS before executing the attack, though officials say there is no evidence he had direct ties to the group.
 Trump also criticized Clinton, his presumptive Democratic challenger, for wanting to "dramatically increase admissions" of Syrian refugees into the United States.
 "We need to protect all Americans, of all backgrounds and all beliefs, from Radical Islamic Terrorism - which has no place in an open and tolerant society," Trump said. "Radical Islam advocates hate for women, gays, Jews, Christians and all Americans. I am going to be a President for all Americans, and I am going to protect and defend all Americans."
 In a follow-up tweet posted later Sunday, Trump reiterated his call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States -- even though the Orlando gunman was an American citizen, born in New York. He obtained his weapons legally, despite having been investigated by the FBI several times.
 Trump's campaign said he would be delivering a "major speech" in New Hampshire on Monday that would address "this terrorist attack, immigration, and national security."

TITLE: Paul LePage Says He Won't Resign After All

PUBLISHED: 2016/08/31

Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) said Wednesday that he has no plans to resign, adding that from this day forward, he will no longer talk to the media.
 â€œI will no longer speak to the press ever again after today,â€\\x9d he told reporters Wednesday. â€œAnd Iâ€™m serious. Everything will be put into writing. Iâ€™m tired of being caught in the gotcha moments.â€\\x9d
 LePage has been mired in controversy since calling state Rep. Drew Gattine (D) a â€œson-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksuckerâ€\\x9d in a voicemail last week. After widespread criticism â€• including from members of his own party â€• he apologized.
 LePage hinted on Tuesday that he may resign before his term ends in 2018, telling a local radio station, â€œIâ€™m looking at all options. I think some things Iâ€™ve been asked to do are beyond my ability. Iâ€™m not going to say that Iâ€™m not going to finish it. Iâ€™m not saying that I am going to finish it.â€\\x9d
 He walked back his remarks later that day, criticizing â€œrumorsâ€\\x9d that he was going to resign â€• even though they came directly from LePage himself.
 On Wednesday morning, LePage said unequivocally that he will be staying put.
 â€œI will not resign,â€\\x9d he said after a reconciliation meeting with Gattine, according to the Boston Globe.
 Democrats have been pounding LePage, saying that he needs to step down and questioning his mental abilities. Gattine said after their meeting he believes the governor should resign even though he apologized for the voicemail.
 â€œEvery day, Paul LePage gives Maine people more evidence that he is unfit for office,â€\\x9d State House Majority Leader Jeff McCabe (D) and Assistant House Majority Leader Sara Gideon (D) said in a statement Tuesday night. â€œThe governor is not mentally able to serve and needs to resign.â€\\x9d
 â€œIâ€™m not an alcoholic and Iâ€™m not a drug addict and I donâ€™t have mental issues,â€\\x9d LePage replied Wednesday. â€œWhat I have is a backbone, and I want to move Maine forward.â€\\x9d
 He said he will be seeking â€œspiritual guidanceâ€\\x9d from his family.
 Members of LePageâ€™s own party have been trying to deal with the headaches heâ€™s caused as well, with one GOP state senator even talking about censuring him. State House Minority Leader Ken Fredette (R) said Tuesday night that he would not support bringing the legislature back into a special session to consider sanctions against LePage â€• a position that his counterpart in the Senate wouldnâ€™t back.
 â€œWith all due respect, I completely disagree with Fredetteâ€™s position,â€\\x9d Senate President Mike Thibodeau (R) said Wednesday. â€œThe Republican Senate caucus has clearly stated that we need an acceptable plan for corrective action before the determination of whether the Legislature should convene is made.â€\\x9d
 The latest controversy really dates back to January, when LePage claimed that drug dealers with names like â€œSmoothie, D-Money and Shiftyâ€\\x9d come into Maine and â€œimpregnate a young, white girl before they leave.â€\\x9d Last week, LePage tried to back up that statement â€• which had been widely criticized at the time â€• by saying he keeps a binder of drug dealers arrested in Maine and â€œ90-plus percent of those picturesâ€\\x9d in his book are of black and Hispanic individuals.
 LePage was upset because he mistakenly believed Gattine heard those remarks and called him a racist, and so he left him the voicemail. Gattine denied to the Portland Press Herald that he ever called the governor a racist.
 LePage has long been clear about his distaste for the media. He has said newspapers are his greatest fear and joked about blowing up the headquarters of the Portland Press Herald.

TITLE: Cruz blames Trump for affair story, hints he wouldn't support him in general election

PUBLISHED: 2016/03/25

Sen. Ted Cruz has laid down the gauntlet in the growing war of words with Donald Trump over the Republican presidential candidatesâ€™ wives.
 The Texas lawmaker blamed his rival for the National Enquirer story published Friday that alleged Cruz has had extramarital affairs, and after hits from Trumpâ€™s campaign about the mental health of his wife, the firebrand senator appears to be backing away from his pledge to support Trump if the billionaire real estate mogul wins the GOP nomination.
 â€œI donâ€™t make a habit out of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my family,â€\\x9d Cruz said at a press conference after a Wisconsin rally, according to The Hill.
 He added, â€œDonald Trump is not going to be the Republican nominee.â€\\x9d
 Earlier in the campaign, GOP candidates signed a promise not to run as an independent if they were not nominated. The move was meant to convince voters that Trump would remain faithful to the Republican Party even if he lost.
 â€œIt is garbage, complete and utter lies,â€\\x9d Cruz said about the National Enquirer article alleging that he has had multiple affairs. â€œIt is a tabloid smear, and it has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen.â€\\x9d
 Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson responded to claims that she is one of the mystery women referred to in the article, stating on Twitter that the allegation is â€œstupidity on all levels.â€\\x9d
 â€œOf course the National Enquirer story is 100 percent false!,â€\\x9d Pierson tweeted.
 Of course the National Enquirer story is 100% FALSE!!! I only speak to myself, however.
 Earlier this year, the tabloid endorsed Trump for president with an issue that included an article giving ten reasons why the reality TV star is the â€œonly choice for the White House.â€\\x9d
 The intensely personal feud between Cruz and Trump began earlier this week when a super PAC that opposes Trump posted a meme-style ad featuring a naked Melania Trump that Trumpâ€™s then-girlfriend, a professional model, posed for more that 15 years ago for British GQ.
 Make America Awesome PAC paid for the ads and posted them on Facebook and Instagram.
 The photo features Mrs. Trump sprawled out naked on a fur rug inside a Boeing 727. The social media posts read, â€œMeet Melania Trump. Your next First Lady. Or you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday.â€\\x9d
 An angry Trump lashed out at Cruz on Twitter, calling the senator a liar, as he has alleged before in the campaign, and threatening to â€œspill the beansâ€\\x9d about Cruz's wife Heidi.
 â€œLyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a GQ shoot in his ad,â€\\x9d Trump said on the social media site. â€œBe careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!â€\\x9d
 Cruz quickly retorted by saying that the ads did not come not from his campaign, and called Trump a â€œcowardâ€\\x9d threatening to go after his wife.
 â€œPic of your wife not from us,â€\\x9d Cruz said. â€œDonald, if you try to attack Heidi, you're more of a coward than I thought. #classless.â€\\x9d
 The lurch into the sort of personal territory that's normally off limits in campaigns occurred as an anti-Trump super PAC began running an ad in primary states featuring women reciting comments made by the billionaire that are derogatory toward women.

 Trump has a substantial lead in the delegate chase for the GOP nomination. Cruz has a stiff challenge trying to catch him in remaining races and may only have a shot at the nomination if the contest spills into the summer convention.

TITLE: Obama endorses Clinton for president, on heels of Sanders meeting

PUBLISHED: 2016/06/09

President Obama formally endorsed Hillary Clinton to succeed him in the White House Thursday, saying she has the "courage" for the job and vowing to hit the campaign trail for her soon -- in a video message posted just moments after meeting with her primary rival Bernie Sanders.
 "I know how hard this job can be. Thatâ€™s why I know Hillary will be so good at it," the president said, in the video posted on Clinton's campaign site. "In fact, I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s ever been someone so qualified to hold this office."
 The president made clear he would no longer stand on the sidelines, even as Vermont Sen. Sanders vows to stick out the race at least through the final primary in Washington, D.C., next Tuesday.
 The Clinton campaign separately announced that she and Obama would campaign together June 15 in Green Bay. Clinton tweeted that she's "fired up."
 Presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump immediately fired back.
 To which the Clinton campaign tweeted: â€œDelete your account.â€\\x9d
 Meanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden voiced his support of Hillary Thursday evening at the American Constitution Society's national convention.
 "Anybody who thinks that whoever the next president is -- and God willing, in my view, it will be Secretary Clinton."
 The White House, meanwhile, said Obama recorded the video on Tuesday, the day Clinton effectively wrapped up the nomination.
 The video was released shortly after Obama met in the Oval Office with Sanders.
 Sanders afterward struck a conciliatory tone Thursday, saying he plans to meet soon with Clinton to discuss how they can â€œwork together to defeat Donald Trump.â€\\x9d
 The Vermont senator said he still plans to compete in next Tuesdayâ€™s Washington, D.C., primary, the final contest on the calendar. And he said he plans to take his message â€œto the Democratic National Conventionâ€\\x9d in July.
 He did not, however, say specifically whether he would still be an active candidate by then, taking no questions from the press before heading over to a meeting with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid.
 The meeting with Obama was private. They met for over an hour, and Fox News is told no staff or aides were present.
 But his tone, compared with his defiant speech early Wednesday after Clinton clinched the Democratic nomination, appeared to soften.
 While offering no endorsement himself, Sanders said he spoke with Clinton and congratulated her â€œon her very strong campaign.â€\\x9d
 And Sanders thanked Obama for his â€œimpartialityâ€\\x9d throughout the process. He said he and Vice President Biden lived up to their pledge not to put their â€œthumb on the scales.â€\\x9d
 White House spokesman Josh Earnest later said Sanders has the right to make campaign decisions on his own timeline. Another former primary candidate, ex-Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, did endorse Clinton, saying "it is time now to unite our party."
 Clinton and Obama, along with other party leaders, are eager to bring Sanders â€“ and his supporters â€“ into the fold.
 The president's endorsement reflects their desire to unify as the general election battle between Clinton and presumptive rival Trump intensifies.
 Sanders acknowledged a common political enemy, railing against Trump in his brief remarks to reporters Thursday afternoon and saying heâ€™ll do everything in his power to prevent Trumpâ€™s election.
 As for what he wants, Sanders said heâ€™ll continue to fight what he called the â€œdriftâ€\\x9d toward an oligarchic society. He lamented childhood poverty rates, crushing college debt, crumbling infrastructure and other woes and said these are the issues heâ€™ll bring to the Philadelphia convention.
 Whether that means a fight to overhaul the party platform â€“ or a last-ditch bid to somehow deny Clinton the nomination â€“ remains to be seen.
 One demand Sanders was thought to be considering â€“ as part of a party-unity deal -- is the removal of Democratic boss Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Sanders and the DNC chairwoman have been at odds for months, with Sandersâ€™ team long accusing her of helping now-presumptive nominee Clinton.
 Whether Sanders sought â€“ and the president would even consider â€“ a Schultz sacrifice is unclear.
 â€œI donâ€™t see how she makes it through the convention,â€\\x9d one Democratic lawmaker told Fox News. â€œThe key to Hillary winning is getting Sanders supporters on board.â€\\x9d
 Speculation over Wasserman Schultzâ€™ position has swirled for months, however, and so far she has retained the public support of the White House. Obama also endorsed her earlier this year in her House primary battle.
 Asked Wednesday about the possibility of Sanders seeking her removal, Wasserman Schultz said sheâ€™s not worried about her job.
 â€œI'm going to be remaining as the chair of the Democratic National Committee as President Obama has asked me to do until January 21, 2017, and I appreciate the presidentâ€™s support,â€\\x9d she said.

TITLE: Senate Set to Override Veto on Bill Allowing 9/11 Suits Against Saudi Arabia

PUBLISHED: 2016/09/28

As part of its final bit of business before the election, Congress is set to vote to override President Obamaâ€™s veto of a bill allowing families of those killed in the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia for any role in the terrorist plot.
 The override, the first Mr. Obama has faced in his presidency, is expected to begin in the Senate on Wednesday, followed by the House on Thursday.
 Some lawmakers have been scrambling to try to obviate the veto rejection. But their efforts, which come after both chambers overwhelmingly passed the bill, are almost certain to be futile, and members of both parties have vowed to override the bill.
 Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader who plans to support the override effort, tried on Tuesday to play down any split between Democrats and Mr. Obama. â€œItâ€™s not against the president,â€\\x9d she said. â€œItâ€™s against an idea, an interpretation of the bill.â€\\x9d
 Family members of the victims of the terrorist attacks have pushed for such a measure for years, and they have pressured members of Congress to move ahead with the legislation in the days leading up to the 15th anniversary of the attacks.
 The bill, which Saudi Arabia has fiercely opposed and has hired a phalanx of lobbyists to combat, addresses a 1976 law that gives other countries broad immunity from American lawsuits, amending it to allow for nations to be sued in federal courts if they are found to have played any role in terrorist attacks that killed Americans on home soil. The administration has argued that such a measure would put Americans at legal risk overseas from retaliating nations.

TITLE: Clinton Is 'Sane' And 'Competent,' Unlike Trump, Bloomberg Tells U.S.

PUBLISHED: 2016/07/27

PHILADELPHIA â€• Americans should vote for Hillary Clinton because, unlike Republican nominee Donald Trump, she is a â€œsane, competent person,â€\\x9d Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and founder of the Bloomberg financial news and information empire, said at the Democratic National Convention Wednesday.
 The line was an unscripted addition to a speech in which Bloomberg criticized Democrats, but argued that Trump was a â€œdangerous demagogueâ€\\x9d and a bad businessman who would be a disastrous president. â€œIâ€™m a New Yorker,â€\\x9d he said, â€œand New Yorkers know a con when we see one.â€\\x9d
 The billionaire ex-Republican, who has endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, made the case that Trumpâ€™s career is characterized by a litany of collapses and missteps, and that the Republican presidential nomineeâ€™s boasts donâ€™t match reality. Americans who want a great businessperson in the White House should look for someone who isnâ€™t Trump, Bloomberg said.
 â€œThroughout his career, Trump has left behind a well-documented record of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits, angry stockholders and contractors who feel cheated and disillusioned customers who feel ripped off,â€\\x9d Bloomberg said. â€œTrump says he wants to run the nation like heâ€™s running his business? God help us.
 Bloombergâ€™s scathing speech seemed designed to chafe Trumpâ€™s rawest nerves, mocking Trumpâ€™s business prowess, his inheritance from his late father, his ego and his intellect.
 â€œTruth be told, the richest thing about Donald Trump is his hypocrisy,â€\\x9d Bloomberg said. Trump claims great wealth, but wonâ€™t disclose his real net worth and refuses to release his tax returns. The real-estate developer also reacts defensively when his success is questioned.
 Bloomberg â€• who rivals Trump in unwavering self-assurance â€• favorably compared his own achievements in business and politics with Trumpâ€™s.
 â€œWeâ€™ve heard a lot of talk in this campaign about needing a leader who understands business. I couldnâ€™t agree more. Iâ€™ve built a business â€• and I didnâ€™t start it with a million-dollar check from my father,â€\\x9d Bloomberg said. â€œBecause of my success in the private sector, I had the chance to run Americaâ€™s largest city for 12 years.â€\\x9d
 Bloomberg weighed an independent bid for president this year because he objected to both Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Clintonâ€™s primary challenger. Bloomberg was a vocal critic of the Republican candidate â€• his former friend â€• long before backing Clintonâ€™s White House run.
 The financial industry tycoon ridiculed Trumpâ€™s statements on immigration, national security, foreign trade, and his use of overseas labor. And Bloomberg made dire predictions about the damage a Trump presidency would wreak on virtually every aspect of American life.
 â€œI understand the appeal of a businessman president,â€\\x9d Bloomberg said. â€œBut Trumpâ€™s business plan is a disaster in the making. He would make it harder for small businesses to compete, do great damage to our economy, threaten the retirement savings of millions of Americans, lead to greater debt and more unemployment, erode our influence around the world and make our communities less safe.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Trump gets into Twitter feud with former Mexican president

PUBLISHED: 2016/08/31

Even before Donald Trump landed in Mexico Wednesday, he found himself in a Twitter war with former Mexican President Vicente Fox â€“ who went on a tear declaring the Republican nominee â€œnot welcomeâ€\\x9d in the country.
 Fox, an outspoken critic of Trump, started the fight when he said on CNN that he disagreed with current President Enrique Pena Nietoâ€™s decision to invite the billionaire to the country to meet with him.
 â€œHe is not welcome to Mexico,â€\\x9d Fox told CNN. â€œWe donâ€™t like him. We donâ€™t want him. We reject his visit.â€\\x9d
 "I think President PeÃ±a is taking an enormous political risk by hosting Trump,â€\\x9d he said. â€œHe will even be considered like a traitor because we don't accept to be offended like we just heard, and it should not happen that he comes here with a smile on his face. I think this is a big mistake on the part of President PeÃ±a."
 Trump, as is often his way, fired back on Twitter.
 â€œFormer President Vicente Fox, who is railing against my visit to Mexico today, also invited me when he apologized for using the â€˜f bomb,â€™â€\\x9d he said, referring to when Fox said he wasn't going to pay for "that f-----g wall."
 This triggered a fiery response from Fox, also on Twitter, as he called on Trump to apologize and "stop lying."

TITLE: Bloomberg says Trump a 'dangerous demagogue,' endorses Clinton at DNC

PUBLISHED: 2016/07/27

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg formally endorsed Hillary Clinton Wednesday at the Democratic National Convention, saying it was "imperative" that voters back the former secretary of state over GOP nominee Donald Trump.
 "This is just too important to sit out," said Bloomberg, a former Democrat who won New York's mayoralty as a Republican in 2001 before leaving the party to become an independent six years later.
 "There are times when I disagree with Hillary," Bloomberg said. "But let me tell you, whatever our disagreements may be, Iâ€™ve come here to say we must put them aside for the good of our country."
 Bloomberg, who has an estimated net worth of $48 billion, threw several jabs at Trump, whom he called a "dangerous demagogue" and a "bomb-thrower."
 Bloomberg contrasted his business history with Trump's, saying "Iâ€™ve built a business, and I didnâ€™t start it with a million-dollar check from my father."
 Bloomberg also charged that Trump had "left behind a well-documented record of bankruptcies and thousands of lawsuits and angry shareholders and contractors who feel cheated and disillusioned customers who feel ripped off."
 "Trump says he wants to run the nation like he's running his business? God help us," said Bloomberg, who added that "the richest thing about Donald Trump is his hypocrisy."
 Bloomberg considered making a third-party run for president this year before opting against a campaign, expressing worry he would siphon away votes from Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and inadvertently help elect Trump.
 While in office, Bloomberg had a cordial relationship with Clinton, who, as a senator from New York, was involved in the city's post-9/11 rebuilding effort. He did, as well, with Trump, whom he knew from New York's glitzy social circuit and from dealings with him as a developer.
 But Trump's hardline approach to immigration alienated Bloomberg, who often makes the case that an open immigration policy is needed to keep the nation's economy growing. He deemed Trump's economic plan "a con" and "a disaster in the making."
 Trump did not immediately respond to the speech.

TITLE: Vicente Fox and Felipe CalderÃ³n, 2 Ex-Presidents of Mexico, Say No Way Country Is Paying for Donald Trump's Wall

PUBLISHED: 2016/02/25

At almost all of his campaign rallies, Donald J. Trump leads a familiar refrain as he details his plan to build a giant wall along the border with Mexico.
 â€œWhoâ€™s gonna pay?â€\\x9d he asks.
 Without fail, Mr. Trumpâ€™s adoring fans reply, â€œMexico!â€\\x9d
 While the Mexican government has said little about Mr. Trumpâ€™s plan to beef up border security, two of the countryâ€™s former presidents have a message for Mr. Trump: Mexico wonâ€™t pay.
 â€œIâ€™m not going to pay,â€\\x9d Vicente Fox said, using a profanity to comment about the wall Thursday in an interview with Fusion. â€œHe should pay for it. Heâ€™s got the money.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Fox, who was president of Mexico from 2000 to 2006, was clear in his opposition to Mr. Trump, calling him â€œegocentricâ€\\x9d and lacking in any political values. Mr. Fox also expressed disbelief that Mr. Trump did well with Hispanic voters in the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday and called on them to open their eyes.
 â€œIâ€™d like to know who those Hispanics are,â€\\x9d Mr. Fox said. â€œThey are followers of a false prophet.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Foxâ€™s successor, Felipe CalderÃ³n, expressed similar concerns about the wall this month.
 â€œMexican people, we are not going to pay any single cent for such a stupid wall!â€\\x9d Mr. CalderÃ³n told CNBC. â€œAnd itâ€™s going to be completely useless.â€\\x9d
 Mr. CalderÃ³n, who was president from 2006 until 2012, went on to argue that Mr. Trump was misinformed about the flow of immigrants from Mexico to the United States and that closing the border would harm Americaâ€™s economy.
 For his part, Mr. Trump has insisted that as president he would have the leverage to compel Mexico to pay for the wall, which he estimates would cost about $8 billion.
 On Thursday, however, he appeared to be more angered by Mr. Foxâ€™s tone. Mr. Trump, who has been criticized for lacing his campaign speeches with profanity, called on Mr. Fox to apologize for using foul language when talking about the wall.

TITLE: Donald Trump Rebukes Ruth Bader Ginsburg for Deriding His Candidacy

PUBLISHED: 2016/07/12

Donald J. Trump on Tuesday assailed Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the Supreme Court for speaking out on the presidential race, calling her disdainful remarks about his candidacy â€œhighly inappropriateâ€\\x9d and suggesting that she owed other justices an apology.
 Mr. Trumpâ€™s remarks came in a telephone interview with The Times two days after Justice Ginsburg was quoted as saying she was frightened about what the nation would look like if he were elected.
 â€œI canâ€™t imagine what this place would be â€” I canâ€™t imagine what the country would be â€” with Donald Trump as our president,â€\\x9d Justice Ginsburg told The Times in an interview published Sunday. â€œFor the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be â€” I donâ€™t even want to contemplate that.â€\\x9d She even joked ruefully about moving to New Zealand.
 Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, said he found those remarks unbefitting a member of the high court.
 â€œI think itâ€™s highly inappropriate that a United States Supreme Court judge gets involved in a political campaign, frankly,â€\\x9d Mr. Trump said. â€œI think itâ€™s a disgrace to the court and I think she should apologize to the court. I couldnâ€™t believe it when I saw it.â€\\x9d
 He continued: â€œThat she should be saying that? Itâ€™s so beneath the court for her to be making statements like that. It only energizes my base even more. And I would hope that she would get off the court as soon as possible.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Trump also said he expected to announce his choice of a running mate by Friday, winding down a process that has been closely watched as in all likelihood the most significant decision he will make in his campaign.
 â€œI have five candidates, plus two, two that are unknown to anybody,â€\\x9d Mr. Trump said from Chicago, where he was raising money for his campaign.
 â€œI will be making a decision over the next three- to four-day period of time, and I think it will be a decision that will be a very good decision for a lot of people,â€\\x9d he added.
 Mr. Trump said that he was not basing his vice-presidential selection on fund-raising prowess or potential, and indicated that he had had enough experience with many of those he has been considering for the job that their tryouts on the campaign trail would not necessarily be determinative.
 â€œIâ€™ve been with these people for a long time â€” I know them,â€\\x9d Mr. Trump said, specifically invoking Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker. â€œChristie was excellent yesterday and Newt is excellent.â€\\x9d Mr. Trump will appear on Tuesday night in Indiana with Gov. Mike Pence, who has risen in the estimation of many of the nomineeâ€™s advisers.
 Mr. Trump said his decision was largely coming down to instinct. â€œA lot of is gut. A lot of it is,â€\\x9d he said. â€œMy whole life has been about gut.â€\\x9d
 He also suggested that he would consider polling in states like heavily Democratic Connecticut, which he again said he believed he could put in play in November.
 Asked for quick thoughts about each of the candidates he is known to be considering, Mr. Trump played along.
 Governor Christie? â€œStrong,â€\\x9d he said.
 Retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn? â€œA patriot.â€\\x9d
 Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa? â€œA terrific, exciting person.â€\\x9d
 Governor Pence? â€œSolid as a rock.â€\\x9d
 And Mr. Gingrich? â€œNewt is Newt. Heâ€™s a good guy.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Trump takes on Obama, Clinton over â€˜radical Islamâ€™ as candidates condemn terror

PUBLISHED: 2016/06/13

The terror massacre at a packed Orlando nightclub reverberated across the presidential campaign trail Sunday, as the candidates condemned the deadliest shooting in U.S. history -- and Donald Trump ripped President Obama and Hillary Clinton for avoiding the term â€œradical Islamâ€\\x9d in doing so.
 The presumptive Republican presidential nominee went so far as to say Obama should â€œstep downâ€\\x9d for not using the term and Clinton should â€œget out of this raceâ€\\x9d if she wonâ€™t either.
 â€œIf we do not get tough and smart real fast, we are not going to have a country anymore,â€\\x9d Trump said in a statement. â€œBecause our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen -- and it is only going to get worse. I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack. We can't afford to be politically correct anymore.â€\\x9d
 Obama, speaking from the White House on Sunday, said the nightclub massacre in which 50 people were killed and at least 53 others were wounded is being investigated as an â€œact of terror,â€\\x9d though did not say whether it was tied to radical Islam.
 The gunman, Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, was heard shouting â€œAllahu Akbarâ€\\x9d while engaging officers, law enforcement sources told Fox News.
 Mateen also called 911 during the shooting to pledge allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Fox News has learned.
 ISIS reportedly claimed responsibility for the attack, though itâ€™s unclear if the shooting was actually directed by the group or only inspired by it.
 All these details, surrounding the deadliest terror attack on the U.S. homeland since 9/11, have fueled tensions in the presidential race at an already-combustible time.
 Trump has faced intense criticism from members of both parties for his calls to temporarily ban Muslim immigration to the U.S.
 In the wake of the Orlando attack, Trump again defended his proposals, saying on Twitter: â€œWhat has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough.â€\\x9d
 Trump originally was planning to deliver a speech Monday in Manchester, N.H., focused on the Clintons.
 In the wake of the Orlando attack, it will also focus on security and immigration issues, Fox News is told.
 Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders also condemned the attack, while speaking to reporters outside his home in Burlington, Vt.
 Earlier Sunday, Clinton released a statement unequivocally calling the massacre an â€œact of terror.â€\\x9d
 â€œFor now, we can say for certain that we need to redouble our efforts to defend our country from threats at home and abroad. That means defeating international terror groups, working with allies and partners to go after them wherever they are, countering their attempts to recruit people here and everywhere, and hardening our defenses at home. It also means refusing to be intimidated and staying true to our values,â€\\x9d she said.
 She also called it an â€œact of hateâ€\\x9d -- a term Obama also used -- since the attacker targeted an LGBT nightclub during Pride Month. And she said the country needs to â€œkeep guns like the ones used last night out of the hands of terrorists or other violent criminals.â€\\x9d
 Clinton did not reference radical Islam.
 Meanwhile, a joint campaign rally with Clinton and Obama set for Wednesday in Green Bay, Wis., has been postponed in light of the attack, according to a White House official.
 Obama also ordered U.S. flags to be flown at half-staff â€œas a mark of respect for the victims of the act of hatred and terror perpetrated on Sunday, June 12, 2016, in Orlando, Florida.â€\\x9d
 Florida GOP Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency, which will make additional resources available for local authorities.
 He offered â€œthoughts and prayersâ€\\x9d to all those affected by the attack, particularly the victims and their families, and praised the efforts of the first-responders.

TITLE: Former Mexican President Vicente Fox Slams President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto For Meeting Trump

PUBLISHED: 2016/08/31

Former Mexican President Vicente Fox on Wednesday harshly criticized current President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto for inviting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to meet with him south of the border, just hours before he is due to give a widely anticipated speech on immigration in Arizona.
 â€œHe is not welcome to Mexico,â€\\x9d Fox said in an interview on CNN. â€œBy 130 million people, we donâ€™t like him, we donâ€™t want him. We reject his message.â€\\x9d
 Trump tweeted Tuesday that he had accepted an invitation to meet PeÃ±a Nieto in private. An invitation had also been extended to his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, but the former secretary of stateâ€™s campaign said she was looking forward to speaking with him at the â€œappropriate time.â€\\x9d
 Trump has spent more than a year railing against Mexico and its leaders, promising the country would pay for the construction of a wall on the border it shares with the U.S., as well as fear-mongering about â€œrapistsâ€\\x9d and drug dealers that are coming across it.
 The surprise meeting abroad with a foreign leader will be Trumpâ€™s first as a presidential nominee, and is not without risks to his candidacy. Mitt Romneyâ€™s trip to Israel during the 2012 presidential campaign, for example, did not go over well. PeÃ±a Nietoâ€™s approval rating fell to a record low earlier this year amid several corruption scandals. He, too, may seize on the meeting as an opportunity to bolster his image with Mexicans.
 In his interview on CNN, Fox warned PeÃ±a Nieto would be viewed like â€œa traitorâ€\\x9d if he does not stand up to the GOP nominee.
 â€œTrump is using Mexico, using President PeÃ±a to boost his sinking poll numbers,â€\\x9d Fox said. â€œI think the President PeÃ±a is taking an enormous political risk by hosting Trump. If heâ€™s gone soft on Trump, it will hurt him greatly. He will even be considered like a traitor because we donâ€™t accept to be offended like we just heard, and it should not happen. He comes here with a smile on his face. I think this is a big mistake on part of President PeÃ±a.â€\\x9d
 â€œItâ€™s a very opportunistic move and I hope U.S. public opinion, U.S. citizens can see this and finally, and finally see what is behind Trump, this false prophet that is just cheating everybody,â€\\x9d he added. â€œItâ€™s a desperate move and I donâ€™t see how it can work at all.â€\\x9d
 Earlier this year, Fox railed against Trump in an expletive-laden outburst, promising that Mexico would â€œnever pay for that fucking wall.â€\\x9d He later apologized, and even invited Trump â€œto come to Mexico and to learn about the real Mexico.â€\\x9d
 Trump noted so helpfully in a tweet Wednesday morning.
 â€œFormer President Vicente Fox, who is railing against my visit to Mexico today, also invited me when he apologized for using the â€œf bomb.â€\\x9dâ€\\x9d
 Fox tweeted his own recollection in response:
 â€œ, I invited you to come and apologize to all Mexicans. Stop lying! Mexico is not yours to play with, show some respect.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Congress rejects Obama veto of 9/11 bill, in first override of presidency

PUBLISHED: 2016/09/29

Congress on Wednesday overwhelmingly rejected President Obamaâ€™s veto of a bipartisan bill letting families of Sept. 11 victims sue the Saudi Arabian government, in the first successful veto override of Obamaâ€™s presidency.
 Marking a significant defeat for the White House, the House ensured the bill will become law after voting 348-77 to override Wednesday afternoon. This followed a 97-1 vote hours earlier in the Senate.
 Despite last-ditch warnings from the Obama administration that the legislation could hurt national security and was â€œbadly misguided,â€\\x9d lawmakers dismissed the concerns.
 "This bill is about respecting the voices and rights of American victims," Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said.
 Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., speaking on the Senate floor moments before Wednesday's vote in that chamber, pushed back hard on Saudi government objections to the legislation.
 â€œItâ€™s very simple. If the Saudis were culpable, they should be held accountable. If they had nothing to do with 9/11, they have nothing to fear,â€\\x9d Schumer said.
 Lawmakers in both chambers needed to muster a two-thirds majority to override, and did so easily. The lone "no" vote in the Senate was Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.
 With elections just over a month away, many lawmakers were reluctant to oppose a measure backed by 9/11 families who say they are still seeking justice 15 years after the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. A group of senators pledged to find ways to improve the measure during a post-election, lame-duck session of Congress.
 Despite an expectation that Congress would override, the White House made a last-ditch attempt to fight it. In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Reid, Obama warned the bill could cause chaos in U.S. foreign affairs, as other countries would use the measure to justify the creation of ways to target "U.S. policies and activities that they oppose."
 "As a result, our nation and its armed forces, State Department, intelligence officials and others may find themselves subject to lawsuits in foreign courts." Obama wrote in a letter delivered Tuesday.
 But Cornyn, one of the bill's leading proponents, dismissed Obama's concerns as "unpersuasive." Cornyn, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, and other supporters said the bill is narrowly tailored and applies only to acts of terrorism that occur on U.S. soil.
 The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, moved to the floor of the Senate in May and passed by voice vote. The bill cleared the House earlier this month, also by voice vote.
 Defense Secretary Ash Carter, in a letter Monday to a senior member of Congress, said he's sympathetic to the intent of the measure. But the legislation could lead to the public disclosure of American secrets and even undercut counterterrorism efforts by sowing mistrust among U.S. partners and allies, according to Carter.
 With the override, the bill will now become law. During his nearly two full terms in office, Obama had never had a veto overridden by Congress.
 The legislation gives victims' families the right to sue in U.S. court for any role that elements of the Saudi government may have played in the 2001 attacks. Fifteen of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers were Saudi nationals.
 Courts would be permitted to waive a claim of foreign sovereign immunity when an act of terrorism occurs inside U.S. borders, according to the terms of the bill. Saudi Arabia has objected vehemently to the legislation.
 Obama vetoed the measure last week, telling lawmakers the bill would make the U.S. vulnerable to retaliatory litigation in foreign courts that could put U.S. troops in legal jeopardy.
 But the bill's proponents have disputed Obama's rationale as "unconvincing and unsupportable," saying the measure is narrowly tailored and applies only to acts of terrorism that occur on U.S. soil.
 Kristen Breitweiser, a 9/11 widow and co-chair of September 11th Advocates, criticized Carter's assessment, saying that the defense secretary had testified before Congress last week that he wasn't an expert on the bill.

TITLE: Arguments Get Personal Between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz

PUBLISHED: 2016/03/25

From his home at Mar-a-Lago, Donald J. Trump stirred up new controversy this week in the Republican presidential primary â€” and new alarm among party leaders that the front-runner for the nomination will drive away women from candidates running farther down the ballot in the fall.
 All week, Mr. Trump has slowly escalated a war of words on Twitter against Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, his main competition in the Republican race, based on an ad by a â€œsuper PACâ€\\x9d started by people who want to stop the New York developer from getting the nomination. The spot featured an old nude photo shoot of Mr. Trumpâ€™s wife Melania Trump, a former model, posing on his jet.
 Mr. Cruz has no affiliation with the super PAC, and he has denounced the ad. But Mr. Trump has continued to express disbelief. After threatening to â€œspill the beansâ€\\x9d on Mr. Cruzâ€™s wife, Heidi Cruz, who suffered a bout of depression years ago, he retweeted a post from someone who made a side-by-side photo comparison of Mrs. Cruz at an unflattering angle, and Mrs. Trump.
 On Wednesday, Mr. Cruz repeatedly quoted from the movie â€œThe American Presidentâ€\\x9d to defend his wife, as she held an event and faced questions about Mr. Trumpâ€™s threats. But that was before Mr. Trumpâ€™s Twitter post with the pictures of the two women. And Mr. Cruz had finally had enough.
 Calling Mr. Trump a â€œsniveling coward,â€\\x9d Mr. Cruz told his rival to â€œleave Heidi the hell alone.â€\\x9d
 Itâ€™s useful to remember the news media outrage in 2012 when Todd Akin, running as the Republican nominee for Senate in Missouri, defended what he called â€œlegitimate rape,â€\\x9d a remark that was overwhelmingly offensive to women. Under pressure from news outlets, the Republican Party tried to cauterize the wound that Mr. Akin had created by isolating him.
 Spouses are generally seen as off limits. And the responses to Mr. Trumpâ€™s comments among news media critics, over time, have been far more subdued.

TITLE: Senate Overrides Obama's Veto Of 9/11 Victims Bill

PUBLISHED: 2016/09/28

WASHINGTON â€• In a stinging blow to President Barack Obama, the Senate voted Wednesday to override his veto of a bill to let 9/11 victims sue Saudi Arabia for its alleged role in the terrorist attacks.
 Itâ€™s the first time a chamber of Congress has had the votes to overrule Obama on a veto. Itâ€™s also the result of some unusual alliances: Sen. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), who is on track to become the next Democratic leader, led the effort against the president alongside Sen. John Cornyn (Texas), a conservative member of Republican leadership.
 â€œThis is pretty much close to a miraculous occurrence,â€\\x9d Cornyn said before the vote. â€œAll of us have come together and agreed this is the appropriate and right thing to do.â€\\x9d
 It takes two-thirds of the Senate to override a veto. Party leaders got well above that level. The final tally was 97-1. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) was the lone opposition. Two senators didnâ€™t vote at all: Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who is Hillary Clintonâ€™s vice presidential running mate, and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who was Clintonâ€™s runner-up in the presidential race.
 A Kaine spokesman later told HuffPost that the senator was traveling during the vote, but had he been there, he would have voted to sustain the veto. That puts him on the same page as Clinton, who has said she backs the bill.
 The House voted later on Wednesday to override the veto, causing the bill to become law.
 The bill, known as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, prevents Saudi Arabia and other countries with alleged ties to terrorist groups from invoking their legal immunity in U.S. courts. It overrides the 1976 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which grants immunity to countries that arenâ€™t designated state sponsors of terrorism.
 Fifteen of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 were Saudi citizens, but the Saudi government denies any role in the attacks and multiple U.S. government investigations have cleared it of blame.
 â€œI deeply respect the president and the reasons he has given for vetoing the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act,â€\\x9d Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said ahead of the vote. â€œBut I urge my colleagues to move swiftly and soundly to reverse this veto so that these families can have their day in court.â€\\x9d
 The White House has fought against the bill for months, to no avail. Administration officials warn that it would put Americans overseas at legal risk and leave the United States vulnerable to bogus lawsuits â€• and hefty bills â€• in court systems around the world. The European Union and former top executive branch officials have urged Obama to stop it, in the name of protecting sovereign immunity. Saudi Arabia has threatened to retaliate by selling off hundreds of billions of dollars in American assets.
 But those arguments didnâ€™t sway lawmakers, who say the White Houseâ€™s case is overblown. The bill originally passed the House and Senate without a single â€œnoâ€\\x9d vote.
 â€œThe bill is near and dear to my heart as a New Yorker because it would allow the victims of 9/11 to pursue some small measure of justice,â€\\x9d Schumer said Wednesday. â€œCourts in New York have dismissed their claims against foreign entities alleged to have helped in the 9/11 attacks. They are following an incorrect reading of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.â€\\x9d
 Obama vetoed the bill last week and issued a lengthy statement with it. In sum, he said he sympathizes with 9/11 victims and has expanded efforts to help them, but that JASTA undermines â€œcore U.S. interests.â€\\x9d
 White House press secretary Josh Earnest last week downplayed the significance of Obama getting such a strong rebuke from Congress, including from Democratic leaders.
 â€œThe president is not particularly concerned about that,â€\\x9d Earnest said in his Friday briefing. â€œThis president has gone longer in his tenure in the White House than just about any other president in modern history before facing the prospect of having his veto overridden.â€\\x9d

TITLE: For Trump and Bloomberg, Cordial Ties Have Soured

PUBLISHED: 2016/07/28

Listening to Michael R. Bloomberg rage about Donald J. Trump in his speech at the Democratic National Convention this week â€” labeling him a public menace and hinting that he was not quite sane â€” it would be easy to think that the two billionaires had a rift going back many years.
 â€œTrump says he wants to run the nation like heâ€™s run his business,â€\\x9d Mr. Bloomberg said on Wednesday. â€œGod help us.â€\\x9d
 But in all their time in New York City, their interactions have been limited, yet cordial, according to people who know both of them.
 They existed in different circles of New Yorkâ€™s ultrarich: Mr. Bloomberg is known as a generous philanthropist; Mr. Trump appears to have been flinty in his giving. Mr. Bloomberg is a supporter of the arts and aligns himself with Manhattanâ€™s sophisticated cultural scene; Mr. Trump relishes in being crude.
 Mr. Bloomberg made his billions in finance and technology; Mr. Trump got his start in real estate before becoming a casino magnate and then a reality-show celebrity. Mr. Bloomberg is not overly ostentatious for a man of great wealth; Mr. Trump loves to show off his possessions.
 â€œIâ€™ve been by Mikeâ€™s side for 19 years, and Iâ€™ve never met Donald Trump,â€\\x9d said Kevin Sheekey, an adviser to Mr. Bloomberg, underscoring the extent to which the men were not close. â€œTrump hasnâ€™t been part of the business, political or charitable community since the Koch administration. The only place Mike and Donald would have seen each other is on a golf course or on a TV set.â€\\x9d
 On at least a few occasions, Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Trump met up on the golf links. In 2007, when Mr. Bloomberg was in the second of his three terms as mayor, the two played together in a charity event at Trump National Golf Club in the cityâ€™s northern suburbs. An article in New York magazine described how Mr. Trump, Mr. Bloomberg, the comedian Billy Crystal and the former New York Yankees manager Joe Torre were set to play together in the lead foursome â€” but could not agree on who would go first.
 â€œHow about the mayor starts it off in honor of the city?â€\\x9d Mr. Trump was quoted as saying, playing peacemaker and showing deference to Mr. Bloomberg.
 Mr. Bloomberg also appeared twice on Mr. Trumpâ€™s reality TV show, â€œThe Apprentice,â€\\x9d in 2004 and 2008, in part as a way to demonstrate support for the show, which was produced in New York.
 And the men have a filial connection: acquaintances said that Mr. Bloombergâ€™s daughter Georgina is friends with Mr. Trumpâ€™s daughter Ivanka.
 Mr. Trump, an avid user of Twitter, made positive comments about Mr. Bloomberg when he was in office. â€œMike Bloomberg is doing a great job as mayor of New York City,â€\\x9d he posted in 2012.
 In 2013, he praised Mr. Bloombergâ€™s administration for choosing him to finish a stalled Bronx golf course project, and then wrote on Twitter about a ribbon-cutting with the mayor.
 In 2014, Mr. Trump tweeted congratulations at Georgina for winning an equestrian tournament.
 But the cordiality dissipated not long after Mr. Trump declared his candidacy. Mr. Bloomberg began exploring his own presidential bid, as an independent, in part to block Mr. Trump from being elected. And when Mr. Bloomberg ruled out running, he did so because he said he did not want his third-party candidacy to siphon enough votes to help Mr. Trump.
 â€œAs a former Republican presidential campaign manager told me, Hillary has some baggage, but Trump is crazy,â€\\x9d said Mr. Sheekey, who was involved in Mr. Bloombergâ€™s explorative bid. â€œAnd you canâ€™t fix crazy.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Trump, typically, has not shied away from counterattacks. In a CNN interview in January, Mr. Trump voiced skepticism that Mr. Bloomberg was worth as much as Forbes magazine estimated and speculated that Mr. Bloombergâ€™s company, which provides data terminals to financial firms and wealthy individuals, was vulnerable to competitors.
 â€œWe used to be friends,â€\\x9d Mr. Trump told CNN. â€œI guess weâ€™re not friends anymore.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Maine Gov. LePage opens door to early exit

PUBLISHED: 2016/08/30

Controversial Maine Gov. Paul LePage opened the door Tuesday to making an early exit from the governorâ€™s office following pressure from state lawmakers to step down.
 â€œIâ€™m looking at all options,â€\\x9d LePage said on talk radio station WVOM. â€œI think some things Iâ€™ve been asked to do are beyond my ability. Iâ€™m not going to say that Iâ€™m not going to finish it. Iâ€™m not saying that I am going to finish it.â€\\x9d
 Later in the day, LePage took to Twitter, though, to push back on media reports about a possible resignation.
 During the radio interview, the governor apologized repeatedly for an expletive-ridden voicemail he recently left for Democratic state Rep. Drew Gattine -- the latest controversy to hang over his office.
 Earlier, the Republican governor had refused to apologize for the message, even saying at press conference he wished it was 1825 so he could shoot Gattine in a duel.
 In a recording of the message obtained by the Press Herald, the governor identified himself and went on to curse out Gattine.
 â€œI would like to talk to you about your comments about my being a racist, you c---sucker. I want to talk to you I want you to prove that Iâ€™m a racist. Iâ€™ve spent my life helping black people and you little son-of-a-b----, socialist c---sucker. You â€¦ I need you to, just friggin. I want you to record this and make it public because I am after you. Thank you,â€\\x9d he said in the message.
 LePage initially said his outburst was justified because Gattine called him a racist â€“ something Gattine has denied.
 The alleged name-calling came after LePage said during a town hall that heâ€™s collected a binder full of drug dealers arrested in the state showing that 90 percent of them â€œare black and Hispanic people from Waterbury, Conn.; the Bronx; and Brooklyn.â€\\x9d
 The leaked voicemail prompted members of LePageâ€™s own party to question his ability to lead the state.
 During his news conference Friday, LePage offered more racially charged comments that have drawn fire, saying, "A bad guy is a bad guy. I don't care what color it is. When you go to war ... you try to identify the enemy. The enemy right now, the overwhelming majority of people coming in, are people of color or people of Hispanic origin."
 But this isnâ€™t the first time LePageâ€™s comments have gotten him in trouble.
 The Republican governor has a long history of making controversial statements dating back to 2010 when he said if he were elected governor, heâ€™d tell President Obama to â€œgo to hell.â€\\x9d
 A year later, LePage said that NAACP officials, who had called him out for not attending a Martin Luther King Jr.â€™s event, could â€œkiss my butt.â€\\x9d
 In 2015, LePage was forced to apologize to the son of a cartoonist for The Bangor Daily News because he told him heâ€™d â€œlike to shootâ€\\x9d his father. That same year, a charter school said LePage threatened to strip it of its funding if it did not rescind a job offer to Democratic state House Speaker Mark Eves.
 In January, he said drug dealers with names like â€œD-Money, Smoothie (and) Shiftyâ€\\x9d are getting Maineâ€™s white women pregnant. He later said he had misspoke and meant to say all â€œMaine womenâ€\\x9d not only â€œMaineâ€™s white women.â€\\x9d
 LePageâ€™s second and final term as governor officially ends in 2019.

TITLE: After Nightclub Massacre, Obama Expresses Outrage and a Familiar Lament

PUBLISHED: 2016/06/12

WASHINGTON â€” The tableau at the White House was chillingly familiar: The somber president, nearing the end of his eight-year term, walked grim-faced to the podium to offer his condolences, promised action in the wake of suffering and pleaded for a new resolve that just might prevent more deaths in a hail of bullets.
 The list of tragedies on President Obamaâ€™s watch seems countless by now. An elementary classroom. A church. A military base. A movie theater. And, now, a gay nightclub. Mr. Obama said Sundayâ€™s massacre, by a gunman with a handgun and an assault weapon, is another brutal reminder of how easy it is for someone to slaughter dozens.
 â€œWe have to decide if thatâ€™s the kind of country we want to be,â€\\x9d Mr. Obama said on Sunday as he mourned the nationâ€™s deadliest mass shooting. â€œAnd to actively do nothing is a decision, as well.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Obama vowed to respond forcefully to what he called a devastating â€œact of terror and an act of hate.â€\\x9d This time, it was a tragedy that combined gun violence, a hatred of gays and ties to Islamist terrorism.
 In his remarks, Mr. Obama said it was still unclear to the authorities whether there was a direct link between the gunman and international terrorist groups. But in the hours after he spoke, law enforcement officials said that the gunman had pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State, and they acknowledged that he had twice been investigated for terrorism connections.
 It took only hours for questions about those connections to become fodder in the presidential campaign. Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, seized on the attacks as evidence of Americaâ€™s weakness in facing terrorism. He demanded that Mr. Obama resign because he refused to say the words â€œradical Islamâ€\\x9d in his remarks.
 â€œIf we do not get tough and smart real fast, we are not going to have a country anymore,â€\\x9d Mr. Trump said in a statement. â€œBecause our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen â€” and it is only going to get worse. I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack.â€\\x9d
 Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, called the massacre in Orlando, Fla., an â€œact of terrorâ€\\x9d and an â€œact of hateâ€\\x9d and called for â€œhardening our defenses at homeâ€\\x9d while â€œrefusing to be intimidated and staying true to our valuesâ€\\x9d in the United States.
 Mr. Obama pleaded with Americans during his remarks not to â€œgive in to fear or turn against each other,â€\\x9d a somewhat muted reference to Mr. Trumpâ€™s previous call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States.
 â€œIn the face of hate and violence, we will love one another,â€\\x9d Mr. Obama said. Rather than giving in to fear, the president said, â€œwe will stand united, as Americans, to protect our people, and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us.â€\\x9d
 Speaking to reporters, Mr. Obama said the country had again been traumatized by grievous violence, which shattered more than 100 lives during a three-hour nightmare early Sunday, with 50 people killed and 53 wounded in the attack.
 During his presidency, Mr. Obama has repeatedly mourned victims of mass shootings, often expressing anger and frustration at what he has said is the countryâ€™s apparent willingness to let them become a â€œnormalâ€\\x9d part of life.
 That anger has been compounded by Mr. Obamaâ€™s inability to persuade lawmakers to impose new restrictions on the availability of firearms, especially the assault-style rifles like the one believed to have been used by the gunman in Sunday morningâ€™s attack in Orlando. A major push for a ban on assault weapons after the 2012 massacre of schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn., ended in failure.
 â€œCan we say that weâ€™re truly doing enough to give all the children of this country the chance they deserve to live out their lives in happiness and with purpose?â€\\x9d an emotional Mr. Obama said after the Newtown attack.
 Mr. Obama on Sunday gave his deepest condolences to the families of the victims, and he said Americans should, in particular, keep the countryâ€™s gay and lesbian community in mind as they offer their prayers. He called it an â€œespecially heartbreaking dayâ€\\x9d for the gay community.
 â€œThe shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends, to dance and to sing, and to live,â€\\x9d Mr. Obama said. â€œThe place where they were attacked is more than a nightclub â€” it is a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds and to advocate for their civil rights.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Obama has often hailed the progress on gay rights that has been made during his presidency, especially the decision by the United States Supreme Court to allow same-sex marriage. But those legal protections have not erased hatred in the country.
 â€œThis is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American â€” regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation â€” is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country,â€\\x9d he said.
 Mr. Obama took no questions from reporters after delivering his five-minute remarks. He turned from the podium to walk back into the West Wing, once again left to monitor the investigation, prepare a likely eulogy for the dead and wonder when he might have to come into the briefing room again.
 Shortly after he spoke, Mr. Obama ordered that flags at the White House and other federal sites around the world be lowered to half-staff. Again.

TITLE: Ted Cruz Accuses Donald Trump Of Planting 'Garbage' Affair Story

PUBLISHED: 2016/03/25

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Friday lashed out at Donald Trump, accusing the billionaire of enlisting "his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen to do his bidding."
 The tabloid published a story earlier this week claiming that Cruz had extramarital affairs with five women. Cruz vehemently denied the rumors, which rippled through the Washington media establishment on Friday.
 "I want to be crystal clear: these attacks are garbage," Cruz said Friday in a statement posted on Facebook.
 Earlier in the day, the allegations spilled over into an almost surreal exchange on CNN between Cruz's former communications director Amanda Carpenter and Boston Herald columnist Adriana Cohen, in which Cohen accused Carpenter of having an affair with Cruz. "Youâ€™ve been named as well, Amanda," Cohen said, referring to the National Enquirer piece.
 Trump responded to Cruz's allegations in a statement on Friday afternoon:
 â€œI have no idea whether or not the cover story about Ted Cruz in this week's issue of the National Enquirer is true or not, but I had absolutely nothing to do with it, did not know about it, and have not, as yet, read it. I have nothing to do with the National Enquirer and unlike Lyin' Ted Cruz I do not surround myself with political hacks and henchman (sic) and then pretend total innocence.
 Ted Cruz's problem with the National Enquirer is his and his alone, and while they were right about O.J. Simpson, John Edwards, and many others, I certainly hope they are not right about Lyin' Ted Cruz.â€\\x9d
 While the Enquirer has an infamous reputation for tabloid journalism, it has also broken a number of major sex scandals over the years, including the extramarital affairs of former Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.) and golfer Tiger Woods.
 Reached for comment, a spokesman for American Media Inc., the Enquirer's parent company, also denied that the story had been influenced by Trump backers.
 "No one influences the reporting that The National Enquirer does other than our own reporters and editors. We stand by the integrity of our coverage and remain committed to our aggressive reporting on such an important topic," a spokesman said.

TITLE: F.B.I. 'Destroyed' Flynnâ€™s Life for Lying, Trump Says, but 'Nothing Happened' to Clinton

PUBLISHED: 2017/12/04

WASHINGTON â€” President Trump on Monday said the F.B.I. ruined the life of his former national security adviser and said his Democratic opponent for president, Hillary Clinton, suffered no consequences after she lied â€œmany timesâ€\\x9d to the F.B.I.
 Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trumpâ€™s first national security adviser, pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the F.B.I. when he was questioned early this year about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. He was the fourth person charged in the investigation of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel appointed to lead an inquiry into Russiaâ€™s influence on the 2016 election and possible ties to Trump associates.
 As he left for Utah on Monday, the president said he felt â€œvery badlyâ€\\x9d for Mr. Flynn, whom he fired in February for lying to the vice president about the content of these conversations.
 Mr. Trumpâ€™s comments Monday on Mr. Flynn come at a time when the special counsel investigation is focusing intensely on the presidentâ€™s inner circle. Mr. Trump once encouraged Mr. Flynn to seek an immunity deal. Presidents typically do not weigh in on federal investigations to avoid appearing to influence the outcome.
 â€œI feel badly for General Flynn,â€\\x9d Mr. Trump said on Monday. â€œI feel very badly. Heâ€™s led a very strong life and I feel very badly. Hillary Clinton lied many times to the F.B.I. Nothing happened to her. Flynn lied and they destroyed his life.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Trump did not cite specifically what Mrs. Clinton said that he considered a lie.
 Mrs. Clinton gave a voluntary interview to the bureau in July 2016 during its investigation into whether she or her aides broke the law by corresponding through a private email server set up for her use as secretary of state. A few days later, the F.B.I. director at the time, James B. Comey, recommended no charges be filed against her in the matter.

TITLE: For Now, Trump to Keep Ban on Importing Elephant Trophies

PUBLISHED: 2017/11/17

WASHINGTON â€” President Trump on Friday reversed the governmentâ€™s decision to start allowing hunters to import trophies of elephants that were killed in two African countries, pending a further review.
 His evening Twitter message reversed a decision by his own administration over Zimbabwe that was announced this week and promoted as recently as Friday afternoon by the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
 â€œPut big game trophy decision on hold until such time as I review all conservation facts,â€\\x9d Mr. Trump tweeted. â€œUnder study for years. Will update soon with Secretary Zinke. Thank you!â€\\x9d
 Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, said in a statement later Friday night that the decision applied to two African countries, though it did not name them.
 â€œPresident Trump and I have talked, and both believe that conservation and healthy herds are critical,â€\\x9d the statement said. â€œAs a result, in a manner compliant with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, the issuing of permits is being put on hold as the decision is being removed.â€\\x9d
 The United States Fish and Wildlife Service had signaled its intention to end the 2014 ban, citing Zimbabweâ€™s conservation efforts. On Thursday, the service announced on its website that it would begin issuing permits to allow the import of elephants hunted from 2016 to 2018, with two trophies allowed per import.
 Nearly two weeks ago, the department also waived the ban in a similar manner for Zambia.
 Zambia and Zimbabwe have had mixed success in recent years maintaining or increasing their elephant population, according to the Great Elephant Census, a project financed by Paul G. Allen, a founder of Microsoft. The project also found that the African elephant population shrunk nearly 30 percent from 2007 to 2014.
 It is unclear why Mr. Trump reversed the decision, but the announcement faced backlash from both conservatives and liberals. Laura Ingraham, a Fox News host, said Thursday on Twitter that she did not understand how the decision would not â€œINCREASE the gruesome poaching of elephants,â€\\x9d while the comedian Ellen DeGeneres started an online campaign, using the hashtag #BeKindToElephants, to raise funds for elephant conservation efforts.
 On social media, photos were being shared of Mr. Trumpâ€™s two elder sons hunting on safari in Zimbabwe, including one photo that showed Donald Trump Jr. with a severed elephant tail in one hand and a knife in the other.
 The White House argued that the hunting would bring money to local communities and incentivize efforts to protect elephants. In defending the decision on Friday, Ms. Sanders cited a recently completed Park Service review that had begun during the Obama administration.
 â€œThis review established that both Zambia and Zimbabwe had met new standards, strict international conservation standards that allowed Americans to resume hunting in those countries,â€\\x9d she told reporters during a news briefing.
 Under President Barack Obama, the practice had been banned because of a lack of data on conservation efforts in Zimbabwe.
 Safari Club International, a trophy-hunting organization that sued the Obama administration in 2014 in an effort to challenge the ban and was the first to report the policy change on Tuesday, lashed out against the news media and â€œanti-huntersâ€\\x9d for swaying the Trump administration to lift the trophy ban.
 â€œThe fight for the freedom to hunt is far from over,â€\\x9d Paul Babaz, the organizationâ€™s president, said in a statement. â€œWe will be more proactive and not back down.â€\\x9d
 But environmental groups applauded the reversal on Friday and called for more restrictions on trophy hunting, which has faced increased scrutiny, especially after an American dentist killed Cecil, a lion beloved in Zimbabwe, in 2015.
 â€œItâ€™s great that public outrage has forced Trump to reconsider this despicable decision,â€\\x9d said Tanya Sanerib, a senior lawyer with the Center for Biological Diversity, â€œbut it takes more than a tweet to stop trophy hunters from slaughtering elephants and lions.â€\\x9d
 Ms. Sanders also confirmed Friday that a near-total ban on the commercial trade of African elephant ivory enforced during the Obama administration would remain in place.

TITLE: Lieberman Is a Finalist for F.B.I. Director, Trump Says

PUBLISHED: 2017/05/18

President Trump, 24 hours from his self-imposed deadline for picking a new F.B.I. director, told reporters on Thursday that he was â€œvery closeâ€\\x9d to choosing a successor to James B. Comey, and he named Joseph I. Lieberman, the former Democratic senator and vice-presidential nominee, as a finalist.
 But members of Mr. Trumpâ€™s staff â€” alarmed by his rapid embrace of Mr. Lieberman, a charming 75-year-old political operator with no federal law enforcement experience â€” have quietly urged him to take more time to make such a critical hire. By late Thursday, the president appeared increasingly likely to leave Friday for a nine-day foreign trip without picking a new director, according to three senior administration officials speaking on the condition of anonymity.
 Mr. Lieberman, who served three terms in the Senate as a Democrat and one as an independent, would be an atypical choice to lead the F.B.I., whose agents prize the bureauâ€™s independence as one of Washingtonâ€™s few apolitical institutions. Judges and former prosecutors, not elected officials, have frequently been chosen.
 Administration officials described the search as fluid and said the president and his team were keeping the decision-making process closely held to avoid the leaks that Mr. Trump believes are endemic to the West Wing.
 Still, Mr. Trump, speaking briefly with reporters in the Oval Office as he met with President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia, offered an emphatic â€œyesâ€\\x9d when asked whether Mr. Lieberman was among the finalists.
 â€œWe need a great director of the F.B.I. I cherish the F.B.I. Itâ€™s special,â€\\x9d he told reporters later at a joint East Room news conference with Mr. Santos. â€œAll over the world, no matter where you go, the F.B.I. is special. The F.B.I. has not had that special reputation with what happened in the campaign, what happened with respect to the Clinton campaign, and even, you could say â€” directly or indirectly â€” with respect to the much more successful Trump campaign.â€\\x9d
 It was unclear whether the presidentâ€™s acknowledgment that Mr. Lieberman was a finalist was intended to stoke the â€œApprenticeâ€\\x9d-style frenzy of speculation he has favored with other high-profile picks, only to opt for a lesser-known candidate.
 Mr. Trump is still seeking applicants, and some aides, along with many law enforcement officials, have suggested that he hire from within the agency to repair some of the damage to morale wrought by Mr. Comeyâ€™s sudden firing. Adam S. Lee, the well-regarded special agent in charge of the bureauâ€™s Richmond, Va., field office, was interviewed, as were Richard A. McFeely, a former senior official at the F.B.I., and Andrew G. McCabe, the acting director.
 Mr. McCabe, a veteran agent who joined the bureau in 1996 and once specialized in Russian organized crime, was named deputy director in 2016. It is not clear whether he will return to that role once Mr. Comeyâ€™s replacement is confirmed.
 All three men are under consideration, the administration officials said, even if Mr. Lieberman, who was Al Goreâ€™s running mate in the 2000 presidential campaign, is the front-runner.
 Mr. Trump and Mr. Lieberman had good chemistry when they met privately, one White House aide said â€” a key ingredient for Mr. Trump in hiring people. He is also friendly with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former senator, who has told Trump aides that Mr. Lieberman would most likely receive overwhelming support in the Senate.
 Democrats pushed back hard on that notion, casting the conservative Mr. Lieberman as a Democrat in name only and noting that he publicly supported Mr. Trumpâ€™s pick of Michael T. Flynn as his first national security adviser. At a closed-door Democratic lunch on Thursday, Senators Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois urged party members to hold the line if he is selected.
 But casting Mr. Lieberman as the most likely choice did have one immediate advantage: It appealed to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who had suggested this week that the firestorm over Mr. Trumpâ€™s ouster of Mr. Comey was as bad as Watergate. Mr. McCain defended Mr. Lieberman, who endorsed his 2008 run for president.
 The White House remains divided, and several senior officials expressed serious doubts about Mr. Lieberman. His age, 75, could be problematic, they said, given that F.B.I. directors serve 10-year terms. And he is employed by one of the firms where Marc E. Kasowitz, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, works, raising the prospect of conflict-of-interest accusations.
 If Mr. Trump picks Mr. Lieberman, one adviser said he might serve for a short stint â€” to lend his bipartisan reputation to a president badly in needed of credibility â€” instead of the full term. Mr. Lieberman also has law enforcement experience as the former attorney general of Connecticut.
 Others on Mr. Trumpâ€™s list are former Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma and former Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan, both Republicans. Mr. Rogers, a former F.B.I. agent, was endorsed by the agentsâ€™ association.
 Also interviewed were two other judges, Michael J. Garcia of the New York State Court of Appeals and Henry E. Hudson of Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.

TITLE: Trump holds off reversing ban on elephant trophy imports

PUBLISHED: 2017/11/17

It looks like President Trump is having a change of heart when it comes to his recent decision to lift the ban on importing elephant trophies from Africa.
 In a tweet on Friday night, Trump said he decided to put the "big game trophy decision on hold.â€\\x9d The comment comes less than 48 hours after it was first announced that the Trump administration would reverse a 2014 ban made under President Obama on permits for elephant trophies from Zambia and Zimbabwe.
 Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke echoed Trump's comment in his own tweet, saying that he and the president had spoken and "both believe that conservation & healthy herds are critical...the issuing of permits is put on hold..."
 It was not immediately clear why Trump made the announcement, but it came on the same day as the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee called on the Trump administration to reverse its newly announced policy, labeling it the "wrong move at the wrong time."
 California Rep. Ed Royce on Friday questioned the action because of concerns not only about African wildlife but U.S. national security, citing the political upheaval in Zimbabwe, where the longtime president was placed under house arrest this week by the military.
 "The administration should withdraw this decision until Zimbabwe stabilizes," the committee chairman said in a statement. "Elephants and other big game in Africa are blood currency for terrorist organizations, and they are being killed at an alarming rate. Stopping poaching isn't just about saving the world's most majestic animals for the future â€” it's about our national security."
 Royce said that when carefully regulated, conservation hunts could help the wildlife population, but "that said, this is the wrong move at the wrong time."
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said in a written notice issued Thursday that permitting elephants from Zimbabwe and Zambia to be brought back as trophies will raise money for conservation programs. The change marks a shift in efforts to stop the importation of elephant tusks and hides, overriding a 2014 ban imposed by the Obama administration. The newly announced policy applies to the remains of African elephants killed between January 2016 and December 2018.
 "Legal, well-regulated sport hunting as part of a sound management program can benefit certain species by providing incentives to local communities to conserve those species and by putting much-needed revenue back into conservation," the agency said in a statement.
 The illicit demand for elephant ivory has led to devastating losses from illegal poaching as the natural habitat available for the animals to roam has also dwindled by more than half. As a result, the number of African elephants has shrunk from about 5 million a century ago to about 400,000 remaining. And that number continues to decline each year.
 Two other lawmakers, Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., and Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., co-chairs of the Congressional Animal Protection Caucus, assailed the administration's decision.

TITLE: Trump calls Flynn treatment 'unfair,' claims Clinton 'lied many times' with impunity

PUBLISHED: 2017/12/04

President Trump on Monday called the criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn â€œvery unfair,â€\\x9d claiming he and Hillary Clinton both â€œliedâ€\\x9d to the FBI but only Flynn faced consequences.
 The presidentâ€™s comments, made to reporters as he left Washington for a policy announcement in Utah, saw Trump wading deeper into the Flynn investigation even after a weekend tweet landed the White House in hot water.
 On Monday, Trump said he feels â€œbadlyâ€\\x9d for Flynn, who pleaded guilty on Friday to giving false statements to the FBI about his Russia contacts.
 â€œHillary Clinton lied many times to the FBI, nothing happened to her. Flynn lied and they destroyed his life,â€\\x9d Trump said.
 The president, without offering specifics, said his 2016 Democratic rival â€œlied many timesâ€\\x9d during her FBI interview in early July.
 â€œNothing happened to her. Flynn lied and itâ€™s like they ruined his life. Very unfair,â€\\x9d Trump said, echoing a weekend tweet in which he asked whether a â€œdouble standardâ€\\x9d was at play.
 Clinton was interviewed by FBI agents as part of the investigation into her exclusive use of a private email system while secretary of state.
 After that interview, then-FBI Director James Comey called her actions extremely careless without recommending criminal charges.
 Trump also noted over the weekend that Clinton was not recorded or under oath during that interview.
 On Sunday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., suggested Trump might want to think twice before tweeting and commenting on the Russia case.
 â€œYou tweet and comment regarding ongoing criminal investigations at your own peril,â€\\x9d he said on CBSâ€™ â€œFace the Nation.â€\\x9d
 This was after Trumpâ€™s account tweeted Saturday: â€œI had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI.
 He has pled guilty to those lies.
 It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful.
 There was nothing to hide!â€\\x9d
 That tweet immediately caused problems for the White House, as some legal experts said it potentially exposed the president to obstruction of justice allegations â€“ since, according to the tweet, he would have known Flynn lied to agents when he allegedly asked Comey to lay off the Flynn investigation and later fired Comey.
 Trump said earlier this year that he fired Flynn only for lying to Vice President Pence about the issue.
 Trumpâ€™s personal lawyer John Dowd later said he was the one who wrote that tweet, saying he â€œdid not mean to break news.â€\\x9d
 Dowd attempted to explain Sunday that the tweet was referring to then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates telling White House Counsel Don McGahn in January that Flynn had â€œgiven the agents the same story he gave the vice president.â€\\x9d
 He also said the agents seemed to think Flynn was confused.
 â€œAll the president knew was that the department was not accusing him of lying,â€\\x9d Dowd said.
 Trump over the weekend denied that he asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn.
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said on NBCâ€™s â€œMeet the Pressâ€\\x9d on Sunday that the panel has begun to see "the putting together of a case of obstruction of justice" against Trump.
 Flynn is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s investigators in the Russia meddling case, though itâ€™s unclear what exactly he might reveal about Trump and his associates.

TITLE: Senate intel panel subpoenas two Flynn businesses in Russia probe

PUBLISHED: 2017/05/23

The leaders of the Senate intelligence committee said Tuesday they had subpoenaed two of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's businesses as part of the ongoing probe into Russian activity during last year's presidential campaign.
 Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the top Democrat on the committee, identified the businesses as Flynn Intel Group LLC and Flynn Intel Group Inc., both based in Alexandria, Va.
 The committee's action comes a day after Flynnâ€™s lawyer notified the committee that his client will invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination and not comply with the committeeâ€™s subpoena seeking documents related to its investigation.
 "A business does not have the right to take the fifth," Warner told reporters.
 The investigation focuses on whether Flynn and other Trump associates colluded with Russia to boost the Republican candidate in the 2016 elections.
 Trump fired Flynn in February because he misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had with Russiaâ€™s ambassador about potentially easing economic sanctions.
 Flynn is also being investigated over whether he was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey.
 Intelligence committee chairman Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., said Tuesday that the panel also sent a letter to Flynnâ€™s lawyer questioning whether his client can indeed invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid turning over documents.
 Burr added that if there is no response from Flynn, the committee may consider pursuing a contempt of Congress charge.
 "Everything is on the table," Burr said. Everything but immunity, he added.

TITLE: Republicans prepare to go nuclear with Gorsuch vote as Dems seek new delay

PUBLISHED: 2017/03/22

As Senate Democrats float new options for complicating a vote on President Trumpâ€™s Supreme Court nominee, Republicans appear ready to return fire with a bomb of their own â€“ a nuclear one.
 Top Republican Sen. John Thune, of South Dakota, all but confirmed Wednesday that his party is willing to use whatâ€™s known as the â€œnuclear option,â€\\x9d to lower the vote threshold to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch if Democrats try to filibuster.
 â€œWe will do what is necessary to confirm Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, yes,â€\\x9d he told Fox Newsâ€™ Shannon Bream on â€œAmericaâ€™s Newsroom,â€\\x9d when asked if theyâ€™d go that route.
 Thune, who serves in the No. 3 position in Senate GOP leadership as chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, added that Democrats â€œhave not laid a glove on himâ€\\x9d in the hearings and predicted the judge would get an â€œaffirmativeâ€\\x9d vote in the Senate.
 The threat comes as Democrats not only threaten to filibuster but suggest he shouldnâ€™t get a vote until the FBI completes its probe of possible links between Russia and Trump associates.
 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., both called Tuesday for a postponement on any vote to confirm Gorsuch to the nationâ€™s highest court.
 â€œIt is unseemly to be moving forward so fast on confirming a Supreme Court justice with a lifetime appointment while this big gray cloud of an FBI investigation hangs over the presidency,â€\\x9d Schumer said. â€œYou can bet if the shoe were on the other foot and a Democratic president was under investigation by the FBI the Republicans would be howling at the moon about filling a Supreme Court seat in such circumstances."
 Warren added on Twitter: â€œNeil Gorsuch is up for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court from a President whose campaign is under FBI investigation.â€\\x9d
 Republicans panned the call as "ridiculous." But Democrats could still try and filibuster, requiring Gorsuch to garner 60 â€œyeaâ€\\x9d votes in the Senate. That's a high bar for Republicans, who have just 52 members in the Senate.
 That's where the so-called "nuclear option" comes in. If majority Republicans change the threshold, Gorsuch could be approved with a simple majority of 51 votes.
 The nuclear option was first used by Democrats for circuit court judicial appointments in 2013 and top Republicans â€“ including President Trump â€“ have indicated for weeks itâ€™s a serious option in order to get Gorsuch on the court.
 â€œIf we end up with that gridlock, I would say, â€˜If you can, Mitch, go nuclear,'â€\\x9d Trump said Feb. 1.
 Republican Senate leaders so far have refrained from using the term â€“ but their exasperated rhetoric shows theyâ€™re at least kicking the tires of a legislative Enola Gay.
 â€œIf Judge Gorsuch canâ€™t achieve 60 votes in the Senate, could any judge appointed by a Republican president be approved with 60 or more votes in the Senate?â€\\x9d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., asked on Tuesday. â€œIf they donâ€™t find Gorsuch acceptable, are they taking the position the vacancy should never be filled? At all?â€\\x9d
 McConnell hasnâ€™t tipped his hand on strategy; however, heâ€™s maintained in interviews that, one way or another, â€œthe nominee will be confirmed.â€\\x9d
 Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., meanwhile, lamented the increasing politicization of Supreme Court nominations and implored his Democratic colleagues to vote on the man â€“ not the party of the president who nominated him.
 â€œHereâ€™s what I hope â€“ that we turn around and go back to where we were, because what weâ€™re doing is going to destroy the judiciary over time,â€\\x9d Graham said on Monday.
 Supreme Court justices have faced more pushback from the opposition party in recent years. Antonin Scalia â€“ whom Gorsuch would replace on the court following Scaliaâ€™s death in 2016 â€“ was confirmed 98-0 and Anthony Kennedy had a tally of 97-0 in 1988. But the contentious Clarence Thomas hearing in 1991 produced a 52-48 split that just pushed Thomas over the finish line. Ruth Bader Ginsburg was confirmed 96-3 two years later and â€œyeaâ€\\x9d votes have largely dwindled ever since: Stephen Breyer, 87; John Roberts, 78; Samuel Alito, 58; Sonia Sotomayor, 68; Elena Kagan, 63.

TITLE: Alabama Republicans Defend Roy Moore: â€˜It Was 40 Years Agoâ€™

PUBLISHED: 2017/11/10

Republican officials in Alabama staunchly defended their partyâ€™s Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, after a report that he had made sexual advances toward four teenage girls when he was in his 30s.
 The Washington Post reported that, in early 1979, Mr. Moore, then a district attorney and later the chief justice of the state Supreme Court, had approached a 14-year-old, eventually kissing her, undressing her, touching her over her bra and underpants, and guiding her hand to touch him over his underwear.
 The paper found three other women who said they had been pursued by Mr. Moore around the same time, when they were between 16 and 18 years old. The Post interviewed more than 30 people in reporting its account.
 Mr. Moore told The Post that the allegations were â€œcompletely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and the Washington Post on this campaign.â€\\x9d He is set to face Doug Jones, a Democrat, in a special election next month.
 The story was met with immediate backlash from Republicans in Alabama, several of whom dismissed the womenâ€™s stories out of hand. Some called the article a partisan plot, even as the reporters behind it described in detail how they had uncovered the story and corroborated the allegations. Here are some of the officialsâ€™ responses.
 â€˜Total contrived media garbageâ€™
 Thatâ€™s how John Skipper, 66, a former chairman of the Mobile County Republican Party, characterized the claims, speaking to The New York Times.
 He said that he and other Alabama Republicans would continue to support their candidate and echoed Mr. Mooreâ€™s assertion that the Democratic Party had been behind the story.
 â€œMost of them will not be shocked,â€\\x9d he said, â€œand will rather be expecting these shenanigans being pulled by the Democrats as standard operating procedure.â€\\x9d
 Alabamaâ€™s state auditor, Jim Ziegler, told The Washington Examiner that the womenâ€™s claims were â€œmuch ado about nothingâ€\\x9d and said that Mr. Moore had done nothing â€œimmoral or illegal.â€\\x9d (Alabama law, both in 1979 and now, finds that someone who is 19 or older and has sexual contact with someone between the ages of 12 and 16 is guilty of second-degree sex abuse.)
 Mr. Ziegler sought to justify Mr. Mooreâ€™s actions by comparing him to the biblical Joseph, saying, â€œMary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter. They became parents of Jesus.â€\\x9d
 â€œIf they believe this man is predatory, they are guilty of allowing him to exist for 40 years,â€\\x9d he said. â€œI think someone should prosecute and go after them. You canâ€™t be a victim 40 years later, in my opinion.â€\\x9d
 Daniel Dale, a reporter for The Toronto Star, contacted multiple Republican officials in the state and kept a running report of their responses to the story.
 Jerry Pow, the party chairman for Bibb County, told Mr. Dale that heâ€™d back Mr. Moore even if the candidate had committed a sex crime.
 â€œI would vote for Judge Moore because I wouldnâ€™t want to vote for Doug,â€\\x9d he said. â€œIâ€™m not saying I support what he did.â€\\x9d
 Others, including the party chairmen for Covington County, William Blocker, and Mobile County, John Skipper, dismissed the story as a Democratic trick. Mr. Blocker said that he would not change his mind even if there was proof that Mr. Moore was guilty.
 Riley Seibenhener, the party chairman in Geneva County, told Mr. Dale that if the allegations were true, he would not support the candidate. But he also said that Mr. Moore was not guilty of â€œforcible rape.â€\\x9d
 â€œI know that 14-year-olds dontâ€™t make good decisions,â€\\x9d he said.

TITLE: Donald Trump Is Sworn In as President, Capping His Swift Ascent

PUBLISHED: 2017/01/20

WASHINGTON â€” Donald John Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, ushering in a new era that he vowed would shatter the established order and reverse a national decline that he called â€œthis American carnage.â€\\x9d
 In a ceremony that capped a remarkable rise to power, Mr. Trump presented himself as the leader of a populist uprising to restore lost greatness. He outlined a dark vision of an America afflicted by â€œthe ravagesâ€\\x9d of economic dislocation and foreign exploitation, requiring his can-do approach to turn around.
 â€œI will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down,â€\\x9d Mr. Trump told hundreds of thousands of rain-soaked admirers and onlookers in a forceful 16-minute Inaugural Address from the West Front of the Capitol. â€œAmerica will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Trumpâ€™s ascension amounted to a hostile takeover of a capital facing its most significant disruption in generations. While officially a Republican, he has taken on leaders of both parties and, with no prior political career of his own, made clear that he saw himself as the ultimate outsider not beholden to the current system.
 â€œWe will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining but never doing anything about it,â€\\x9d he said. â€œThe time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action. Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Trumpâ€™s view of the United States was strikingly grim for an Inaugural Address â€” a country where mothers and children are â€œtrapped in poverty in our inner cities,â€\\x9d where â€œrusted-out factoriesâ€\\x9d are â€œscattered like tombstones across the landscapeâ€\\x9d and where drugs and crime â€œhave stolen too many lives.â€\\x9d
 â€œThis American carnage,â€\\x9d he declared, â€œstops right here and stops right now.â€\\x9d
 He got started right away with rolling back the policies of his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, by issuing orders freezing new regulations from recent weeks and ordering agencies to â€œease the burdenâ€\\x9d of the Affordable Care Act during the transition from repealing to replacing the law. More orders are planned for next week.
 Wearing a dark suit and red tie and accompanied by his wife, Melania, in a powder-blue suit and matching gloves, Mr. Trump took the 35-word oath administered by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. precisely at noon. Michael Richard Pence, a former governor and congressman from Indiana, was sworn in minutes before as vice president by Justice Clarence Thomas.
 Mr. Trump assumed the presidency of a country still unsettled after a polarizing election and entered office with less support in polls than any other president in recent history. It was clear from the day that there would be no grace period either for or by the new president. The Senate confirmed two cabinet nominations â€” James N. Mattis as defense secretary and John F. Kelly as secretary of homeland security â€” but Democrats temporarily held up Mike Pompeoâ€™s confirmation as C.I.A. director.
 Throughout the day, there were mostly peaceful protests against the new president. Sporadic violence broke out as demonstrators smashed shop windows and burned a limousine, while police officers in riot helmets responded with tear gas. More than 200 people were arrested. Liberal groups prepared for a womenâ€™s march on Saturday that they said could draw hundreds of thousands.
 Mr. Trump made only passing efforts to reach out to Democrats beyond thanking Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, for their handling of the transition. â€œThey have been magnificent,â€\\x9d he said in his speech.
 He later praised his defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton, at a lobster-and-beef luncheon with congressional leaders, asking her and former President Bill Clinton to stand for applause. â€œI have a lot of respect for these two people,â€\\x9d he said.
 Democrats were not impressed. â€œI was pretty shocked by how dark it was,â€\\x9d Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said of Mr. Trumpâ€™s Inaugural Address. â€œI love this country, and I donâ€™t understand how a president of the United States that loves his country could paint a picture of its failures.â€\\x9d
 He added, â€œIt was interesting sitting up onstage with a bunch of billionaires hearing him say how bad the country was.â€\\x9d
 The National Mall was filled with supporters, many wearing â€œMake America Great Againâ€\\x9d hats and chanting â€œTrump! Trump! Trump!â€\\x9d But the lingering animosity from the presidential campaign was on display, too. When Mrs. Clinton arrived, some in the crowd chanted, â€œLock her up,â€\\x9d mimicking Mr. Trumpâ€™s campaign rallies. As he took the oath, a cluster of people blew whistles and screamed, â€œNot my president,â€\\x9d before being escorted out.
 While large, the crowds on a soggy day did not rival the energetic throngs at Mr. Obamaâ€™s first inauguration eight years ago, according to aerial photographs. The Washington Metrorail system recorded fewer than half as many rides on Friday morning as in 2009, and knots of bystanders along the inaugural parade route were not as thick. In a city that gave just 4 percent of its vote to Mr. Trump, many residents left town and about 60 House Democrats boycotted the event.
 Mr. Obama made his exit after the ceremony, flying by helicopter to Joint Base Andrews in the Maryland suburbs, where he thanked former aides and members of his administration before boarding the presidential jet, no longer designated Air Force One, to fly to Palm Springs, Calif., for vacation. He will return to Washington to a rental house while his daughter Sasha finishes high school, the first president to stay in the capital since Woodrow Wilson.
 Hours before his departure, Mr. Obama posted on Twitter to thank followers and hint that he would not fade away. â€œI wonâ€™t stop,â€\\x9d he said. â€œIâ€™ll be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by your voices of truth and justice, good humor, and love.â€\\x9d
 Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his wife, Jill, rode an Amtrak train to Delaware and the home they have there. But they, too, planned to return, at least part time, to Washington, where Mrs. Biden teaches at a community college in the Virginia suburbs.
 The United States has never seen a president quite like Mr. Trump, the son and grandson of immigrants who grew up to become a real estate magnate, casino owner, beauty pageant operator and reality television star whose tumultuous love life played out in the tabloids.
 Never has the oath been administered to a president who had never served either in public office or as a general in the military. At age 70, Mr. Trump became the oldest president sworn in for the first time and the first born in New York since Franklin D. Roosevelt.
 He was also one of the wealthiest presidents ever to enter the White House, with far-reaching business connections that have already raised questions about where his interests end and the countryâ€™s begin. He arrived in the Oval Office dogged by reports about Russian interference in the election on his behalf.
 But Mr. Trump overcame skeptics when he embarked on what seemed like a quixotic bid for the presidency. An Ivy League-educated mogul who lives in a New York tower named after himself with an 80-foot-long living room, he transformed himself into the unlikely leader of a working-class movement anchored in rural areas far removed from the coasts.
 His bracing candor, disregard for convention and willingness to offend whole sections of the population to make a point came across as refreshing truth-telling to many Americans disenchanted with Washington elites.
 For the nationâ€™s 58th inauguration, though, the untraditional president opted to follow tradition. He and Mrs. Trump, a former model from Slovenia who became the first foreign-born first lady since John Quincy Adamsâ€™s wife, Louisa, started the day with a service at St. Johnâ€™s Episcopal Church adjacent to Lafayette Square, then joined the Obamas, Bidens and Pences for coffee at the White House.
 From there, the two presidents shared a limousine to the Capitol, where three other presidents waited: Mr. Clinton, Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush, all of whom opposed Mr. Trumpâ€™s election. Former President George Bush remained hospitalized in Houston, recovering from pneumonia, but a spokesman said he watched the ceremony on television.
 Mr. Pence, 57, was sworn in at 11:54 a.m., placing his hand on Ronald Reaganâ€™s Bible, which was held by his wife, Karen, as their three adult children, Michael, Charlotte and Audrey, watched.
 For his oath, Mr. Trump placed his hand on two Bibles held by his wife, one given him by his mother in 1955 just before his ninth birthday and another used by Abraham Lincoln in 1861 and again by Mr. Obama in 2009 and 2013.
 Standing nearby were his adult children from two previous marriages, Donald Jr., Eric, Ivanka and Tiffany. Also there was Barron, his 10-year-old son with the first lady. Joining them was Ivankaâ€™s husband, Jared Kushner, who will serve as an unpaid senior adviser.
 As Mr. Trump approached the podium, rain began to fall. It was not a conventionally Republican speech, with nothing about tax cuts or restraining government. Instead, he laid out a protectionist agenda, saying his rule will be â€œbuy American and hire American.â€\\x9d He did pledge to â€œeradicate from the face of the Earthâ€\\x9d Islamic terrorism. Responding to charges that he demonized Mexicans and Muslims, Mr. Trump said, â€œThere is no room for prejudice.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Trump said the inauguration was not merely the transfer of power from one president to another. â€œWe are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people,â€\\x9d he said.
 â€œFor too long,â€\\x9d he continued, â€œa small group in our nationâ€™s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished but the people did not share in the wealth.â€\\x9d He added, â€œThat all changes starting right here and right now.â€\\x9d

Kathy Griffin Apologizes For Controversial Images Of Bloodied Trump Head
 This feels like an â€œAmericaâ€™s Next Top Modelâ€\\x9d challenge gone so horribly wrong.
 Kathy Griffin has made a career out of shocking her public by telling stories of Lindsay Lohanâ€™s fire crotch and simulating oral sex with Anderson Cooper on CNN, but she took things to a whole new level with a controversial photo shoot.
 Shot by celebrity photographer and director Tyler Shields, the comedian stares the camera down in one photo, as she holds what resembles the bloody head of President Donald Trump.
 â€œKathy is all about pushing the limits and she went above and beyond on this one. Now lets just hope she stays out of jail,â€\\x9d a representative for Shields told HuffPost.
 In other (and considerably less gory) photos shot by Shields, Griffin poses by the pool in a revealing leather getup as a man holding a camera stands above her.
 According to New York Magazine writer Yashar Ali, Griffin claims that the image is an â€œexpression of artâ€\\x9d inspired by Trumpâ€™s comments about former Fox News correspondent Megyn Kelly having â€œblood coming out of her eyesâ€\\x9d and â€œout of her â€” wherever.â€\\x9d
 After news of the photo shoot broke, Griffin took to Twitter to explain her motivations behind the image and reiterate that she does not condone violence in any way. She does, however, condone â€œmocking the Mocker in Chief.â€\\x9d
 UPDATE - May 30, 10 p.m.: Kathy Griffin issued a formal apology for the controversial images on Twitter.
 â€œI went way too far,â€\\x9d she said in a video on the social media site.
 UPDATE - May 30, 5:20 p.m.: Hours after Kathy Griffinâ€™s photo shoot with a fake bloody Donald Trump head made the internet rounds, the official Twitter account for the U.S. Secret Service has issued a statement.
 A Secret Service representative confirmed to HuffPost that the following tweets were in direct response to the controversial image.
 â€œOn it! @SecretService has a robust protective intelligence division that monitors open source reporting & social media to evaluate threats,â€\\x9d the tweets read. â€œThreats made against @SecretService protectees receive the highest priority of all of our investigations,â€\\x9d with the hashtag #ProtectionNeverRests.

TITLE: Joe Lieberman emerges as Trump's top choice for FBI director

PUBLISHED: 2017/05/18

President Trump said Thursday he is â€œvery closeâ€\\x9d to naming a new FBI director to replace James Comey, and his leading contender is former Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman.
 Lieberman, 75, who served in the Senate from 1989-2013, first as a Democrat and then as an independent, met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday afternoon to discuss leading the law enforcement agency. A late and somewhat unlikely addition to Trump's short list, Lieberman is nonetheless the sudden frontrunner.
 When asked point-blank by a reporter in the Oval Office Thursday if Lieberman was the leading contender, Trump replied, "Yes."
 Trump also met Wednesday with current acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating and FBI official Richard McFeely.
 Liebermanâ€™s law enforcement experience stems from his two-term tenure as Connecticutâ€™s attorney general, spanning from 1983 until his resignation in 1989 when he was elected to the U.S. Senate.
 Lieberman, who ran as vice president on Al Gore's 2000 ticket, became an independent after losing the Democratic primary in 2006. He won re-election, and two years later further angered Democrats when he endorsed John McCain for president against eventual winner Barack Obama, even speaking at the Republican National Convention.
 Lieberman told Fox Business Network last year that he â€œnever changed partiesâ€\\x9d and in fact ended up endorsing Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential campaign against Trump.
 Some Republican senators called the idea of Lieberman replacing Comey â€œintriguing,â€\\x9d but Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said it was a â€œmistakeâ€\\x9d to nominate him.
 "Lieberman is probably the only person who can get 100 votes in the Senate," Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, said on Capitol Hill on Thursday after the closed Senate briefing with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Cornyn was on the White House's shortlist to replace Comey, but withdrew himself from consideration this week.
 On Thursday morning on the Senate floor, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., argued against a â€œcareer politicianâ€\\x9d of either party to lead the FBI, though he did not name Lieberman.

TITLE: Shooting spurs calls for new lawmaker security measures

PUBLISHED: 2017/06/15

Lawmakers at the scene of Wednesdayâ€™s baseball practice shooting described themselves as â€œsitting ducksâ€\\x9d and said the violence would have been a â€œmassacreâ€\\x9d if not for Majority Whip Steve Scalise's detail -- spurring new questions over whether congressional security practices should be overhauled.
 Thursday night, the MedStar Washington Hospital Center issued a statement saying Scalise "underwent a second surgery related to his internal injuries and a broken bone in his leg. He remains in critical condition, but has improved in the last 24 hours. The Congressman will require additional operations, and will be in the hospital for some time."
 Scalise, R-La., like other members of leadership, is assigned a full-time security detail from U.S. Capitol Police, who guard him in Washington and at home in his district. His detail was credited with putting down the attacker and saving lives.
 â€œIf Scalise was not there, heâ€™s the one with security detail, we wouldnâ€™t have had any protection and God knows how bad that might have been,â€\\x9d Rep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, told "Fox & Friends."
 Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., acknowledged the incident has sparked new security questions for members without assigned police protection at events outside Capitol Hill.
 He, along with several other members of Congress, suggested the most critical change may be to boost security for large lawmaker gatherings, even informal ones like the baseball practice in Alexandria, Va.
 â€œWe already had concerns and we have great law enforcement at home, first responders do a great job, but this makes you anticipate every event now in a new way,â€\\x9d Brat said on Fox Newsâ€™ â€œAmericaâ€™s News HQâ€\\x9d on Wednesday. â€œForty guys get together at the same time, that would be a major security event normally, but I think we got a little excited and didnâ€™t think things through as well as we could have.â€\\x9d
 Brat said lawmakers â€œmay need to recalibrate public events,â€\\x9d while also suggesting â€œtighter securityâ€\\x9d at town halls -- which most congressional lawmakers have scheduled through the summer recess. This year's town halls to date have been particularly rowdy and tense, prompting lawmaker concerns long before Wednesday's attack.
 The Wednesday attack injured Scalise; Matt Mika, a lobbyist for Tyson Foods; Zack Barth, a staffer from Texas Rep. Roger Williamsâ€™ office; and two U.S. Capitol Police officers, Special Agents Crystal Griner and David Bailey.
 â€œWithout Capitol Hill police, it would have been a massacreâ€”we had no defenseâ€”we had no defense at all,â€\\x9d Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said on "Fox & Friends." â€œWe were like sitting ducks.â€\\x9d
 Lawmakers have appealed for more security before, including after the 2011 shooting of then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. A detail for every lawmaker is likely not possible -- and security already is provided for major events and lawmakers facing a specific threat.
 But there are broad questions at hand in boosting security beyond that: particularly, does it hurt democracy to put an added barrier between lawmakers and constituents?
 â€œI bet most members of Congress would say they donâ€™t want [a] security detailâ€”I sure donâ€™t,â€\\x9d Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Pa., manager of the Democratic congressional baseball team, told reporters.
 Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich lauded the current system where lawmakers interact with the people on a regular basis in settings like grocery stores. He said the threat of the "occasional deranged person" should not change that.
 â€œWe start surrounding these folks with layers of guardsâ€”it will really cripple the ability to be a free society,â€\\x9d he said on â€œOutnumbered.â€\\x9d
 Gingrich added: â€œWe are a free country, and weâ€™re gonna run the risk of freedom.â€\\x9d
 Rep. Williams backed Gingrich's comments in a press conference on Capitol Hill Wednesday. Rogers was injured during the attack when he dove into the dugout â€œlike a pool without water.â€\\x9d
 But Williams suggested he would feel â€œsaferâ€\\x9d if he were allowed to carry a gun on Capitol Hill, reminding reporters that heâ€™s â€œa big Second Amendment guyâ€\\x9d -- and said â€œwe probably ought to take a look at our security in big groups like that.â€\\x9d
 Doyle, too, suggested that could be the solution: â€œI think when youâ€™re in an area with 30 or 40 members, where anyone can walk through, we need to re-think thatâ€”but I think most members would tell you they feel fine and theyâ€™re not looking for any security.â€\\x9d
 Rep. Thomas Massie, R-K.Y., took calls for additional security a step further on Thursday by re-introducing legislation that would allow those who have concealed carry permits in their home states to carry in Washington D.C.
 U.S. Capitol Police have not announced any increased security measures for congressional lawmakers, but said they will â€œcontinue to provide a robust and visible presenceâ€\\x9d around the Capitol.
 James Norton, who was deputy assistant secretary at Department of Homeland Security under the George W. Bush administration, told Fox News that staffing each member of Congress with a personal security detail would cost billions and acknowledged the unwillingness of some members to have additional layers of security. But he said they need to consider â€œthe dangersâ€\\x9d that come with public forums.
 â€œYou have to consider that there is a lot of information for the publicâ€”obviously members want to give as much information as they canâ€”a lot of calendars are broadcast, social media, information is readily available,â€\\x9d Norton said. â€œBut there are a lot of bad actors out there looking to do harm, and vigilance needs to be taken by each member and their staff.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Trump: Roy Moore will 'step aside' if sexual misconduct allegations are true

PUBLISHED: 2017/11/09

President Trump thinks Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore â€œwill do the right thing and step asideâ€\\x9d if the sexual misconduct allegations against him are true, the White House said in a statement Thursday.
 Speaking to reporters following the presidentâ€™s Asia trip on Air Force One, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also cautioned against a rush to judgment.
 â€œLike most Americans, the president believes we cannot allow a mere allegation, in this case one from many years ago, to destroy a personâ€™s life," Sanders said. "However, the president also believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside."
 Moore lashed out earlier at what he called "the Obama-Clinton machine's liberal media lapdogs" after The Washington Post reported on a woman's claims that the former judge and staunch social conservative initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was 14.
 In a series of tweets Thursday evening, Moore claimed "The forces of evil will lie, cheat, steal â€“â€“ even inflict physical harm â€“â€“ if they believe it will silence and shut up Christian conservatives."
 Amid calls for him to drop out of the race, Moore added, "Our nation is at a crossroads right now â€” both spiritually and politically. Our children and grandchildrenâ€™s futures are on the line. So rest assured â€” I will NEVER GIVE UP the fight!"
 The Post story centered on allegations made by Leigh Corfman, now 53. She told the newspaper that Moore, then an assistant district attorney, first approached her in 1979 outside a courtroom in Alabama where she was sitting with her mother. On another occasion, she said Moore, then 32, took her to his home in the woods and kissed her.
 During a subsequent visit, Corfman reportedly claimed he took off her shirt and pants; touched her over her bra and underwear; and guided her hand to his underwear. She said the two did not have sexual intercourse, and that she ended up getting dressed and asking Moore to take her home, according to the Post.
 â€œI wanted it over with â€“ I wanted out,â€\\x9d she told the Post, apparently recalling her train of thought at the time. Moore did take her home, she said.
 The report caused immediate problems for Moore with his own party as he heads into the Dec. 12 election against Democrat Doug Jones. Several GOP senators called on him to step aside if the allegations are true â€“ and at least one senator, Arizonaâ€™s John McCain, said he should drop out regardless.
 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who backed Mooreâ€™s rival Luther Strange in the GOP primary, said in a statement: "If these allegations are true, he must step aside."
 Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., head of the Senate GOP campaign arm, called the allegations â€œdeeply troublingâ€\\x9d and said: â€œIf these allegations are found to be true, Roy Moore must drop out of the Alabama special Senate election.â€\\x9d
 Jonesâ€™ campaign told multiple news outlets: â€œRoy Moore needs to answer these serious charges.â€\\x9d
 But Mooreâ€™s campaign issued a statement saying the report is â€œbaselessâ€\\x9d and false.
 â€œNational liberal organizations know their chosen candidate Doug Jones is in a death spiral, and this is their last ditch Hail Mary,â€\\x9d Moore campaign chairman Bill Armistead said. â€œJudge Roy Moore is winning with a double-digit lead. So it is no surprise, with just over four weeks remaining, in a race for the U.S. Senate with national implications, that the Democratic Party and the countryâ€™s most liberal newspaper would come up with a fabrication of this kind.
 â€œThis garbage is the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation,â€\\x9d he said.
 The Post noted that the legal age of consent in the state is 16, and sexual contact by anyone 19 or older with anyone between 12 and 16 years old is considered second-degree sexual abuse.
 The statute of limitations, though, has long since passed.
 The Post interviewed three other women who were teenagers at the time who claimed Moore pursued them when he was in his 30s, though he did not force them into any type of sexual relationship.
 â€œI have prayed over this,â€\\x9d Corfman told the Post as to why she came forward, â€œAll I know is that I canâ€™t sit back and let this continue, let him continue without the mask being removed.â€\\x9d
 Alabama's Republican governor, Kay Ivey, responded: â€œThese allegations are deeply disturbing. I will hold judgment until we know the facts. The people of Alabama deserve to know the truth and will make their own decisions.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Donald Trump Jr. Messaged With WikiLeaks During Presidential Campaign

Donald Trump Jr. Messaged With WikiLeaks During Presidential Campaign
 President Donald Trumpâ€™s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., communicated with WikiLeaks over Twitter direct message during the 2016 presidential race, according to a report in The Atlantic published Monday.
 According to messages obtained by The Atlanticâ€™s Julia Ioffe, Trump Jr. messaged with the WikiLeaks account between September 2016 and July 2017. The messages were given to congressional investigators probing whether Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign colluded with Russian officials to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. (Federal officials believe WikiLeaks published material, including emails from the Democratic National Committeeâ€™s servers, that had been obtained via Russian hackers.)
 Trump Jr. later on Monday confirmed his correspondence with WikiLeaks, posting several screenshots of the Twitter messages.
 The messages are mostly from WikiLeaks to the presidentâ€™s son, but Trump Jr. did occasionally respond to the messages. The organization made multiple requests of Trump Jr., asking him to provide his fatherâ€™s tax returns and suggesting the candidate refuse to concede if he lost the election to Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. (Trump Jr. didnâ€™t respond to either message.)
 On one occasion, Trump Jr. tweeted a link to a cache of leaked emails after the WikiLeaks account messaged it to him.
 On another, WikiLeaks wrote it was happy to see the elder Trump mentioning the group on the campaign trail. Moments later, Trump tweeted about the organization.
 After Trump won the election, Wikileaks suggested that Trump should prod Australia to appoint the siteâ€™s founder, Julian Assange, ambassador to the United States.
 The White House didnâ€™t immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment on the report. In a statement to The Atlantic, Trump Jr.â€™s attorney, Alan Futerfas, said, â€œWe can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum.â€\\x9d
 Vice President Mike Pence, who in an Oct. 14, 2016, interview with Fox News claimed the campaign had not been in contact with WikiLeaks, said in a statement late Monday that he had not known about Trump Jr.â€™s messages.
 â€œThe vice president was never aware of anyone associated with the campaign being in contact with WikiLeaks,â€\\x9d said Pence press secretary Alyssa Farah. â€œHe first learned of this news from a published report earlier tonight.â€\\x9d
 Weeks before the election, asked if the campaign was â€œin cahootsâ€\\x9d with WikiLeaks, Pence denied it. â€œNothing could be further from the truth,â€\\x9d he said. â€œI think all of us have, you know, have had concerns about WikiLeaks over the years, and itâ€™s just a reality of American life today, and of life in the wider world.â€\\x9d
 Trump Jr. became embroiled in the Russia investigation after it was revealed he and other campaign officials met with a Kremlin-backed attorney in June 2016 who had promised damaging information about Clinton. Leaked emails published by The New York Times show Trump Jr. arranged the meeting at Trump Tower in New York.
 â€œTo the extent they had information concerning the fitness, character or qualifications of a presidential candidate, I believed that I should at least hear them out,â€\\x9d Trump Jr. said in a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee, one of the congressional committees probing the campaignâ€™s Russia ties, in September.
 He said the meeting did not lead to anything, and has denied colluding with the Russian government.
 Trump Jr. is expected to publicly testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, according to the panelâ€™s top Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California.

TITLE: Donald Trump Defends Michael Flynn By Saying Hillary Clinton Is The Real Liar

PUBLISHED: 2017/12/04

WASHINGTON â€• President Donald Trump on Monday defended his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, by invoking his 2016 election opponent, Hillary Clinton.
 â€œI feel very badly for Gen. Flynn,â€\\x9d Trump told reporters before leaving for a trip to Utah, saying that Flynnâ€™s life has been â€œruined.â€\\x9d
 Trump then pivoted to Clinton, apparently referring to the FBIâ€™s investigation into her use of a private email server.
 â€œHillary Clinton lied many times to the FBI, and nothing happened to her. Flynn lied, and it destroyed his life, and I think itâ€™s a shame,â€\\x9d Trump said, before again claiming that Clinton â€œlied many times, [and] nothing happened to her. Flynn lied, and itâ€™s like, it ruined his life. Itâ€™s very unfair.â€\\x9d
 The president this morning says 'I feel badly for General Flynn.' #MorningJoe pic.twitter.com/tBp5aXWhBj â€” Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) December 4, 2017
 Flynn pleaded guilty on Friday for lying to the FBI in special counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s investigation into possible collusion between Trumpâ€™s campaign and Russia, becoming the first former administration official to face charges in the probe.
 Trump and the White House have long claimed that the investigations into the campaign have nothing to do with Trump himself. Flynnâ€™s indictment, however, makes it increasingly difficult for the president to distance himself.
 Flynn stepped down in February, saying that he had misled the transition team, including then Vice President-elect Mike Pence, about the extent of his contacts with Russian officials, which included discussing sanctions and the creation of a backchannel with the Kremlin.
 Trump and his lawyer, John Dowd, now claim that the president already knew about Flynn lying to the FBI, renewing questions of whether Trump obstructed justice in the investigation.
 In May, Trump told NBCâ€™s Lester Holt that he fired then-FBI Director James Comey with â€œthis Russia thingâ€\\x9d in mind. The following month, Comey testified before the Senate that Trump had requested that Comey put an end to the agencyâ€™s investigation into Flynn.
 In an interview with Axios published Monday, Dowd brought out a new defense: Trump isnâ€™t guilty of obstructing justice because he is the president.
 The â€œPresident cannot obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer under [the Constitutionâ€™s Article II] and has every right to express his view of any case,â€\\x9d Dowd said.

TITLE: White House Responds To Sexual Misconduct Allegations Against Roy Moore

PUBLISHED: 2017/11/10

WASHINGTON â€• The White House relayed President Donald Trumpâ€™s response late Thursday to bombshell allegations that Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore sexually molested a 14-year-old girl in 1979.
 White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, traveling with the president on his trip to Asia, told reporters that Trump â€œbelieves that we cannot allow a mere allegation â€• in this case, one from many years ago â€• to destroy a personâ€™s lifeâ€\\x9d but that if the allegations are true, â€œJudge Moore will do the right thing and step aside.â€\\x9d
 A spokesperson for Vice President Mike Pence said the veep â€œfound the allegations in the story disturbing and believes, if true, this would disqualify anyone from serving in office.â€\\x9d
 Mooreâ€™s campaign denied the allegations, which The Washington Post first reported, telling the paper the accusations of four women are â€œthe very definition of fake news.â€\\x9d The Post reporters talked to more than 30 sources in the course of their investigation.
 On Thursday, numerous Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill called on Moore to drop out of the race â€• if the allegations are true.
 During his 2016 campaign, Trump dismissed allegations of sexual misconduct against himself from more than a dozen women and threatened to sue some of his accusers. He claimed that a 2005 tape of him bragging about sexual assault, which was released last fall, was â€œlocker room talk.â€\\x9d
 In September, Moore, a controversial judge in Alabama, won the primary for the special election. He beat GOP establishment candidate Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.), who was chosen to fill the seat left vacant when Jeff Sessions became Trumpâ€™s attorney general.
 Trump notably backed Strange over Moore, though many members of his base, including former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, supported Moore.
 But after Moore won, Trump disavowed his endorsement of Strange, deleting tweets in support of him. And the day after the primary, the president tweeted in support of Moore, calling him â€œa really great guy.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Donald Trump Jr. releases messages with WikiLeaks from before election

PUBLISHED: 2017/11/13

President Trumpâ€™s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., corresponded with WikiLeaks before the 2016 presidential election, a dialogue of which the presidentâ€™s son confirmed Monday night on Twitter.
 In a series of tweets, Trump Jr. produced â€œthe entire chain of messages with @wikileaks (with my whopping 3 responses) which one of the congressional committees has chosen to selectively leak. How ironic!â€\\x9d
 The Atlantic first reported on Monday that Trump Jr. received a private message from the WikiLeaks Twitter account on September 20, 2016 â€” a message shown in the tweets produced by the presidentâ€™s son.
 â€œA PAC run anti-Trump site putintrump.org is about to launch,â€\\x9d WikiLeaks wrote. â€œThe PAC is a recycled pro-Iraq war PAC. We have guessed the password. It is â€˜putintrump.â€™ See â€˜Aboutâ€™ for who is behind it. Any comments?â€\\x9d
 Trump Jr. replied, â€œOff the record I donâ€™t know who that is, but Iâ€™ll ask around. Thanks.â€\\x9d
 In a separate October 2016 exchange, WikiLeaks urged Trump Jr. to â€œcomment on/push this storyâ€\\x9d about then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton wanting to â€œjust droneâ€\\x9d Julian Assange, the Wikileaks founder.
 â€œAlready did that earlier today,â€\\x9d Trump Jr. later replied. â€œItâ€™s amazing what she can get away with.â€\\x9d
 The messages obtained by The Atlantic were turned over to investigators by Trump Jr.â€™s attorneys. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence had access to the documents, a source told Fox News.
 â€œOver the last several months, we have worked cooperatively with each of the committees and have voluntarily turned over thousands of documents in response to their requests,â€\\x9d Alan Futerfas, an attorney for Trump Jr., said in a statement.
 â€œPutting aside the question as to why or by whom such documents, provided to Congress under promises of confidentiality, have been selectively leaked, we can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum.â€\\x9d
 According to the report, the messages are part of a long correspondence between WikiLeaks and Trump Jr., though Trump Jr. seemed to ignore many of the messages, including some which urged him to release â€œone or more of your fatherâ€™s tax returns.â€\\x9d
 President Trumpâ€™s attorney Ty Cobb told Fox News on Monday that he was not aware that Donald Trump Jr.â€™s attorneys provided these documents to congressional investigators, but said there is likely no legal issue, from what he knows of the documents.
 Wikileaks publisher Julian Assange tweeted about the report on Monday, saying that the organization couldnâ€™t â€œconfirmâ€\\x9d the messages with Trump Jr.
 Wikileaks â€œdoes not keep such records and the Atlanticâ€™s presentation is edited and clearly does not have the full context,â€\\x9d Assange wrote.
 â€œWikiLeaks loves its pending publications and ignores those who ask for details,â€\\x9d Assange continued. â€œTrump Jr. was rebuffed just like Cambridge Analytica. In both cases WikiLeaks had publicly teased the publications. Thousands of people asked about them. WikiLeaks can be very effective at convincing even high profile people that it is their interest to promote links to its publications.
 â€œWikiLeaks has such chutzpah that it allegedly tried to convince Trump Jr to leak his fatherâ€™s tax returns & his own â€œRussian lawyer meetingâ€\\x9d emails (he did),â€\\x9d Assange wrote. â€œWikiLeaks appears to beguile some people into transparency by convincing them that it is in their interest.â€\\x9d
 Assange also claimed that the â€œfull text of alleged DMs with context provides a different reading, unsurprisingly.â€\\x9d
 This is not the first time that Trump Jr. has been in the spotlight, and has had his actions brought into question amid the larger probe into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in the 2016 presidential election.
 In June 2016, Trump Jr. accepted a now-highly scrutinized meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, after he allegedly was promised â€œdirtâ€\\x9d on Hillary Clinton. The meeting was brokered by music publicist Rob Goldstone who promised the campaign information. Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, who was charged last month in Special Counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s probe into Russian collusion, also attended the meeting.
 Fox Newsâ€™ Matt Richardson and John Roberts contributed to this report.

TITLE: Trump Calls Elephant Trophy Hunting A 'Horror Show,' Says He's Unlikely To Allows Imports

PUBLISHED: 2017/11/17

WASHINGTON â€” Two days after suddenly halting his own administrationâ€™s decision to begin allowing hunters to import elephants killed in two African countries, President Donald Trump called such trophy hunting a â€œhorror showâ€\\x9d and said heâ€™s unlikely to change his mind and allow such imports.
 â€œBig-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal,â€\\x9d he posted to Twitter Sunday evening.
 In the face of widespread public backlash, Tump announced late Friday that he has suspended â€” at least for now â€” his administrationâ€™s decision to reverse an Obama-era ban on the importation of elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia.
 â€œPut big game trophy decision on hold until such time as I review all conservation facts,â€\\x9d he posted to Twitter. He adding that the issue has been â€œunder study for yearsâ€\\x9d but that he would provide an update after additional review.
 Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said in a statement on Twitter that he and Trump â€œbelieve that conservation & healthy herds are critical.â€\\x9d
 As HuffPost reported Wednesday, the administration optedto lift the 2014 ban after determining that sport hunting of elephants in those African countries would â€œenhance the survival of the species in the wild,â€\\x9d a spokesperson for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said. It also recently rolled back protections for African lions, releasing new guidelines that allow big game hunters to bring back to the U.S. animal trophies from hunts in parts of Africa.
 The decision regarding elephants was made public not by the federal agency but via a celebratory news release early Tuesday from Safari Club International, a trophy hunting advocacy group that, along with the National Rifle Association, sued to block the 2014 ban. Greg Sheehan, principal deputy director of the FWS, broke the news to the hunting organization during the African Wildlife Consultative Forum in Tanzania, an agency spokesperson told HuffPost. The forum, which ended Friday, was hosted by the Safari Club International Foundation and the United Republic of Tanzania.
 The Safari Clubâ€™s political action committees donated a collective $24,500 to Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign and Zinkeâ€™s 2014 and 2016 congressional campaigns, according to Federal Election Commission data. Zinke is a former Montana congressman and Navy SEAL.
 Conservation groups celebrated Trumpâ€™s sudden change in course Friday, which was believed to be a response to public pressure.
 â€œItâ€™s great that public outrage has forced Trump to reconsider this despicable decision, but it takes more than a tweet to stop trophy hunters from slaughtering elephants and lions,â€\\x9d Tanya Sanerib, senior attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. â€œWe need immediate federal action to reverse these policies and protect these amazing animals.â€\\x9d
 In a post to Twitter, Wayne Pacelle, the CEO of The Humane Society of the United States, said he was â€œgratefulâ€\\x9d that Trump would reconsider. â€œThis is the kind of trade we donâ€™t need.â€\\x9d
 The elephant trophy decision drew national headlines and a fierce response from celebrities and others across social media. Talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres launched a campaign called #BeKindToElephants. By lifting the ban, she said, Trump was â€œencouraging Americans to kill elephants.â€\\x9d
 A day after Trumpâ€™s suspension, the Safari Club sent out a â€œcall to arms,â€\\x9d encouraging hunters to contact Trump and Zinke and â€œtell them how much you appreciate the efforts of the Fish & Wildlife Service to remove barriers to sustainable use conservation for African wildlife.â€\\x9d And they blasted â€œhysterical anti-hunters and news media outlets.â€\\x9d
 â€œThe news from Africa could not have been better for hunters or for anyone who loves or defends hunting culture,â€\\x9d the group wrote.
 African elephants have been listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act since 1978. A provision of the law, however, allows for sport-hunted trophies to be imported if the government determines that hunting will help safeguard the population.
 The FWS concluded that Zimbabwe has made strides to improve elephant management and anti-poaching efforts, according to a notice published Friday in the Federal Register.
 Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was among the many people who called on Trump to abandon his trophy hunting decision. In a Friday statement, Royce pointed to the unrest in Zimbabwe â€” where a military coup is thought to be unfolding â€” and said he has no confidence that the regime is properly managing conservation programs.
 â€œElephants and other big game in Africa are blood currency for terrorist organizations, and they are being killed at an alarming rate,â€\\x9d Royce said. â€œStopping poaching isnâ€™t just about saving the worldâ€™s most majestic animals for the future â€• itâ€™s about our national security.â€\\x9d
 Hours before Trumpâ€™s review announcement, the FWS defended its decision as â€œpart of a robust United States conservation strategy that seeks to eliminate poaching and associated wildlife trafficking.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Democrats Concerned That The Supreme Court May Be Rigged For The Rich And Republicans

PUBLISHED: 2017/03/25

WASHINGTON â€• In recent years, the opposing party approached Supreme Court nomination hearings by honing in on the nomineeâ€™s character and temperament or on one particular case that could possibly derail the nominee. Nominees have, in turn, generally refused to answer any question directly, in an appparent fear of revealing any bias about a potential future case they may hear.
 The four days of Senate Judiciary Committee hearings held this past week for President Donald Trumpâ€™s nominee to fill the late Justice Antonin Scaliaâ€™s seat, Judge Neil Gorsuch, were different. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee took a different tack. They made an argument against the Supreme Court itself and its false presentation as a body above politics and power. That judges do not, as Chief Justice John Roberts once famously said, only call â€œballs and strikes.â€\\x9d
 At the base of this argument was a simple question that has been dogging Democrats ever since the infamous Bush v. Gore decision on the 2000 presidential election: Is the Supreme Court rigged to benefit corporations, the wealthy and, well, Republicans?
 Pressing this question did not knock Gorsuch off his steady stream of non-answers. The polished Gorsuch certainly did not make any deluded or deranged statements, as many have come to expect from the president, that could lead a Republican to flip on his nomination. The Democratsâ€™ argument was instead directed at both their base and their caucus to provide a clear rationale for opposing the nominee â€• no matter his qualifications.
 Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) made this point abundantly clear when he pointed to the series of 5-4 decisions made under Robertsâ€™ leadership that have changed laws to help Republicans get elected, big donors gain more influence in politics through campaign contributions and corporations gain more economic and political power.
 â€œI think these 5-4 decisions are a problem, you said sometimes â€• I think Iâ€™m quoting you correctly â€• sometimes big corporations can capture an agency,â€\\x9d Whitehouse said to Gorsuch. â€œThatâ€™s a well known principle of administrative law and of economics. Just letâ€™s be sure that our Supreme Court doesnâ€™t get to be one of those agencies thatâ€™s captured on any subject.â€\\x9d
 On this weekâ€™s episode of The Huffington Postâ€™s â€œSo That Happenedâ€\\x9d podcast, 2016 Democratic House candidate Zephyr Teachout, a constitutional law professor at Fordham University School of Law, said the Democrats took the right approach by aiming their fire at the court as an institution that shapes our economy and our politics.
 â€œI thought both Whitehouse and others rightly pointed out that after Robertsâ€™ confirmation we gotta pull away that fake story that youâ€™re just calling balls and strikes,â€\\x9d Teachout said. â€œWe know, and we know and have seen, that the Supreme Court reshapes power in our country.â€\\x9d
 Gorsuch, who worked on former President George W. Bushâ€™s 2004 reelection campaign and as a lawyer in his Justice Department, provided the expected performance past court nominees had given during his appearance; he stated that he would be shocked by politics coming into a courtroom. â€œIâ€™m distressed to hear you think that judges of the Supreme Court is an organ of a party,â€\\x9d Gorsuch told Whitehouse.
 It is no surprise that Democrats find little need to take this opinion seriously anymore. Former President Barack Obama had nominated Judge Merrick Garland to fill Scaliaâ€™s seat practically one year to the date before Gorsuchâ€™s confirmation hearing. Senate Republicans refused to hold public hearings for Garland and declined to meet with him in private. Gorsuchâ€™s nomination represents the fruit of the Republicansâ€™ decision to block Garland.
 Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt.) called this â€œan extraordinary blockade.â€\\x9d â€œIt was totally unprecedented in our countryâ€™s whole history,â€\\x9d he added. â€œSome likened it to the action of the tyrannical kings who claim that they have sole control, as one of our senators referred to here a few minutes ago.â€\\x9d
 Responding to Gorsuchâ€™s stated belief that justices have no partisan leanings, Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) explained, â€œAnd you know, you said earlier, there are no Democratic judges, there are no Republican judges. If thatâ€™s the case, what was Merrick Garland about? Thatâ€™s what it was about.â€\\x9d
 In addition, Democrats are still irritated at Roberts for promising to call only â€œballs and strikesâ€\\x9d in his 2005 confirmation hearing. Instead, he went on to anchor the five vote conservative majorityâ€™s decisions in controversial cases. These included Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which opened the door to unlimited corporate spending in politics; Shelby County v. Holder, which overturned a key section of the voting rights act; and numerous pro-corporate decisions limiting the rights of citizens to challenge corporations in courts, reducing the ability of states to protect patient and privacy and allowing mutual funds to lie to investors.
 Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) blasted Robertsâ€™ decision in Shelby County for creating a whole new constitutional doctrine out of whole cloth, â€œSo, so much for judicial modesty,â€\\x9d she said. â€œSo much for balls and strikes. So much for judges judge best when they judge least, which you mentioned tonight as a virtue.â€\\x9d
 The Roberts Court has done much to reshape power in the United States. The five vote conservative majority that included Scalia has sided with corporations and corporate lobby groups more than any other Supreme Court majority in recent history.
 After Gorsuch repeatedly stated that there was ample room for Congress to legislate without worrying about court decisions, Democrats reminded him of how the courtâ€™s decisions play a key role in shaping who is elected to Congress and, therefore, what bills can be passed in the first place.
 â€œ[B]y tilting the political playing field so heavily toward corporations and against individuals, hasnâ€™t the court impacted the composition of who is in Congress and made it therefore even harder for Congress to taking meaningful,â€\\x9d Hirono said. â€œMeaningful action to say past laws to protect worker safety or the access of students with special needs to an education?â€\\x9d
 Whitehouse asked about the courtâ€™s controversial Citizens United decision, â€œWhat could be more involved in politics than to open this ocean of dark money thatâ€™s flooded into our politics?â€\\x9d
 Democrats on the committee appeared frustrated that Gorsuch refused to acknowledge the courtâ€™s role in transforming both the political and economic worlds the countryâ€™s citizens operate in. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told Politico that Gorsuch â€œdid not win anybody over with his testimony.â€\\x9d Schumer added that he believed he had the 41 votes necessary to filibuster the nomination.

TITLE: Shooting Brings Rare Comity to the Capital, but Will It Last?

PUBLISHED: 2017/06/15

WASHINGTON â€” The lawmakers trotted from their dugouts at Nationals Park, together in a near-summer air that never quite felt swampy, united in a certainty that the game must go on, just not exactly as it had before.
 A day earlier, on another ball field some seven miles southwest, a gunman had opened fire on members of the Republican congressional baseball team, striking four people â€” including Steve Scalise, the majority whip of the House of Representatives â€” who were there for a practice.
 And on Thursday, the capitalâ€™s various institutional forces â€” senators and lobbyists, staff members with a job to do and residents with an evening to spare â€” joined, for a moment, in a bipartisan rebuttal: Play ball.
 Beneath a mostly cloudless sky, at least by the mid-innings, fans in the stands intermingled red and blue.
 Near the dugout, the presidentâ€™s daughter Ivanka Trump bantered with Chuck Schumer, the Senateâ€™s top Democrat, who chatted with two of her young children. Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, wore a shirt from Louisiana State University, Mr. Scaliseâ€™s alma mater.
 When a video message from President Trump played on the big screen, some of the Democrats in the crowd booed, but less lustily than usual.
 â€œYou are showing the world that we will not be intimidated,â€\\x9d Mr. Trump said. â€œThe game will go on.â€\\x9d
 Some members of Congress had not expected to stay behind for the annual showdown, with families and district business waiting for them.
 But by nightfall, the decision was clear.
 â€œWe come here, and these members become our family,â€\\x9d Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, said at the Capitol before a game he had not intended to see.
 He spoke of 1968 and of the political violence he had seen up close as a civil rights leader, invoking Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy.
 Mr. Lewis, now 77, stared straight ahead for a moment. â€œI have to stay,â€\\x9d he said softly.
 All day, before as more than 24,000 ticket holders filed in for the charity game, the shorthand for other tragedies ricocheted through the Capitol.
 At work on Thursday, those pangs visited lawmakers like a too-familiar houseguest â€” stalking them down the Capitolâ€™s corridors, past the Senate chamber where a ferocious health care debate had already resumed, along the hall where some had stood one day earlier as survivors, still in dusted cleats and uniforms, unharmed but unsettled.
 The reaction would be different this time, some said. More sustainable. It had to be. Probably. Maybe. Right?
 â€œWhatâ€™s the half-life?â€\\x9d asked Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi, appraising how long the comity might last. â€œI donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t know.â€\\x9d
 The skepticism is near-universal. Even one day out from the initial anguish, much of the political ecosystem seemed unchanged.
 In a Thursday morning tweet, Mr. Trump railed against the â€œWITCH HUNTâ€\\x9d of investigations of his associates. Elected officials accused one another of hypocrisy and selective memory on matters of policy, perhaps a bit more gently than they might have on a typical weekday.
 Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said he was warming up with Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, who is not known for bipartisan spirit.
 And Ms. Pelosi could not resist suggesting that Republicans were the initiators of the present rancor.
 â€œSomewhere in the â€™90s, Republicans decided on a politics of personal destruction as they went after the Clintons,â€\\x9d she told reporters earlier on Thursday.
 Moments later, she added, a bit regretfully: â€œI really am almost sad for myself that I have gone down this path with you, because I donâ€™t think itâ€™s appropriate for us to have the fullest discussion of it. Itâ€™ll be for another day.â€\\x9d
 But for an optimist in the city â€” and there still seem to be a few â€” there were flourishes to appreciate.
 House interns hauled signs: â€œScalise Strong,â€\\x9d â€œCapitol Police MVPâ€\\x9d and â€œUnvidvidedâ€\\x9d in red, white, and blue.
 Another attendee delivered this message, held aloft: â€œThis Democrat is here to support Congressman Scalise. Get well soon, sir.â€\\x9d
 Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic whip, resolved to wear a â€œTeam Scaliseâ€\\x9d shirt to the game. Ms. Pelosi sat for an interview alongside Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin. The Senate leaders â€” Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, and Mr. Schumer of New York â€” did the same.
 â€œWe donâ€™t dislike each other,â€\\x9d Mr. McConnell said, deploying a rare complimentary double negative.
 Among those on the field before the game was Representative Roger Williams, Republican of Texas, whose aide Zachary Barth was shot at the practice. Mr. Williams, a coach on the team, trudged out on crutches after injuring his foot in the Wednesday morning fray as well.
 David Bailey, a Capitol Police officer who was wounded while helping to stop the attack, threw out the ceremonial first pitch. (The ball was delivered to the mound, in an apparent bit of sponsorship oddity, by a Budweiser Clydesdale.)
 Mr. Scalise remained in the hospital on Thursday after a second surgery for internal injuries and a broken leg. Doctors said his condition was critical but improving. He received a standing ovation when he was introduced as a team member, with Democrats waving their caps at his image on the screen beyond the outfield fence.
 â€œMaybe with a little more time, the teams would be mixed,â€\\x9d suggested Representative Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida. â€œBut at least for now, the healthy competition will bring us together.â€\\x9d
 Several elements of the evening did diverge sharply from the ballparkâ€™s standard, professional fare â€” commonplace for a congressional game that has, since 1909, produced a steady torrent of middling baseball, worse trash talk and more than occasional injury.
 By the concessions, attendees discussed field director salaries and legislative wrangling. Khakis filled the grounds. A cutout of the head of Representative Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio, was held high.
 Chants of â€œWe love you, Pelosi!â€\\x9d rang out briefly, until the minority leader acknowledged them.
 Supporters from both parties raised hot dogs and beers, catching up on acquaintances in common.
 â€œWeâ€™re just one day removed, so it still feels different, I think,â€\\x9d Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said before the game, recalling past tragedies that many swore would reshape the nationâ€™s politics. â€œI hope it lasts.â€\\x9d
 At the practice on Wednesday, Mr. Flake had raced to Mr. Scaliseâ€™s side to provide water and first aid after the shooting stopped.
 He set out a goal for himself and his colleagues, uttered before inside the Capitol. â€œTone down our own rhetoric and not ascribe the worst motives to our colleagues,â€\\x9d he said hopefully. â€œThat can be done.â€\\x9d
 For an evening, at least, Washington delivered.
 A little before 10 p.m., the Democrats secured their final out for an 11-2 victory, taking a 40-to-39 edge in the lifetime series. As the players shook hands, the team managers â€” Representative Mike Doyle, Democrat of Pennsylvania, and Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas â€” gathered for closing ceremonies.
 Mr. Doyle did not hold the trophy for long.
 It was going to Mr. Scaliseâ€™s office, they decided, until he gets back.

TITLE: Donald Trump Sworn In As 45th President

PUBLISHED: 2017/01/20

WASHINGTON â€“ Five hundred and eighty-four days after descending his Trump Tower escalator to announce his candidacy, Donald J. Trump took the oath of office Friday to become the 45th president of the United States.
 Chief Justice John Roberts administered the 38-word oath at 12:00 p.m., capping Trumpâ€™s unlikely journey from New York City real estate developer and reality TV star to the nationâ€™s highest office.
 Trump won the Republican nomination against a crowded field of 16 other candidates, many far more experienced in politics. But he was able to capitalize on a primary voting base that was angry at the establishment GOP for not more aggressively fighting President Barack Obamaâ€™s policies.
 He trailed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election nearly the entire way. In the final month of the race, he was helped by the near daily release of internal Democratic Party emails stolen by Russian hackers as well as by FBI Director James Comeyâ€™s decision to reopen, briefly, the probe into Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server.
 Trump wound up winning Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania by a total of 78,000 votes. Clinton had counted on winning all three.

TITLE: Donald Trump Jr. Communicated With WikiLeaks During Campaign

PUBLISHED: 2017/11/13

Donald Trump Jr. Communicated With WikiLeaks During Campaign
 WASHINGTON â€” Donald Trump Jr. had multiple online conversations during the 2016 presidential campaign with WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy group that last year released a hacked trove of Democratsâ€™ emails, according to four congressional officials.
 Mr. Trump, the presidentâ€™s son, in recent weeks handed over Twitter messages he exchanged with WikiLeaks to several congressional committees investigating Russiaâ€™s attempts to disrupt the election, according to the officials. In September, Mr. Trump acknowledged in a closed-door interview with the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had corresponded with the group during the campaign, the officials said.
 The correspondence, which began weeks before the Nov. 8, 2016, election and continued through much of this year, is the second time it has been publicly revealed that Mr. Trump communicated with people and organizations with ties to the Russian government who were trying to undermine the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.
 In July, The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump met with Russians in June 2016 who said they had damaging information on Mrs. Clinton, and that the information was part of the Russian governmentâ€™s support for Mr. Trump.
 Mr. Trump on Monday night releasedseveralscreen shots of his messages with WikiLeaks. His lawyer, Alan S. Futerfas, said the documents were â€œselectively leakedâ€\\x9d among the thousands that have been turned over to congressional investigators.
 â€œWe can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum,â€\\x9d Mr. Futerfas said in a statement.
 By publishing thousands of hacked emails, American intelligence agencies believe WikiLeaks was acting as a conduit for Russian operatives.
 The Twitter messages were first reported by The Atlantic, which published copies of the correspondence.
 â€œHiya, itâ€™d be great if you guys could comment on/push this story,â€\\x9d WikiLeaks said in a message to Mr. Trump on Oct. 3, 2016, that included a quote from Mrs. Clinton in which she said she wanted to â€œjust droneâ€\\x9d Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder.
 â€œAlready did that earlier today,â€\\x9d Mr. Trump said in response. â€œItâ€™s amazing what she can get away with.â€\\x9d
 In a message a week later, WikiLeaks asked Mr. Trump to have his father tweet a link to a site where users could search through hacked emails from Democrats.
 â€œThereâ€™s many great stories the press are missing and weâ€™re sure some of your follows will find it,â€\\x9d WikiLeaks said, adding that the group had just released more emails stolen from Mrs. Clintonâ€™s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta.
 Mr. Trump did not respond. Fifteen minutes later, however, his father tweeted: â€œVery little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks. So dishonest! Rigged system!â€\\x9d
 Mr. Assange said on Twitter that he could not confirm whether the group had corresponded with Mr. Trump.
 â€œWikiLeaks loves its pending publications and ignores those who ask for details,â€\\x9d Mr. Assange said, adding that thousands of people had asked the group about the emails it had published.
 Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the messages, if real, are â€œone more example of Russians, Russian agents â€” in this case WikiLeaks â€” reaching out to senior officials in the Trump Organization or Trump campaign.â€\\x9d
 The last message Mr. Trump received from WikiLeaks was in July, shortly after The Times reported that he had corresponded with the Russians promising â€œdirtâ€\\x9d on Mrs. Clinton.
 â€œHi Don. Sorry to hear about your problems,â€\\x9d WikiLeaks said. â€œWe have an idea that may help a little. We are VERY interested in confidentially obtaining and publishing a copy of the email(s) cited in the New York Times today.â€\\x9d
 Shortly thereafter, Mr. Trump released the emails himself.

TITLE: House Intelligence Committee Will Subpoena Flynn, Schiff Says

PUBLISHED: 2017/05/24

WASHINGTON â€” The House Intelligence Committee will issue subpoenas to Michael T. Flynn, President Trumpâ€™s first national security adviser, the committeeâ€™s senior Democrat said on Wednesday, escalating Mr. Flynnâ€™s troubles with Congress.
 The Democrat, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, said Mr. Flynn had declined the panelâ€™s request for documents and an interview as part of its investigation into Russian meddling in last yearâ€™s election.
 â€œThose subpoenas will be designed to maximize our chance of getting the information that we need,â€\\x9d Mr. Schiff told reporters during a breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor. â€œAnd I think we need to use whatever compulsory methods are necessary to get the information that he possesses.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Schiff said he hoped the committee would issue the subpoenas this week, before Congress leaves for a one-week recess. It was unclear whether the subpoenas would seek documents or Mr. Flynnâ€™s testimony, or both.
 The subpoenas could not be issued without at least some support from Republicans, who make up the majority of the committee. A spokeswoman for Representative K. Michael Conaway of Texas, the Republican leading the investigation, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Conaway has repeatedly refused to comment on the details of the investigation while it is continuing.
 The announcement was made mere hours after the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee issued subpoenas Tuesday afternoon to Mr. Flynnâ€™s two firms, seeking information that could shed light on his lobbying work on behalf of Turkish interests last year, among other connections.
 On Monday, Mr. Flynn, in a letter from his legal team, rejected a subpoena for documents from the Senate committee, citing the Fifth Amendmentâ€™s protections against self-incrimination. He also declined the Senate committeeâ€™s invitation for an interview.
 Mr. Flynnâ€™s rejection of the subpoena put him at risk of being held in contempt of Congress, a rarely invoked process that, should lawmakers choose to pursue it, could result in a criminal citation.
 The Flynn Intel Group was paid more than $500,000 to represent Turkey in a dispute with the United States government while Mr. Flynn was advising the Trump campaign. He belatedly registered as a foreign agent for that work after being forced out of the Trump administration for misrepresenting his communications with the Russian ambassador to Vice President Mike Pence.
 Mr. Flynnâ€™s legal troubles have only mounted in recent days. On Monday, it was revealed that he had misled Pentagon investigators about his foreign contacts and sources of income while seeking a renewed security clearance in February 2016. Among the payments he did not disclose was a $45,000 fee from a Russian state-backed news organization for a speech he gave in Moscow two months before. During that trip, he was photographed at a gala sitting next to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.
 Lying to federal officials is a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison.
 As recently as Monday, in his letter to the Senate committee, Mr. Flynn has reiterated his offer to testify in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the committee, has dismissed that option.

TITLE: Trump Lashes Out at Kathy Griffin and Democrats

Trump Lashes Out at Kathy Griffin and Democrats
 WASHINGTON â€” President Trump assailed Democrats and a television comedian on Wednesday in his latest Twitter blasts since returning from an overseas trip in which he had largely abstained from the sort of combative social media postings that helped propel him to the Oval Office and have gotten him in trouble ever since.
 The president castigated Kathy Griffin, the celebrity comic and author, for posing for a video showing her holding what looks like the severed and bloodied head of Mr. Trump. The video touched off a storm of protests from people on all sides of the political spectrum, which forced Ms. Griffin to apologize, and CNN announced that it would fire her from the annual New Yearâ€™s Eve program she has co-hosted.
 In a statement later in the day, the first lady, Melania Trump, questioned Ms. Griffinâ€™s sanity. â€œAs a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing,â€\\x9d she said. â€œWhen you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it.â€\\x9d
 The Trumps had the support of the daughter of the woman the president beat in last yearâ€™s election, among others.
 Ms. Griffin went online on Tuesday night to express regret. â€œI sincerely apologize,â€\\x9d she said in a video. â€œIâ€™m just now seeing the reaction of these images. Iâ€™m a comic. I crossed the line. I move the line, I cross it. I went way too far. The image is too disturbing. I understand how it offends people. It wasnâ€™t funny. I get it.â€\\x9d
 She said she had asked the photographer to pull the images. â€œI beg for your forgiveness,â€\\x9d she continued. â€œI went too far. I made a mistake and I was wrong.â€\\x9d She did not address Mr. Trump specifically in her video.
 CNN, which has enlisted Ms. Griffin to host New Yearâ€™s Eve programming alongside Anderson Cooper for the last decade, announced on Wednesday that she would no longer appear.
 Mr. Cooper distanced himself, as well.
 Mr. Trump also lashed out at Democrats in Congress whom he accused of trying to squelch testimony involving the investigation into Russian meddling in last yearâ€™s election. Shortly after a â€œFox and Friendsâ€\\x9d segment reporting that Democrats no longer want to hear testimony from Carter Page, a onetime Trump campaign adviser, Mr. Trump wrote that it was all part of a â€œwitch huntâ€\\x9d against him.
 â€œSo now it is reported that the Democrats, who have excoriated Carter Page about Russia, donâ€™t want him to testify,â€\\x9d he wrote. â€œHe blows away their case against him & now wants to clear his name by showing â€˜the false or misleading testimony by James Comey, John Brennan â€¦â€™ Witch Hunt!â€\\x9d
 In a letter to the House Intelligence Committee reported by Fox and other news organizations, Mr. Page wrote: â€œI have learned from your Committee staff on this Memorial Day holiday that I might not be immediately afforded the opportunity to address the false or misleading testimony by James Comey, John Brennan, et al. as per our previously scheduled appointment for next week. In the interest of finally providing the American people with some accurate information at long last, I hope that we can proceed with this straight dialogue soon.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Page did not list what testimony he considered false by Mr. Comey, who was fired by Mr. Trump as director of the F.B.I., or Mr. Brennan, the former director of the C.I.A., who stepped down when President Barack Obama left office in January. But Mr. Page urged the committee â€œto investigate the growing evidence of collusion between Clinton campaign associates, Comey and other former Obama administration officials.â€\\x9d

TITLE: GOP Whip Steve Scalise, Others Shot At Early Morning Baseball Practice

PUBLISHED: 2017/06/14

WASHINGTON â€•House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) was still in critical condition on Thursday after a lone gunman opened fire Wednesday morning on a group of Republican lawmakers practicing for a congressional baseball game.
 Six people, including two congressmen, two police officers, a congressional aide and a lobbyist, were injured in the attack in an Alexandria, Virginia, park. The assailant, who authorities have identified as 66-year-old James T. Hodgkinson of Belleville, Illinois, was shot by police and later died of his injuries at a hospital.
 Scalise underwent surgery at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center after being shot in the hip. In a statement Wednesday night, the hospital said Scalise sustained â€œa single rifle shot to the left hipâ€\\x9d that â€œtravelled across his pelvis, fracturing bones, injuring internal organs and causing severe bleeding.â€\\x9d
 â€œHe underwent immediate surgery and an additional procedure to stop bleeding,â€\\x9d the hospital said, noting the congressman had received multiple blood transfusions and remained in critical condition late Wednesday. It said Scalise would need further operations.
 Before the surgery, Scalise was â€œin good spirits and spoke to his wife by phone,â€\\x9d his office said. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump on Wednesday night visited Scalise in the hospital, bringing flowers and offering support to the lawmakerâ€™s family.
 The Trumps also met with Crystal Griner, one of the two U.S. Capitol Police officers injured in the attack, and her wife. Griner and David Bailey, the other officer hurt, are in stable condition, according to Chief Matthew R. Verderosa.
 Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence also checked in on Scalise and Griner on Thursday.
 Zachary Barth, a staffer for Rep. Roger Williams (R-Texas), was shot in the leg. He was transported to a local hospital and has since been released. Williams sustained a minor leg injury.
 Matt Mika, director of government relations for Tyson Foodsâ€™ Washington, D.C., office, was also among those shot. His condition was upgraded from â€œcriticalâ€\\x9d to â€œseriousâ€\\x9d on Thursday, a spokeswoman for George Washington University Hospital confirmed to HuffPost.
 The attack took place shortly after 7 a.m. at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park, less than 8 miles south of the White House. U.S. Capitol Police officers assigned to Scalise engaged Hodgkinson in gunfire, and Alexandria Police responded soon after. â€œAt that point, we were able to calm the situation, and victims were transported to the hospital,â€\\x9d Verderosa said.
 The FBI is investigating Hodgkinson and his possible motives. Itâ€™s too early to determine whether the attack was politically motivated, authorities said.
 The shooterâ€™s weapons â€• a 9 mm handgun and 7.62-caliber rifle â€• were recovered at the scene by law enforcement officials. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ran traces on the weapons and found no evidence to suggest Hodgkinson purchased the firearms illegally, according to an FBI statement released Thursday.
 The FBI said it was processing a cell phone, a computer and a camera recovered from Hodgkinsonâ€™s van, which was in the parking lot of a YMCA adjacent to the park.
 Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) confirmed on Wednesday that Hodgkinson had volunteered for his presidential campaign. â€œLet me be as clear as I can be,â€\\x9d Sanders said in a statement. â€œViolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms.â€\\x9d
 Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who was also at the practice, told MSNBC that Scalise crawled through the dirt, bleeding, to get away from the shooter. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) told reporters that he used his belt as a tourniquet to stop a stafferâ€™s bleeding.
 Paul said that a number of aides were lying down during the attack as the shooter fired bullets their way.
 Paul told CNN that â€œnobody wouldâ€™ve survivedâ€\\x9d had Capitol Police not been there.
 â€œIt wouldâ€™ve been a massacre without them,â€\\x9d he said.
 Noah Nathan, 47, lives in a nearby apartment building and was at the dog park when the shooting took place. He said he heard at least 30 shots and got down on the ground, but couldnâ€™t see the shooter. â€œThereâ€™s no place I could go,â€\\x9d he said.
 The members were practicing for the Congressional Baseball Game, a D.C. tradition dating back to 1909. The event pits Republicans against Democrats and raises funds for area nonprofits, including the Washington Literacy Center, the Boys and Girls Club of Greater Washington and the Washington Nationals Dream Foundation. This yearâ€™s game is scheduled for Thursday night.
 Police shut down the streets for blocks around the field early Wednesday, and a helicopter was flying overhead.
 A lockdown has been lifted at the YMCA Alexandria, next to the field where the shooting took place, spokeswoman Dana Rucker told HuffPost. No members or staff were harmed in the shooting, but the building sustained bullet damage.
 â€œThey are shaken,â€\\x9d Rucker said of YMCA staff. â€œTheyâ€™re just grateful everyone was able to work together as a team and get out.â€\\x9d
 Hodgkinson was member of the YMCA, Rucker said in a statement. She said that while he appears to have visited the facility â€œfrequently and at all hours of the day,â€\\x9d staff received â€œno complaintsâ€\\x9d about his behavior.
 Lawmakers from both parties expressed sympathy for the victims. Trump said that he was â€œdeeply saddenedâ€\\x9d by the news.
 â€œOur thoughts and prayers are with the members of Congress, their staffs, Capitol Police, first responders, and all others affected,â€\\x9d he said in a statement.
 During a bipartisan briefing on Capitol Hill later Wednesday, lawmakers discussed the possibility of allowing members of Congress to use campaign funds to bolster security at their private residences.
 â€œThereâ€™s going to be a review of exactly what funds can and should be used in the event there are security concerns by any member,â€\\x9d said House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.). He added that Ryan was investigating the matter alongside the Federal Election Commission.
 â€œWeâ€™re looking at that,â€\\x9d Hoyer said.
 Many previously scheduled events around Capitol Hill were canceled Wednesday, including an event Trump was scheduled to attend at the Department of Labor. The FBI is taking over the investigation into the shooting, Alexandria Police Chief Michael Brown said.
 Jay Roberts, 60, lives nearby and said the game was â€œprobably one of the few moments with all this rancor and politics that they can have some normalcy.â€\\x9d
 â€œI imagined it would be something fun to watch, you know, because evidently itâ€™s partisan politics are put aside, letâ€™s have a softball game, letâ€™s have some fun,â€\\x9d he said.

TITLE: Top House Intel Dem: Flynn Not Cooperating With Russia Probe, Subpoenas Coming

PUBLISHED: 2017/05/24

WASHINGTON â€• The House intelligence committee is preparing to issue subpoenas against Michael Flynn after the former national security adviser denied a request to voluntarily turn over documents related to the committeeâ€™s Russia probe.
 Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the committee, said on Wednesday that the committee is prepared to use â€œwhatever compulsory process we needâ€\\x9d to obtain information from Flynn if he does not cooperate with the subpoenas. He added that the committee could issue additional subpoenas if other witnesses fail to cooperate, but did not name additional individuals.
 Citing the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Flynnâ€™s lawyer said on Monday that Flynn would not comply with subpoenas from the Senate intelligence committee, which is conducting its own parallel investigation into Russiaâ€™s interference in the election and whether it colluded with President Donald Trumpâ€™s associates. The Senate committee responded with two additional subpoenas on Tuesday targeting Flynnâ€™s businesses.
 The House committeeâ€™s subpoenas â€œwill be designed to maximize our chance of getting the information that we need,â€\\x9d Schiff told reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. â€œWe need to use whatever compulsory mechanism necessary to get the information he possesses â€¦ the Fifth Amendment right not to provide materials or documents is limited,â€\\x9d he added.
 Schiff said he is â€œskepticalâ€\\x9d that the committee would agree to grant Flynn immunity in the future in exchange for information.
 The committee is also looking for ways to obtain documentation of Trumpâ€™s conversations with top intelligence and law enforcement officials involved in a separate federal Russia probe.
 Trump implied earlier this month that he had â€œtapesâ€\\x9d of discussions with recently fired FBI Director James Comey that would be damaging to Comey. And the Washington Post reported earlier this week that Trump asked Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers to push back on the FBIâ€™s Russia investigation.
 â€œThat could be further evidence of an attempt to interfere with the investigation,â€\\x9d Schiff said of Trumpâ€™s reported request to Coats and Rogers. He also referred to past reports that the White House asked allies on Capitol Hill to refute negative press stories about Trump associatesâ€™ ties to Russia. â€œIf all of this is part of a pattern by the White House of interference or worse, thatâ€™s something that we have to find out about and itâ€™s something we have to stop,â€\\x9d he said.
 Despite concerns about Trump interfering with ongoing investigations into his campaign, Schiff warned that it is premature for Democrats on Capitol Hill to push for impeachment.
 â€œThereâ€™s a legal standard that needs to be met for impeachment and then thereâ€™s a very practical standard that has to be met,â€\\x9d Schiff said. Practically speaking, he continued, impeachment is only possible if Republican lawmakers and the general public believe Trump is unfit for office.
 â€œIf the Republicans in Congress or people at large in the country feel this is simply a way to nullify an election that others didnâ€™t agree with, then youâ€™re not going to meet the practical standards necessary,â€\\x9d Schiff said.

TITLE: Donald Trump Says Joe Lieberman Is His Top Choice For FBI Director

PUBLISHED: 2017/05/18

WASHINGTON â€• President Donald Trump is â€œvery closeâ€\\x9d to selecting an interim candidate to replace former FBI Director James Comey, he told White House reporters on Thursday.
 Trump confirmed that former Sen. Joe Lieberman is his top choice, according to White House pool reports. The founder of Liebermanâ€™s law firm â€• Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman â€• is one of the presidentâ€™s top lawyers.
 Trump met on Wednesday with Lieberman and three other candidates: current acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe; Frank Keating, the former governor of Oklahoma who previously served as an FBI agent and in high-level positions in the Justice Department; and Richard McFeely, who served in the FBI for 24 years before retiring as executive assistant director in 2014.
 Lieberman, who was the 2000 Democratic vice presidential nominee before losing a primary bid for re-election and becoming an independent, would be an unconventional choice. He has no federal law enforcement experience and, while currently at a high-profile law firm, is most associated as a centrist Democrat.
 He has previously said that he would support an independent commission to investigate ties between Trumpâ€™s administration and Russia. But it is his background in politics that had Democrats reacting with severe reservation.
 Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) called it a â€œmistakeâ€\\x9d to select an elected official to the post, saying that the FBI director should be a law enforcement official. While Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), in an interview with Huffpost, called the possible nomination â€œshocking.â€\\x9d
 â€œThere is no reason to appoint a politician to run the FBI,â€\\x9d Schatz said. â€œIt is contrary to everything the FBI is about and it undermines the confidence that the public needs to have in the independence of the agency. And more to the point, it is not as if there is no one else qualified to do this job. There are literally dozens of people who would get a unanimous vote.â€\\x9d
 It is rare for an FBI director to be appointed without the full backing of the Senate, Schatz noted. And he speculated that a Lieberman nomination would split the chamber.
 A top Senate Democratic aide, likewise, put the prospects of immense opposition to the pick bluntly in an email to HuffPost: â€œThere couldnâ€™t possibly be worse time to take the unprecedented step of handing the FBI over to a politician. That absolutely includes Senator Lieberman.â€\\x9d
 During a Thursday Democratic caucus lunch, Sens. Dick Durbin (Ill.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.) trashed the idea of Lieberman, or any politician, being in charge of the FBI, according to a senior Democratic aide who was in the private meeting. A majority of Democrats in the room said they agreed that heâ€™s a terrible choice. Not a one defended Lieberman.
 â€œThe FBI director should be drawn from the ranks of career law enforcementâ€Ž, prosecutors or the FBI itself â€• not politicians,â€\\x9d Durbin told HuffPost later.
 Republicans, by contrast, praised Lieberman. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) expressed â€œgreat admirationâ€\\x9d for the former senator, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) speculated that Lieberman could get 100 confirmation votes, and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), said he would be â€œoverjoyedâ€\\x9d if Lieberman, who is a friend of his, were picked.
 â€œJoe Lieberman has more experience than all of my Democrat colleagues combined, so screw them,â€\\x9d McCain said of Democratsâ€™ concerns.
 The need for a new FBI director came after Trump fired Comey last week, a stunning move that occurred amid the FBIâ€™s ongoing investigation into the Trump campaignâ€™s ties to Russia. A series of explosive reports over the last week have heightened the appearance that Trump interfered with the investigation. In particular, The New York Times reported that Trump asked Comey to shut down a separate probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynnâ€™s contacts with Russian officials, according to a memo Comey wrote to document a meeting with Trump.

TITLE: President Trump takes office vowing to restore prosperity, â€˜fightâ€™ for country

PUBLISHED: 2017/01/20

Donald Trump assumed the nationâ€™s highest office Friday as the 45th president of the United States, vowing in a tough inaugural address to restore prosperity and â€œfightâ€\\x9d for the country â€œwith every breath.â€\\x9d
 In a succinct speech heavy on populist themes, the new president told Americans across the country they will â€œnever be ignored againâ€\\x9d and promised concrete results.
 â€œThe time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action,â€\\x9d he said.
 The president addressed a packed crowd of spectators stretching from the Capitol across the National Mall on a mild but overcast and at-times drizzly day, after taking the oath of office along with Vice President Mike Pence.  The speech did not delve into policy details, and rather reprised objectives from his 2016 campaign on trade, immigration and national security.
 But the address was stitched together, more broadly, by an appeal for a â€œnew national prideâ€\\x9d and a rediscovery of American patriotism, as he described this as a salve for the countryâ€™s divisions.
 â€œWhen you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice,â€\\x9d he said.
 He also rebuked those who have held power in Washington, saying a small group reaped the rewards of government while â€œthe people did not shareâ€\\x9d in Washingtonâ€™s wealth.
 The address completes Trumpâ€™s remarkable journey from political outsider written off by countless Beltway pundits to the most powerful man in the country. His campaign manager Kellyanne Conway noted in an earlier interview with Fox News that Trump was â€œmaking historyâ€\\x9d as a businessman with no prior political or military experience â€“ someone successful in the private sector coming to Washington â€œowing nobody anything.â€\\x9d
 In blunt and unvarnished terms similar to the language used during his nomination acceptance address last summer, Trump on Friday lamented the jobs lost to foreign rivals â€“ he described â€œrusted out factories scattered like tombstonesâ€\\x9d across the land â€“ and the crime in Americaâ€™s cities.
 â€œThis American carnage stops right here and stops right now,â€\\x9d Trump said.
 Trump cast his presidency as a return to power for the people and vowed never to let them down.
 â€œFrom this day forward, itâ€™s going to be only America first,â€\\x9d Trump said.  â€œI will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down. â€¦  We will bring back our jobs, we will bring back our borders, we will bring back our wealth and we will bring back our dreams.â€\\x9d
 He also vowed to eradicate Islamic terrorism.
 Telling the American people this is â€œyour momentâ€\\x9d and â€œyour day,â€\\x9d Trump closed his speech with the promise that started it all: â€œWe will make America great again.â€\\x9d
 As Barack and Michelle Obama depart the White House after eight years in office, Trump will immediately be confronted with the challenge of governing, as he attempts to apply his CEO experience to running the nation.  His team has vowed a â€œrobustâ€\\x9d start to the Trump administration, which could include everything from rescinding controversial Obama actions to renegotiating trade deals to repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.
 An immediate task for the new administration will be to get Trumpâ€™s Cabinet nominees confirmed.  His advisers have complained that Democrats are slowing the process, and resisting the kind of swift confirmation the Senate gave many of Obamaâ€™s nominees in 2009.
 Before he spoke on Friday, throngs of protesters were causing disruptions on the edges of the security zone in Washington.  Some blocked checkpoints and forced their temporary closure earlier Friday morning, while elsewhere demonstrators resorted to violence and vandalism.  They clashed with police later in the afternoon, amid dozens of arrests.
 While dozens of House Democrats boycotted Fridayâ€™s ceremonies â€“ a move that fueled disputes with Trumpâ€™s team over the weekend â€“ other prominent Democrats and past presidents of both parties were in attendance for the transfer of power.  Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, whose loss to Trump marked one of the biggest upsets in modern political history, attended and tweeted shortly before Trump took the oath that she came to â€œhonor our democracy & its enduring values.â€\\x9d
 â€œI will never stop believing in our country & its future,â€\\x9d she wrote.
 Donald and Melania Trump met with the Obamas earlier Friday morning after attending a church service in Washington.  The new first family headed later to the parade along Pennsylvania Avenue, before an evening of inaugural balls and other festivities.

TITLE: Kathy Griffin apologizes for photo shoot with bloodied Trump mask, says she 'went too far'

PUBLISHED: 2017/05/30

Kathy Griffin admitted Tuesday she "went too far" on her latest photo shoot with controversial photographer Tyler Shields in which she is holding a bloodied mask of President Trump.
 The gory photo first published in TMZ from Griffin's photo session with the famed Shields, known for his shocking pictures.
 In a Twitter post late Tuesday, Griffin said the image "is too disturbing," and that "it wasn't funny."
 "I understand how it offends people," she said, adding "I've made a lot of mistakes in my career."
 According to the gossip site, Griffin joked with Shields on set they would need to move to Mexico after the photos were released or fear imprisonment. In her Twitter post on Tuesday, Griffin said she was going to "take down the image."
 "I went too far and I was wrong," she said.
 People took to Twitter to express their disdain for the photo shoot.
 Reps for Griffin did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment.
 Chelsea Clinton called it "vile and wrong" in a Twitter post.
 Shields told Fox News that Griffin was hoping to create a bold message.
 "Kathy and I are friends and we worked together before, so when we started doing this shoot, she said, 'I'd love to do something political. I'd love to make a statement,'" he explained. "We kind of figured out what would be the best image to make out of that."
 Shields added the image was meant to serve as art and he's aware that it could make some viewers uncomfortable.
 "That's what art is meant to do," he said. "Some people look at it and they love it. Some people look at it and they hate it... I understand there are going to be people that hate this. It's a very touchy subject... but this is not real. We didn't kill anybody nor do I feel anybody should be killed. It's no different from a movie. It just happens to be a still image."
 Shields tweeted a link to a YouTube video called "Behind the scenes with Kathy Griffin" but the video has since been removed. However, he later told Fox News that the video had glitches, which prompted him to take it down and then re-upload it.
 This is hardly the first time Shields' photos have caused uproar. He previously received death threats over a photo he took of "Glee" actress Heather Morris with bruises on her face. The photo was criticized for making light of domestic abuse.
 As for his recent collaboration with Griffin, he doesn't regret it.

TITLE: Democrats Plan to Filibuster to Thwart Gorsuch Nomination

PUBLISHED: 2017/03/23

WASHINGTON â€” Senate Democrats on Thursday vowed to filibuster the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, signaling an imminent partisan showdown over the nomineeâ€™s fate and the future of century-old rules in the chamber.
 As committee hearings on Judge Gorsuch concluded on Thursday, it appeared increasingly likely that Republicans hoping to elevate President Trumpâ€™s choice for the court would resort to replacing longstanding rules with a simple majority vote on his confirmation.
 While a parade of witnesses addressed the Senate Judiciary Committee, trading dueling views of Judge Gorsuch, the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, went to the Senate floor and announced that he would try to lead Democrats in blocking an up-or-down vote on Judge Gorsuch. The Senateâ€™s â€œclotureâ€\\x9d rule requires a supermajority of 60 votes to overcome such a filibuster.
 â€œAfter careful deliberation I have concluded that I cannot support Judge Neil Gorsuchâ€™s nomination to the Supreme Court,â€\\x9d Mr. Schumer said, citing concerns over Judge Gorsuchâ€™s record on workersâ€™ rights and his degree of independence, adding, â€œMy vote will be no, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.â€\\x9d
 Judge Gorsuch must earn the support of at least eight Democrats to break a filibuster â€” a threshold he is not on track to meet, at least so far, according to interviews and internal party discussions.
 If Democrats band together, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has threatened to pursue the so-called nuclear option eliminating the filibuster for Supreme Court selections. Mr. Trump has urged Mr. McConnell to take that step if necessary.
 Some Republicans have expressed reservations about changing the rules, but Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Thursday that he would relent if it meant seating Judge Gorsuch. â€œWhatever it takes to get him on the court, I will do,â€\\x9d Mr. Graham told â€œThe Mike Gallagher Showâ€\\x9d radio program.
 Mr. McConnell has said he wants the Senate to confirm Judge Gorsuch to fill the vacancy, which was created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia more than a year ago, before departing for a scheduled recess on April 7. Last year, Mr. McConnell led his party in refusing to consider President Obamaâ€™s choice for the seat, Judge Merrick B. Garland, during a presidential election campaign.
 On Thursday, Mr. McConnell accused Democrats of engaging in â€œobstructionist tacticsâ€\\x9d to block a well-qualified nominee.
 â€œDespite the judgeâ€™s outstanding performance, his exceptional background, and the extensive support heâ€™s received from people of all political leanings, we know that some Senate Democrats will continue trying to come up with any reason to delay the confirmation process,â€\\x9d Mr. McConnell said of Judge Gorsuch.
 During the four days of hearings, even Judge Gorsuchâ€™s critics did not dispute his credentials. On Thursday, representatives of the American Bar Association told the committee that it had unanimously found Judge Gorsuch to be â€œwell qualified,â€\\x9d the groupâ€™s highest rating. That was particularly notable in light of studies that have shown the group has tended to favor the nominees of Democratic presidents.
 â€œWe do not give the â€˜well qualifiedâ€™ rating lightly,â€\\x9d said Nancy Scott Degan, an official of the bar association.
 The group had also given its highest rating to Judge Garland. Since the evening Judge Gorsuch was nominated, liberal groups have been pressuring Democrats to filibuster the vote on him.
 Four years ago, when Democrats controlled the Senate and Republican senators were blockading Mr. Obamaâ€™s appeals court and executive branch nominees, Democrats changed the chamberâ€™s rules to bar filibusters for such positions â€” but left the filibuster rule in place for Supreme Court nominations.
 Republicans have cited this history often in accusing their colleagues of hypocrisy on Judge Gorsuch.
 To eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, Republicans would need to vote in virtual lock step: The party effectively has only 51 votes right now because one member, Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, is recuperating from back surgery, so just two Republican senators could block a rules change.
 Still, Judge Gorsuchâ€™s nomination is broadly popular among conservatives. The question facing Democrats is whether to have a filibuster fight over Judge Gorsuch, highlighting what they consider the theft of a seat they believe Mr. Obama had a right to fill, or whether to save that attention-grabbing tactic for a hypothetical future vacancy if a more liberal justice dies or steps down and President Trump nominates a staunch conservative who would shift the courtâ€™s balance.
 â€œI donâ€™t think we should move forward on the Gorsuch nomination until the nomination of Merrick Garland has been dealt with fairly,â€\\x9d Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, said on Thursday, signaling his support for a filibuster.
 Another moderate Democrat, Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, also said he would reject Judge Gorsuch and join the filibuster effort. Mr. Casey is among the 10 Democrats facing re-election next year in states that Mr. Trump won.
 Others in the group were less eager to declare their intentions.
 â€œIâ€™m going to keep on my theme Iâ€™ve been on for a couple of months,â€\\x9d said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri. â€œIâ€™m not going to talk about Gorsuch.â€\\x9d
 Even before Judge Gorsuchâ€™s nomination, Ms. McCaskill inadvertently drew the ire of liberal activists by expressing support for â€œa full confirmation hearing process and a vote,â€\\x9d before making clear she believed in a 60-vote threshold.
 Despite the escalating political friction, the atmosphere in the hearing room on Thursday was often more perfunctory than passionate, as panels of witnesses selected by Democrats and Republicans alternately expressed concerns that Judge Gorsuch was too conservative or praised him as a well-qualified and careful judge.
 Two of Judge Gorsuchâ€™s former colleagues on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver â€” Deanell Reece Tacha, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, and Robert Harlan Henry, appointed by President Bill Clinton â€” praised his intellect and temperament.
 But others expressed concerns. One strain of criticism came from human rights and civil liberties activists, who expressed alarm over Judge Gorsuchâ€™s experiences as a Justice Department official in the Bush administration in 2005 and 2006, when he helped to defend and advance the executive branchâ€™s positions on matters like detainee treatment and surveillance.
 Jameel Jaffer, who litigated national-security cases against the government as the former deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, urged the committee to scrutinize more closely Judge Gorsuchâ€™s views on executive power and individual rights.
 Mr. Jaffer pointed to documents showing, for example, that Judge Gorsuch had worked to get Congress to enact a law stripping courts of jurisdiction to hear lawsuits by GuantÃ¡namo Bay detainees, and in one email chain he criticized law firms that helped represent prisoners in seeking judicial review of their detention.
 On Wednesday, Judge Gorsuch told the committee that the email had not been â€œmy finest momentâ€\\x9d and that he had been â€œblowing off steam with a friend, privately.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Rep. Duncan Hunter, wife indicted on corruption charges in California

PUBLISHED: 2018/08/21

Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., and his wife, Margaret, were indicted on charges of illegally converting $250,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses and filing false records, prosecutors announced Tuesday.
 In response, House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday evening that he would remove the congressman from all committee assignments for the time being, calling the charges against Hunter â€œdeeply serious.â€\\x9d
 Among the allegations named in the 48-page indictment included instances between 2009 and 2016 when Hunter and his wife used campaign funds to pay for family vacations to Italy and Hawaii, school tuition, dental work, and even domestic and international travel for almost a dozen relatives, according to a press release from the Southern District of Californiaâ€™s U.S. Attorneyâ€™s Office.
 The indictment also alleged that the pair spent â€œtens of thousands of dollarsâ€\\x9d on items ranging from movie tickets, fast food, golf outings, groceries and home utilities.
 Fox News obtained a letter sent from Hunter's attorney, Gregory A. Vega, to U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein on Aug. 6 asking him to postpone the indictment.
 Vega contended that there was a "rush to indict" after a two-year grand jury investigation.
 Vega asserted the prosecution was "politically motivated" because of Hunter's early support of Donald Trump for president. He also claimed bias from prosecutors in the Southern District of California who supported Hillary Clinton's candidacy.
 The congressman's lawyers said in 2017 that Hunter and his wife repaid the campaign about $60,000.
 Prosecutors said Hunter and his wife â€œmischaracterizedâ€\\x9d the purchases in Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings to hide the illicit spending.
 â€œFamily dental bills paid with campaign funds were characterized as a charitable contribution to â€˜Smiles for Life,â€™â€\\x9d the press release from the U.S. Attorneyâ€™s Office said as an example.
 Charges included conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States, wire fraud and falsifying records.
 Hunter, one of Trumpâ€™s earliest supporters in the presidential race, allegedly was aware of what he and his wife were doing and continued to spend campaign funds on personal expenses despite multiple warnings from his campaign treasurer about â€œquestionable purchases.â€\\x9d
 â€œAccording to the indictment, the Hunters knew that many of their desired purchases could be made only by using campaign funds, since they did not otherwise have sufficient personal funds to pay for their purchases,â€\\x9d according to the U.S. Attorneyâ€™s Office.
 U.S. Attorney Adam Braverman said Tuesdayâ€™s indictment proved that â€œno one is above the law.â€\\x9d
 The pair is due to be arraigned in court on Thursday morning.

TITLE: Trump Accuses Former Clinton Aide of Failing to Follow Security Protocols

Trump Accuses Former Clinton Aide of Failing to Follow Security Protocols
 WASHINGTON â€” President Trump made his first â€œCrooked Hillaryâ€\\x9d Twitter post less than 48 hours into the new year on Tuesday, accusing a former Clinton aide of â€œdisregarding basic security protocols,â€\\x9d and calling his own Justice Department a â€œdeep state.â€\\x9d
 Attacking Hillary Clinton, his former Democratic opponent from the 2016 presidential election, and taking aim at his own Justice Department struck familiar tones for the new year. Almost 14 months after the election, Mr. Trump has kept up a regular drumbeat of attacks on Mrs. Clinton. Last year, Mr. Trump also criticized the Justice Department and Attorney General Jeff Sessions for not pursuing investigations of his political opponents.
 The Twitter post on Tuesday morning followed an article in The Daily Caller, a conservative publication that Mr. Trump closely monitors. The article said the aide, Huma Abedin, forwarded some government passwords to her private Yahoo email account in 2009, when Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state. Yahoo was hacked in 2013, which affected all three billion of its accounts. After the breach, the data was offered for sale by a hacking collective based in Eastern Europe. Mr. Trump also implored his administration to investigate Ms. Abedin.
 The term â€œdeep stateâ€\\x9d typically refers to a shadow government of agency officials who secretly plot to influence policy; they are usually associated with countries that have authoritarian elements that undercut democratically elected leaders.
 On Friday, the State Department released about 3,000 of Ms. Abedinâ€™s work-related emails. The emails were found on the laptop of Ms. Abedinâ€™s now estranged husband, Anthony D. Weiner, and were released as part of a public records request.
 The emails found on Mr. Weinerâ€™s computer are a sore spot for Mrs. Clinton. James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, had notified Congress shortly before the 2016 election about the existence of newly discovered emails that could be relevant to the closed investigation into Mrs. Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server while secretary of state.
 Mrs. Clinton, in a book released last year, said Mr. Comeyâ€™s disclosure hurt her campaignâ€™s momentum and helped Mr. Trump win the election.
 In his Twitter post, Mr. Trump also referred to the case of a Navy sailor who was jailed for taking pictures inside a military submarine. According to a report in Fox News, the sailor had hoped to receive a pardon from the president, but has not.

TITLE: Democrats Say Trump Should Cancel Putin Meeting After Indictments

Democrats Say Trump Should Cancel Putin Meeting After Indictments
 WASHINGTON â€” Leading Democrats called Friday for President Trump to cancel his upcoming meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia after the Justice Department indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers accused of hacking Democratsâ€™ emails and computer networks during the 2016 presidential race.
 Top Republicans were mostly mute, though a handful â€” including Representative Ed Royce of California, the retiring chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee; Senator John McCain of Arizona, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who has brain cancer; and Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a frequent critic of Mr. Trump â€” urged the president to use the indictments to get tough with Mr. Putin when they meet on Monday in Helsinki, Finland.
 â€œPresident Trump must be willing to confront Putin from a position of strength and demonstrate that there will be a serious price to pay for his ongoing aggression towards the United States and democracies around the world,â€\\x9d Mr. McCain said in a statement. â€œIf President Trump is not prepared to hold Putin accountable, the summit in Helsinki should not move forward.â€\\x9d
 A grand jury indicted the officers on Friday, accusing them of conspiring to interfere with the outcome of the 2016 presidential election by hacking the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clintonâ€™s presidential campaign and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The indictment is part of an open investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, who is examining whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, and whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice.
 â€œThese indictments are further proof of what everyone but the president seems to understand: President Putin is an adversary who interfered in our elections to help President Trump win,â€\\x9d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said, adding that Mr. Trump should cancel the meeting â€œuntil Russia takes demonstrable and transparent steps to prove that they wonâ€™t interfere in future elections.â€\\x9d
 A number of Democrats lined up behind Mr. Schumer. Some on the House Foreign Affairs Committee also called for Mr. Trump to cancel the Monday session, as did Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.
 Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, stopped short of calling on Mr. Trump to cancel, but he said the president should insist that other Americans be present and should demand that Mr. Putin extradite those indicted.
 â€œI would not trust the president alone with Putin without some other Americans in the administration in there,â€\\x9d he said. â€œFor the president to break with the normal practice and meet with the Russian president alone, I wouldnâ€™t trust what he says there.â€\\x9d
 The charges were announced here on Friday by Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who made clear during a news conference that the Justice Department views the hacking not as an attack on one party, but as an attack against the United States.
 â€œItâ€™s important for us to avoid thinking politically, as Republicans or Democrats, and instead to think patriotically as Americans,â€\\x9d Mr. Rosenstein said. â€œOur response must not depend on which side was victimized.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Sasse echoed that sentiment.
 â€œThe U.S. intelligence community knows that the Russian government attacked the U.S.,â€\\x9d Mr. Sasse said. â€œThis is not a Republican or a Democrat view â€” it is simply the reality. All patriotic Americans should understand that Putin is not Americaâ€™s friend, and he is not the presidentâ€™s buddy. We should stand united against Putinâ€™s past and planned future attacks against us.â€\\x9d
 But with the exception of Mr. McCain, Republicans steered clear of discussing whether Mr. Trump should cancel Mondayâ€™s meeting in Helsinki. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, did not have any immediate reaction, while a spokeswoman for Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said simply that Mr. Ryan was â€œglad these hackers are being held to account.â€\\x9d
 Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, a founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, asked if Mr. Trump should demand extradition of the hackers, said, â€œIâ€™ll leave that to the president.â€\\x9d Mr. Jordan said the president has already â€œbeen clear he is going to ask Mr. Putin some tough questions.â€\\x9d
 The chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, said he intends to hold a hearing on election security at the end of July. But asked if Mr. Trump should recalibrate his approach to the Putin meeting, Mr. Gowdy said, â€œThatâ€™s above my pay grade.â€\\x9d
 But Mr. Royce, of California, called Friday for Mr. Trump to â€œuse todayâ€™s indictments to challengeâ€\\x9d Mr. Putin at Mondayâ€™s summit meeting, adding, â€œWe canâ€™t afford to give an inch of ground in defending democracy.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Senate Democratsâ€™ Vote to End Shutdown Infuriates Some on the Left

Senate Democratsâ€™ Vote to End Shutdown Infuriates Some on the Left
 WASHINGTON â€” The decision by Senate Democrats to end the government shutdown on Monday in exchange for a promised immigration vote enraged liberals, who accused the lawmakers of betrayal and threatened to mount primaries against some of the Democrats who voted yes.
 Regardless of what happens in the Senate, progressive and immigrant advocacy groups said House Republican leaders will never take up a bill that would offer legal status to young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children without excruciating concessions on other immigration issues. They accused Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and moderate Democratic senators of capitulating to protect senators up for re-election in November in Republican-leaning states.
 â€œThey blinked because theyâ€™ll always put the party and the success of the party first,â€\\x9d said Representative Luis V. GutiÃ©rrez of Illinois, one of the leading Democratic advocates for immigrants, complaining that Hispanics got short shrift. â€œItâ€™s the one word they know in Spanish: maÃ±ana.â€\\x9d
 The hasty retreat by 33 Senate Democrats was particularly humiliating in the immediate aftermath of the anniversary of the Womenâ€™s March, which saw thousands of activists reconvene in cities across the country to protest against President Trump and congressional Republicans. Liberal groups such as MoveOn.org began urging members to sign up on Monday for rallies aimed at pressuring Republicans to protect the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers.
 By noon, their own ostensible allies in Congress had buckled.
 â€œThe grass-roots are rightly furious with a slew of elected Democrats,â€\\x9d said Ben Wikler, the Washington director of MoveOn.org. â€œIn the Obama years, Republicans learned to be more afraid of primary challenges than general elections. But Democrats are still operating as though the Tea Party is more powerful than The Resistance.â€\\x9d
 The anger on the left was reminiscent of conservative unrest that fueled primary race challenges against sitting Republican senators accused of appeasing an opposition president, Barack Obama, and his congressional allies.
 Mr. Schumer, determined to keep the fissures in his party coalition muted, used a meeting of Senate Democrats before the vote to urge the liberals in his caucus not to criticize those voting to reopen the government, according to one senator who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private meeting.
 And for the most part, the liberal senators who opposed the agreement held their fire. Democrats have largely avoided the internal insurrections that upended Republicans over the past decade. Mr. Schumer is not a figure of derision on the left as Mr. McConnell is on the right.
 And Senate Democrats have crushed most primary election challenges easily. Senate leaders have intervened freely in a number of 2018 races â€” in states like Arizona and Tennessee â€” to anoint more moderate standard-bearers.
 Former Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, said Democrats from the more rural states that make up much of the 2018 map would prefer to battle over issues other than immigration. The Obama-era program that protected young undocumented immigrants â€” Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA â€” is an important issue, he said, but â€œit isnâ€™t the bread and butter of successful Democrat politics.â€\\x9d
 â€œOur major issues are jobs, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, Social Security, infrastructure, supporting domestic programs, clean air, safe drinking water,â€\\x9d Mr. Dorgan said, adding of his conservative-state brethren, â€œWhile those Democrats do strongly support DACA, Iâ€™m sure they would prefer to be discussing different issues.â€\\x9d
 But the patience of the left may be running thin. By appearing to retreat on Monday, Democrats have stirred new talk on the left about challenging incumbents who had previously given little thought to their own nominations.
 Faiz Shakir, the political director of the American Civil Liberties Union and an adviser to former Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, said the group and its allies were actively exploring places to intervene in primary elections.
 Mr. Shakir said of some Democrats that it is an â€œopen question, still, whether theyâ€™re going to fight for Dreamers.â€\\x9d
 Right now, only one Democratic senator faces a serious primary challenge: Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, who voted against the government-funding deal and complained privately that she and most of her colleagues had been asked to vote on Friday against a nearly identical measure to keep the government open.
 Ms. Feinstein has tacked to the left since Kevin de LÃ©on, the president of the California State Senate, announced his challenge to her in October.
 Mr. de LÃ©on said Monday that Democrats had made a grave mistake striking â€œanother fingers-crossed bargain with Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell.â€\\x9d
 Mr. de LÃ©on said he had called and left a voice mail message with Thomas E. Perez, the Democratic National Committee chairman, and planned to convey that Democrats had sent a terrible message to â€œvoters of color and millennial voters who feel like theyâ€™ve been abandoned.â€\\x9d
 â€œOnce again, the partyâ€™s leaders in Washington have capitulated, compromised and redrawn a line in the sand even further away from justice,â€\\x9d he said.
 One House Democrat is already under fire for not taking a stronger stance on behalf of immigrants: Representative Daniel Lipinski of Illinois, a moderate Democrat from Chicago who is facing a primary race challenger, Marie Newman, in March.
 â€œI asked him to sign on to Dream bill. He said, â€˜I donâ€™t think I can do that,â€™â€\\x9d said Mr. GutiÃ©rrez, whoendorsed Ms. Newman last week. (Mr. Lipinski opposed the measure in 2010 but has said in recent months that he would support it if it comes to the House floor.)
 The chances of a successful primary election challenge in the Senate are far more remote. Many of the Democrats facing re-election in November hail from states that Mr. Trump carried and are more concerned about well-funded Republican opponents than liberal challengers.
 Of the 10 Democrats who gathered outside the Senate chamber after the vote to crow about their bipartisan agreement, six are on the ballot this year.
 â€œIf you want results, you have to compromise, and if youâ€™re unwilling to compromise, you wonâ€™t get results,â€\\x9d said Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota. â€œYou maybe get a political issue, but you wonâ€™t get results. And I didnâ€™t come here to do politics.â€\\x9d
 Progressives, however, are already eyeing one of the Democrats who pushed for a compromise: Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. On a conference call convened Sunday night by liberal groups, there was notable anger toward Ms. Klobuchar, according to two participants.
 Ms. Klobuchar, however, illustrates why the Democratic base may find it difficult to inflict payback: She is broadly popular with liberals in Minnesota, and the shutdown fight has come late enough in the congressional calendar to leave any would-be challenger with little time to prepare.
 â€œI have been working hard for the people of Minnesota, and I think the people of Minnesota understand that, including in my party,â€\\x9d Ms. Klobuchar said.

TITLE: F.B.I. Agent Peter Strzok, Who Criticized Trump in Texts, Is Fired

PUBLISHED: 2018/08/13

WASHINGTON â€” Peter Strzok, the F.B.I. senior counterintelligence agent who disparaged President Trump in inflammatory text messages and helped oversee the Hillary Clinton email and Russia investigations, has been fired for violating bureau policies, Mr. Strzokâ€™s lawyer said Monday.
 Mr. Trump and his allies seized on the texts â€” exchanged during the 2016 campaign with a former F.B.I. lawyer, Lisa Page â€” in assailing the Russia investigation as an illegitimate â€œwitch hunt.â€\\x9d  Mr. Strzok, who rose over 20 years at the F.B.I. to become one of its most experienced counterintelligence agents, was a key figure in the early months of the inquiry.
 Along with writing the texts, Mr. Strzok was accused of sending a highly sensitive search warrant to his personal email account.
 The F.B.I. had been under immense political pressure by Mr. Trump to dismiss Mr. Strzok, who was removed last summer from the staff of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.  The president has repeatedly denounced Mr. Strzok in posts on Twitter, and on Monday expressed satisfaction that he had been sacked.
 Mr. Trumpâ€™s victory traces back to June, when Mr. Strzokâ€™s conduct was laid out in a wide-ranging inspector generalâ€™s report on how the F.B.I. handled the investigation of Hillary Clintonâ€™s emails in the run-up to the 2016 election.  The report was critical of Mr. Strzokâ€™s conduct in sending the texts, and the bureauâ€™s Office of Professional Responsibility said that Mr. Strzok should be suspended for 60 days and demoted.  Mr. Strzok had testified before the House in July about how he had not allowed his political views to interfere with the investigations he was overseeing.
 But Mr. Strzokâ€™s lawyer said the deputy director of the F.B.I., David Bowdich, had overruled the Office of Professional Responsibility and fired Mr. Strzok.
 A spokeswoman for the F.B.I. did not respond to a message seeking comment about why Mr. Strzok was dismissed rather than demoted.  Firing Mr. Strzok, however, removes a favorite target of Mr. Trump from the ranks of the F.B.I. and gives Mr. Bowdich and the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, a chance to move beyond the presidentâ€™s ire.
 Aitan Goelman, Mr. Strzokâ€™s lawyer, denounced his clientâ€™s dismissal.  â€œThe decision to fire Special Agent Strzok is not only a departure from typical bureau practice, but also contradicts Director Wrayâ€™s testimony to Congress and his assurances that the F.B.I. intended to follow its regular process in this and all personnel matters,â€\\x9d Mr. Goelman said.
 â€œThis decision should be deeply troubling to all Americans,â€\\x9d Mr. Goelman added.  â€œA lengthy investigation and multiple rounds of congressional testimony failed to produce a shred of evidence that Special Agent Strzokâ€™s personal views ever affected his work.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Strzokâ€™s text exchanges with Ms. Page demonstrated animosity toward Mr. Trump.  In one, Ms. Page asks: Trump is â€œnot ever going to become president, right? Right?!â€\\x9d  Mr. Strzok responds: â€œNo. No he wonâ€™t. Weâ€™ll stop it.â€\\x9d  The inspector general, who uncovered the messages, found no evidence that the pair imposed their political views on their investigative decisions but cited that exchange as â€œnot only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidateâ€™s electoral prospects.â€\\x9d
 The report by the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, that preceded Mr. Strzokâ€™s firing not only criticized his conduct in sending the texts but also his use of personal email accounts to handle sensitive information.  In addition, the inspector general criticized Mr. Strzokâ€™s decision not to move swiftly to examine new emails related to the Clinton investigation just weeks before the 2016 election.
 Mr. Horowitz said in his report that he was â€œdeeply troubledâ€\\x9d by the text messages.  Hundreds exchanged over months were found in which the pair disparaged Mr. Trump and, to a lesser extent, Mrs. Clinton, exchanged work gossip and bantered.
 On Twitter, Mr. Strzok said he was â€œdeeply saddened by this decision,â€\\x9d adding, â€œIt has been an honor to serve my country and work with the fine men and women of the FBI.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Strzok became emblematic of Mr. Trumpâ€™s unfounded assertions that a so-called deep state of bureaucrats opposed to him was undermining his presidency.  Mr. Trump contended that Mr. Strzok targeted the president and accused Mr. Strzok of being â€œtreasonousâ€\\x9d and a â€œdisgrace.â€\\x9d  Mr. Strzok told lawmakers that he never leaked information about the Russia inquiry, which could have upended the election and hurt Mr. Trumpâ€™s chances of becoming president.
 After Mr. Horowitz uncovered the texts, Mr. Mueller, who had by then taken over the investigation, removed Mr. Strzok from his team.  He was reassigned to the F.B.I.â€™s human resources division.  Ms. Page, who had left Mr. Muellerâ€™s team before the discovery of the text messages, quit the F.B.I. in May.
 The inspector generalâ€™s report also took issue with the reaction by Mr. Strzok and other F.B.I. officials to the discovery of possible new evidence in the Clinton investigation, known internally as Midyear Exam, in late September 2016 on a laptop that belonged to the disgraced politician Anthony D. Weiner, the husband of a top Clinton aide.
 At the time, Mr. Strzok was in the early stages of investigating whether any Trump associates had conspired with Russiaâ€™s interference in the presidential election, and nearly a month passed before agents and analysts began to act on the emails found on Mr. Weinerâ€™s laptop.  Mr. Horowitz could not rule out that Mr. Strzok had slow-walked the examination of the new emails to help Mrs. Clintonâ€™s presidential bid.
 â€œUnder these circumstances, we did not have confidence that Strzokâ€™s decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the Midyear-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias,â€\\x9d he wrote.
 The delays were merely the â€œresult of bureaucratic snafus,â€\\x9d Mr. Strzokâ€™s lawyer wrote last month in USA Today.
 But the justifications for the delay were â€œunpersuasiveâ€\\x9d and had â€œfar-reaching consequences,â€\\x9d the inspector general said.  James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, has told investigators that if he had known about the emails earlier, it might have influenced his decision to alert Congress to their existence days before the election.
 In addition, the inspector general said that Mr. Strzok had forwarded a proposed search warrant to his personal email account.  The inspector general said the email, which included a draft of the search warrant affidavit, contained information that appeared to be under seal.
 In a heated congressional hearing last month, Mr. Strzok expressed â€œsignificant regretâ€\\x9d for the texts and rebutted the presidentâ€™s attacks on the Russia inquiry.  â€œThis investigation is not politically motivated; it is not a witch hunt; it is not a hoax,â€\\x9d he said.
 Mr. Strzokâ€™s dismissal was not unexpected.  He is the second senior F.B.I. agent to be fired as a result of the inspector generalâ€™s investigation.  In March, Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy director, was fired after the inspector general repeatedly faulted him for misleading investigators.
 The firing was politically motivated, Mr. McCabe has said, as an effort to discredit him as a witness in the special counsel investigation.
 Both men were fired before they were eligible for their pension and health benefits.
 Mr. Strzok, 48, a graduate of Georgetown University, served as an officer in the Army before he joined the F.B.I.  He held several key positions in the F.B.I., eventually becoming a top deputy in the counterintelligence division.
 He handled many important espionage cases including one involving a former C.I.A. officer suspected of working for China and a group of Russian spies who had been working undercover in the United States.

TITLE: Trump vows birthright citizenship â€˜will be ended one way or the other,â€™ as Hill debate rages

PUBLISHED: 2018/10/31

President Trump vowed Wednesday that birthright citizenship will end â€œone way or the other,â€\\x9d a day after it emerged he was considering killing the policy by executive order -- a development that sparked disagreement among Republicans and condemnation from Democrats.
 â€œSo-called Birthright Citizenship, which costs our Country billions of dollars and is very unfair to our citizens, will be ended one way or the other,â€\\x9d he tweeted.  "It is not covered by the 14th Amendment because of the words 'subject to the jurisdiction thereof.'"
 He also took aim at former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who he said â€œwas right in 1993, before he and the Democrats went insane and started with the Open Borders (which brings massive crime) â€˜stuff.â€™â€\\x9d
 He was referring to comments unearthed from 1993 in which Reid said that "no sane country" would award citizenship to children of illegal immigrants born on its soil and promoted legislation to end the practice.
 "If making it easy to be an illegal alien isn't enough, how about offering a reward for being an illegal immigrant?  No sane country would do that, right?" Reid said.  "Guess again.  If you break our laws by entering this country without permission and give birth to a child, we reward that child with U.S. citizenship and guarantee a full access to all public and social services this society provides."
 Reid later apologized for his stance and reversed it in 1999.
 But the comments helped Trump make his controversial case, after his push first emerged in an interview with â€œAxios on HBOâ€\\x9d.  He said he wants to use an executive order to end the practice by which children born in the U.S. of non-citizen or illegal immigrant parents are immediately a citizen.
 â€œHow ridiculous, weâ€™re the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits,â€\\x9d Trump said.
 The U.S. is not the only country to grant birthright citizenship, with Canada and a number of Latin American countries also doing so, but the issue has long been a contentious one in the U.S. -- particularly for those seeking to restrict illegal immigration into the U.S.
 The 14th Amendment states that â€œall persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.â€\\x9d  Critics of birthright citizenship say that the amendment was never intended to apply to children of two non-citizens -- and particularly those who have come to the country illegally.
 Critics say the policy encourages illegal immigrants to come to the country, give birth and then try to claim residency themselves as a result.
 But many scholars counter that it would take a constitutional amendment to change the policy.  And the announcement Tuesday was met with a mixed reception by lawmakers in Congress, particularly the idea that Trump might use an executive order to impose such a significant immigration change -- something Republicans blasted former President Barack Obama for doing with the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy.
 Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said in an interview with WVLK that the 14th Amendment is â€œpretty clearâ€\\x9d and said that â€œyou cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order.â€\\x9d  Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said he will "closely review" the proposed executive order, but said that "as a general matter, this is an issue that Congress should take the lead to carefully consider and debate."
 Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., announced he will be introducing legislation â€œto deal with the issue of birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrantsâ€\\x9d and said it was a â€œmagnet for illegal immigration in modern times.â€\\x9d
 On Wednesday, Trump appeared to shift stance somewhat by avoiding saying it would be ended by executive order, while acknowledging the matter â€œwill be settled by the United States Supreme Court.â€\\x9d
 Democrats appeared united in condemnation against Trumpâ€™s move this week.  In a Tuesday appearance on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the Axios interview didn't surprise her.
 "This is just more of the same of what he's been saying," she said, referring to Trump's remarks on immigration.  "What he was saying today has no relationship to what his authority is, but that's of course not unusual."

TITLE: Trump Says Defense Secretary Jim Mattis Will Retire In February

PUBLISHED: 2018/12/20

President Donald Trump tweeted on Thursday that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general who was one of Trumpâ€™s first Cabinet picks, would be retiring at the end of February.
 Mattis, who served more than four decades in the military and headed the U.S. Central Command from 2010 to 2013, won Senate confirmation as defense secretary on Jan. 20, 2017, shortly after Trumpâ€™s inauguration.
 The Pentagon chief, nicknamed â€œMad Dog Mattisâ€\\x9d during his time as a Marine, echoed Trumpâ€™s call for strengthening the military and beefing up its combat readiness. The budget bill the president signed into law in February earmarked $700 billion for the Defense Department this fiscal year â€• a more than 15 percent increase over the previous year and the biggest hike in military spending since 2002.
 Mattisâ€™ resignation letter addressed to Trump indicates his final day in office will be Feb. 28.
 â€œI am proud of the progress that has been made over the past two years on some of the key goals articulated in our National Defense Strategy: putting the Department on a more sound budgetary footing, improving readiness and lethality in our forces, and reforming the Departmentâ€™s business practices for greater performance, he wrote.
 â€œOur troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in conflict and sustain strong U.S. global influence.â€\\x9d
 In the unusual letter, Mattis also wrote that he and Trump had differing views on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism: â€œBecause you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.â€\\x9d
 Earlier this week, Trump went against Mattis by abruptly withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria. Mattis had previously argued that a small U.S. presence should remain because the counterterrorism mission there is ongoing and removing troops now would cause more problems for the region. Additionally, forces were withdrawn despite the concern by many Republicans that â€œleaving would strengthen the hand of Russia and Iran, which both support Syrian President Bashar al Assad.â€\\x9d
 News of Mattisâ€™ departure comes in the wake of reports that the White House had been discussing who might replace him, a topic that was first reported by The Washington Post in early September.
 Some of the top names that were reportedly under consideration included four-star Army Gen. Jack Keane, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), former Treasury Department official David McCormick and former Republican Sen. Jim Talent of Missouri.
 Trump denied that he had been looking to replace Mattis, telling reporters that he was â€œvery happyâ€\\x9d with him.
 That assurance came ahead of the release of a book by acclaimed Watergate journalist Bob Woodward, which reported that Mattis once told staffers that Trump has the understanding of a â€œfifth- or sixth-grader.â€\\x9d Mattis has denied having said that.
 A major split between Trump and Mattis concerned Russian President Vladimir Putin. The defense secretary has characterized Putin as trying to undermine NATO and assaulting Western democracies while violating international norms.
 â€œ[Putinâ€™s] actions are designed not to challenge our arms at this point, but to undercut and compromise our belief in our ideals,â€\\x9d Mattis told U.S. Naval War College graduates at a commencement ceremony in June.
 Trump, in contrast, has praised Putinâ€™s leadership skills and recently roiled U.S. allies by calling for Russiaâ€™s reinstatement to the Group of Seven major industrial nations. Russia was expelled from what was then the Group of Eight after its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.
 Mattis had also argued that the U.S. should consider staying in the Iran nuclear deal unless Tehran was found not to be abiding by the multi-nation agreement. Iran was following the pactâ€™s rules, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors the use of nuclear energy and has verified Iranian compliance with the accord multiple times since 2015.
 Trump went on to pull out of the deal in May, claiming that it had been poorly negotiated during the Obama administration.
 Mattis opposed Trumpâ€™s proposed ban on transgender service members, as well as the use of torture in the interrogation of terrorist suspects.
 His most prominent moment in the public spotlight occurred in April when he handled briefings on Trumpâ€™s decision to conduct targeted airstrikes against Syria in response to the alleged use of chemical weapons by Assadâ€™s regime in that nationâ€™s civil war.
 Even then, Mattisâ€™ recommendation that congressional approval be sought for the strikes put him at odds with the president. Trump overruled the defense secretary and unilaterally ordered the military assault.
 Mattis joins a growing list of high-profile departures from the administration. Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson earlier this year, and Tom Price stepped aside as secretary of health and human services last fall amid ethical questions about his travel practices.
 Reince Priebus lasted barely six months as White House chief of staff, and Sean Spicer had a similarly short tenure as press secretary.
 White House Communications Director Hope Hicks, a Trump aide before he won the presidency, announced her resignation in February.
 White House deputy chief of staff Joe Hagin, who also served in the Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush administrations, is expected to leave his post in July, Politico reported.

TITLE: Donald Trump's Social Media Solution? A Free-For-All For Both The 'Good And Bad'

PUBLISHED: 2018/08/18

President Donald Trump used Twitter to tear into social media companies Saturday morning, claiming they were â€œtotally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices.â€\\x9d
 But he does have a solution. Sort of. And it involves both sides.
 Trump tweeted that â€œtoo many voices are being destroyed, some good and some bad, and that cannot be allowed to happen.â€\\x9d So, he added: â€œLet everybody participate, good & bad, and we will all just have to figure it out!â€\\x9d
 Trump accused social media giants of â€œclosing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT, while at the same time doing nothing to others.â€\\x9d
 â€œCensorship is a very dangerous thing & impossible to police,â€\\x9d he added, before embarking on a now familiar rant about â€œfake newsâ€\\x9d CNN and MSNBC â€” which he admitted to sometimes watching, but â€œjust with a grain of salt.â€\\x9d
 Trump did not reference any person in particular in his tirade against the tech companies, although a host of them have in recent weeks banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from their platforms.

TITLE: Representative Duncan Hunter Is Indicted, Accused of Misusing Campaign Funds

PUBLISHED: 2018/08/21

WASHINGTON â€” Representative Duncan Hunter was indicted by a federal grand jury in San Diego on Tuesday after a monthslong criminal investigation into allegations that he spent tens of thousands of dollars in campaign funds on family trips to Hawaii and Italy, private school tuition for his children and even a $600 airline ticket for a pet rabbit.
 In a 48-page indictment released by the Justice Department, Mr. Hunter, Republican of California, and his wife, Margaret, are charged with converting more than $250,000 in campaign funds to pay for personal expenses and filing false campaign finance records with the Federal Election Commission.
 Mr. Hunter, 41, becomes the second Republican congressman to be indicted this month. Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York, was indicted on insider trading charges, and announced days later that he had suspended his re-election campaign. The two were the earliest congressional supporters of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump.
 Mr. Collins, who is accused of passing insider information to his son about a drug company on whose board he served, has said he expects to be â€œfully vindicated and exonerated.â€\\x9d
 A spokesman for Mr. Hunter, Michael Harrison, said Tuesday that the congressman â€œbelieves this action is purely politically motivated,â€\\x9d and referred a reporter to a letter that Mr. Hunterâ€™s lawyer, Gregory A. Vega, sent this month to Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general. Mr. Vega, anticipating an indictment, asserted in the letter that two prosecutors involved in the investigation had attended a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton, and complained that bringing charges so close to the election would effectively deliver a â€œsolidly Republicanâ€\\x9d House seat into Democratic hands.
 The back-to-back indictments are all but certain to give ammunition to Democrats, who have been promising to clean up corruption in Washington if voters give them control of the House.
 And for California Republicans, it has immediate implications, expanding from seven to eight the field of Republican-held seats being seriously targeted by Democrats. Mr. Hunter cannot take his name off the ballot, according to a spokesman for the California secretary of state, and California does not allow write-in candidates.
 Mr. Hunter easily won Californiaâ€™s nonpartisan primary with 48 percent of the vote; the next highest vote-getter, Ammar Campa-Najjar, a Democrat, took only 17 percent. Despite that, Democrats have long thought they could make a play for Mr. Hunterâ€™s seat, especially if he were indicted. At the very least, the indictment will require Republicans to spend money to defend the seat.
 â€œThe division, chaos and corruption in Washington has gone too far,â€\\x9d Mr. Campa-Najjar said in a statement. â€œTodayâ€™s indictment confirms just how deep this corruption can reach when someone like Duncan Hunter Jr. is in it for himself instead of representing the people.â€\\x9d
 The indictment details scores of instances, beginning in 2009 and continuing through 2016, in which the Justice Department said the Hunters spent campaign money on themselves. The department said that the improper use of campaign funds continued despite â€œnumerous warningsâ€\\x9d and â€œrepeated inquiriesâ€\\x9d from Mr. Hunterâ€™s campaign treasurer about questionable purchases.
 â€œThe indictment alleges that Congressman Hunter and his wife repeatedly dipped into campaign coffers as if they were personal bank accounts, and falsified F.E.C. campaign finance reports to cover their tracks,â€\\x9d Adam L. Braverman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of California, said in a statement, referring to the Federal Election Commission.
 â€œElected representatives should jealously guard the publicâ€™s trust, not abuse their positions for personal gain,â€\\x9d Mr. Braverman added. â€œTodayâ€™s indictment is a reminder that no one is above the law.â€\\x9d
 Beyond the family vacations and private school tuition, the indictment said expenses included dental work, theater tickets, and domestic and international travel for almost a dozen relatives, as well as â€œtens of thousands of dollars on smaller purchases, including fast food, movie tickets, golf outings, video games, coffee, groceries, home utilities and expensive meals,â€\\x9d according to a statement released by the Justice Department.
 The â€œcabin rabbit transport feesâ€\\x9d were first reported in January 2017 by a California newspaper, The Press-Enterprise.
 To conceal their personal spending, the Hunters mischaracterized the purchases as â€œcampaign travel,â€\\x9d â€œdinner with volunteers/contributors,â€\\x9d â€œtoy drives,â€\\x9d â€œteacher/parent and supporter events,â€\\x9d â€œgift cardsâ€\\x9d for charitable donations and â€œgift basket items,â€\\x9d the statement said.
 Family dental bills paid with campaign funds were characterized as a charitable contribution to â€œSmiles for Life.â€\\x9d Theater tickets were mischaracterized as â€œholiday gift certificates.â€\\x9d Tickets for the family to see the Irish dance show Riverdance at the San Diego Civic Theater became â€œSan Diego Civic Center for Republican Women Federated/Fund-raising.â€\\x9d
 The Hunters are scheduled to be arraigned Thursday morning in San Diego.
 A former Marine in Iraq and Afghanistan, Mr. Hunter was first elected in 2008 to a seat held by his father, and now serves on the House Armed Services Committee. He was for a time considered as a possible choice for defense secretary or another top job in the Trump administration, and told The San Diego Union-Tribune days after Mr. Trumpâ€™s election that he wanted to restore â€œa warrior culture, a warrior mentalityâ€\\x9d to the government.
 By March 2017, when the Justice Department opened its criminal investigation, Mr. Hunter was already being investigated by the House Ethics Committee. His lawyer said then that the congressman intended to cooperate fully and had already repaid about $60,000 to his campaign to correct for mistaken payments for personal items.

TITLE: Defense Secretary James Mattis to leave as of January 1; Trump taps Patrick Shanahan as acting secretary of defense

PUBLISHED: 2018/12/23

President Trump announced Sunday that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, weeks earlier than planned and just days after Mattis' bombshell resignation letter made clear his policy disagreements with the White House.
 "I am pleased to announce that our very talented Deputy Secretary of Defense, Patrick Shanahan, will assume the title of Acting Secretary of Defense starting January 1, 2019," Trump wrote on Twitter Sunday morning.
 "Patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as Deputy, & previously Boeing.
 He will be great!"
 Shanahan is a former Boeing executive who joined the Pentagon in July 2017.
 In his resignation letter Thursday, Mattis, 68, had said he would remain in his role for more than three months.
 Also on Thursday, Trump had said Mattis -- the first Cabinet official in 40 years to resign over a stated policy difference with the president -- was leaving in February.
 "The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed as well as to make sure the Department's interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February," Mattis wrote Thursday.
 It was not immediately clear why Mattis' departure date was apparently moved up, but tension in the Defense Department and Washington generally has skyrocketed in the days since he suddenly announced his resignation.
 Sources told Fox News this week that Mattis had quit "in protest" over the president's national security policies and that more resignations could be coming.
 (In 2013, then-President Obama removed Mattis from his post running U.S. military's Central Command, reportedly without calling to notify him of the decision.)
 U.S. officials said this week that the Trump administration is making plans to pull all 2,000 troops out of Syria, and Trump later tweeted that â€œwe have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.â€\\x9d
 Trump has stood by his Syria decision despite fierce blowback, telling detractors that the pullout should come as â€œno surpriseâ€\\x9d given his 2016 campaign promises and arguing that Americaâ€™s role as â€œPoliceman of the Middle Eastâ€\\x9d is not worth the sacrifice.
 Ground troops moved into Syria in 2015 to combat ISIS in the region, amid an escalating Syrian civil war.
 Trump had talked about pulling out of Syria before, but military leaders had warned about ISIS re-emerging should the U.S. do so.
 There is also concern about abandoning the U.S.' Kurdish allies.
 The news that Mattis will be leaving sooner than expected comes just days after Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the global coalition to defeat Islamic State (ISIS), on Saturday accelerated his planned departure and announced his resignation.
 The Associated Press reported that McGurk said in a resignation letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that ISIS was on the run, but wasnâ€™t yet defeated and that U.S. work in Syria wasnâ€™t yet done.
 Fox News has confirmed that McGurk submitted his resignation letter on Friday, a day after Mattis resigned.
 His resignation is effective December 31.
 The president downplayed the news via Twitter Saturday evening, saying he had neither met McGurk nor appointed him.
 "Brett McGurk, who I do not know, was appointed by President Obama in 2015.
 Was supposed to leave in February but he just resigned prior to leaving," Trump tweeted.
 "Grandstander? The Fake News is making such a big deal about this nothing event!"
 "If anybody but your favorite President, Donald J. Trump, announced that, after decimating ISIS in Syria, we were going to bring our troops back home (happy & healthy), that person would be the most popular hero in America," he continued in a follow-up tweet.
 "With me, hit hard instead by the Fake News Media. Crazy!"
 Meanwhile, the White House's plan to withdraw half its troops in Afghanistan by the summer -- some 7,000 soldiers -- has drawn similar criticism.
 While President Obama repeatedly promised to pull all troops out of Afghanistan by 2014, U.S. and NATO forces remain there in a predominately training and advising role.
 Afghanistan's security forces rely heavily on U.S. airpower against both Taliban and an upstart Islamic State affiliate.
 More than 2,400 American soldiers have died in Afghanistan since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion, and Trump announced in a video last week that troop deaths were on his mind in announcing the pullouts.

TITLE: FBI fires Peter Strzok, months after anti-Trump texts revealed

PUBLISHED: 2018/08/13

FBI official Peter Strzok, who played a lead role in both the Russian meddling and Hillary Clinton email probes but became a political lightning rod after the revelation of anti-Trump text messages, has been fired.
 Strzok attorney Aitan Goelman said in a statement Monday that his client, a 21-year FBI veteran, was fired Friday afternoon, claiming this was a departure from standard practice and politically motivated.  Goelman said bureau Deputy Director David Bowdich â€œoverruledâ€\\x9d the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility to remove him.
 â€œThis decision should be deeply troubling to all Americans,â€\\x9d the attorney said.
 The FBI responded: â€œMr. Strzok was subject to the standard FBI review and disciplinary process after conduct highlighted in the IG report was referred to the FBIâ€™s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR).  OPR reviewed the investigative materials, as well as the written and oral responses of Mr. Strzok and his counsel, and issued OPR's decision.  The Deputy Director, as the senior career FBI official, has the delegated authority to review and modify any disciplinary findings and/or penalty as deemed necessary in the best interest of the FBI.â€\\x9d
 Strzok appeared to launch a new Twitter account to fire back, saying he's "deeply saddened" by the decision and linking to a GoFundMe page.
 President Trump and his allies for months, though, have hammered the former FBI agent and cast him as the poster child for anti-Trump bias within the bureau and Justice Department.
 Reacting to the firing, the president tweeted, "finally," while asking whether the Russia case will now be dropped:
 "Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI - finally.  The list of bad players in the FBI & DOJ gets longer & longer.  Based on the fact that Strzok was in charge of the Witch Hunt, will it be dropped?  It is a total Hoax.  No Collusion, No Obstruction - I just fight back!"
 The president over the weekend had tweeted that Strzok and others have â€œbadly damagedâ€\\x9d the FBIâ€™s reputation, referring to them as â€œclowns and losers!â€\\x9d
 Strzok was removed from the special counsel probe last year after the discovery that he exchanged anti-Trump and other politically charged messages with colleague and lover Lisa Page.
 Judicial Watch Director of Investigations Chris Farrell on how FBI official Peter Strzok requested that he retain his security clearance after being added to special counsel Robert Mueller's team.  In June, he was then escorted from his FBI office and lost his security clearance amid the release of a scathing DOJ inspector general report that largely dealt with the DOJ and FBIâ€™s handling of the investigation into Clintonâ€™s private email server but uncovered messages that â€œappeared to mix political opinion with discussionsâ€\\x9d about that probe -- namely, between Strzok and Page.
 The IG ultimately found no evidence that the bias among the several FBI agents impacted prosecutorial decisions in the Clinton email probe.  But Republicans have repeatedly raised concerns that anti-Trump bias played a role in the start of the investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump associates in 2016.
 One Strzok text in particular vowed to "stop" Trump from becoming president.
 In an explosive congressional hearing last month, Strzok sought to clear his name and address the many controversial messages.  He claimed his personal opinions did not affect his work. But Republicans tore into the FBI official, with House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy saying he exhibited "textbook bias."
 Trump's allies cheered the former agent's termination on Monday.
 "Peter Strzok was fired from the FBI because of what his own written words plainly showed:  he was willing to use his official FBI position to try and stop President Trump from getting elected.  He tarnished the FBI's sterling reputation and severely damaged public trust in an institution where trust is paramount.  His conduct should deeply concern every American," House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said in a statement to Fox News.
 Strzokâ€™s attorney, meanwhile, blasted the bureau on Monday, saying the deputy director â€œreversed the decision of the career FBI official responsible for employee discipline who concluded, through an independent review process, that a 60-day suspension and demotion from supervisory duties was the appropriate punishment.â€\\x9d
 He added, â€œA lengthy investigation and multiple rounds of Congressional testimony failed to produce a shred of evidence that Special Agent Strzokâ€™s personal views ever affected his work.â€\\x9d
 The Justice Department declined to comment for this report.
 Text messages first emerged last year, showing Strzok and Page discussing 2016 campaign politics and repeatedly blasting Trump.  In one message, Strzok called Trump an "idiot."
 Messages continued to trickle out, including some reflecting apparent concern about being too tough on Clinton during the investigation into her private email system use.
 The inspector general report, meanwhile, referred a total of five FBI employees for investigation in connection with politically charged texts, suggesting more disciplinary action could be considered for additional employees.  Lisa Page left the bureau earlier this year.

TITLE: Liberals Fume At 'Worst Negotiator' Chuck Schumer After Deal To End Shutdown

Liberals Fume At 'Worst Negotiator' Chuck Schumer After Deal To End Shutdown
 WASHINGTON â€• Democrats provided votes to fund the government on Monday in exchange for an assurance from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that he would put an immigration bill on the floor in the coming weeks.
 Liberal groups, which are deeply skeptical whether Republicans will keep their word after years of inaction on codifying protections for the undocumented young people often called Dreamers, angrily slammed Democrats â€• and in particular Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) â€• for giving away leverage with no firm promise that an immigration bill would reach President Donald Trumpâ€™s desk.
 â€œItâ€™s official: Chuck Schumer is the worst negotiator in Washington â€• even worse than Trump. Any plan to protect Dreamers that relies on the word of serial liars like Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan or Donald Trump is doomed to fail,â€\\x9d CREDO Political Director Murshed Zaheed said in a statement.
 CREDO Action, the activist arm of the wireless phone company, advocates for progressive causes, including immigrants rights and the passage of legislation that would give Dreamers a pathway to citizenship.
 MoveOn.org, one of the most influential progressive organizations in Washington, similarly panned the agreement that 33 Senate Democrats voted to advance to a final vote on Monday.
 â€œThis is a bad, outrageous deal. Trump and Republicans in Congress stood with their anti-immigrant nativist base, and too many Democrats backed down, abandoned Dreamers, and failed to fight for their values,â€\\x9d MoveOn.org Political Action Executive Director Ilya Sheyman said in a statement.
 McConnell said over the weekend that he intends to move to vote on an immigration bill if both parties canâ€™t agree to one by Feb. 8, as long as the government is still fully open. The admission left some Senate Democrats encouraged by the prospect of a bipartisan solution â€• even if they have no guarantee from House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) that it will pass in the House.
 â€œI believe Sen. McConnell will follow through,â€\\x9d independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, told reporters on Monday. â€œI think heâ€™s made his commitments so publicly and so unequivocally.â€\\x9d
 Other Democrats, such as Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.), remained unconvinced that McConnell and the House Republicans would follow through on immigration.
 â€œI donâ€™t believe he made any commitment whatsoever and I think it would be foolhardy to believe that he made a commitment,â€\\x9d Harris said.
 While Senate Democrats did not receive everything they asked for in exchange for voting to reopen the government, they did manage to get the Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance Program funded for six years. And if McConnell doesnâ€™t follow through on immigration, Democrats will still be able to use his promise to vote against the next spending bill on Feb. 8 and pin the blame on Republicans.
 For now, though, Democrats who voted to reopen the government said that simply pushing the conversation in the right direction was a victory on its own.
 â€œI donâ€™t think I can guarantee a House outcome but I think the stronger the bill, in terms of the strength of the bipartisanship in the bill â€• the odds go up in the House,â€\\x9d Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) told HuffPost on Monday.

TITLE: Trump Accuses Social Media Firms of Discrimination Against Conservatives

PUBLISHED: 2018/08/18

BERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J. â€” President Trump said on Saturday that conservative voices were being unfairly censored on social media, hinting that he might intervene if his alliesâ€™ accounts continued to be shut down.
 â€œSocial Media is totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices,â€\\x9d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, saying that â€œcensorship is a very dangerous thing.â€\\x9d
 â€œSpeaking loudly and clearly for the Trump Administration, we wonâ€™t let that happen,â€\\x9d he added.
 Social media companies, facing pressure from lawmakers and users over their role in the rise of misinformation and partisan division, have promised to step up their enforcement practices.  They have banned a number of pages and accounts in recent weeks for being involved in activity intended to disrupt the midterm elections, and almost all of the major platforms removed content from Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist, this month over what they called hateful and violent speech.
 After the content from Mr. Jones and his website, Infowars, was removed, he issued a plea to Mr. Trump to block the companiesâ€™ actions and â€œcome out before the midterms and make the censorship the big issue.â€\\x9d
 In the same video appeal, Mr. Jones urged Mr. Trump to â€œpoint out that the communist Chinese have penetrated and infiltratedâ€\\x9d the American election system and are â€œway, way worse than the Russians.â€\\x9d
 Minutes after his tweets on Saturday morning about social media, the president â€” who has long had an affinity for conspiracy theories â€” appeared to do just that.
 â€œAll of the fools that are so focused on looking only at Russia should start also looking in another direction, China,â€\\x9d Mr. Trump wrote.  â€œBut in the end, if we are smart, tough and well prepared, we will get along with everyone!
 Mr. Trumpâ€™s tweets on Saturday, sent from his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., were not the first time he has accused social media companies of discriminating against Republicans.  Last month, he joined with prominent conservatives who have seized on the heightened enforcement of guidelines and the concept of shadow banning on Twitter â€” making social media posts invisible to everyone except the posters themselves â€” as proof of biased attacks on their views.
 Twitter has said that it does not shadow ban users, although it has struggled to define what its policies against hate speech are.  In the case of Mr. Jones, it did not initially join the other major platforms in removing his content, and has since taken relatively minor steps against him.
 Mr. Jones has had his posts and videos on his personal account and on Infowars severely restricted or removed by Apple, Facebook, Google and Spotify.  Twitter, which initially said Mr. Jones and Infowars had not violated its policies, later suspended the two accounts for a week for violating rules against inciting violence.
 In his tweets on Saturday, Mr. Trump urged social media companies to â€œlet everybody participate, good & bad,â€\\x9d saying that while networks like CNN and MSNBC might be â€œfake news,â€\\x9d he does not â€œask that their sick behavior be removed.â€\\x9d
 Yet Mr. Trump has waged relentless attacks on news coverage that he does not like, and has long expressed hostility toward traditional press freedoms.  He has vowed to â€œopen upâ€\\x9d the nationâ€™s libel laws, even though those statutes are in fact state, not federal, laws.

TITLE: Suspect arrested in Florida in connection with suspicious packages sent to Democrats

PUBLISHED: 2018/10/26

A male suspect was arrested in Florida on Friday morning in connection with the rash of suspicious packages sent to prominent Democrats nationwide, law enforcement sources confirmed to Fox News.
 Multiple sources identified the suspect to Fox News as Cesar Sayoc of Aventura, Florida.
 A separate law enforcement source told Fox News that the suspect is a white male in his 50s, who used to live in New York and had prior arrests for terroristic threats.  Several of the packages went through a U.S. postal facility in Opa-locka, which is less than 10 miles from Aventura.
 The Department of Justice will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.
 Federal authorities had been focusing on Florida as the location where the majority of packages originated.
 â€œSome of the packages went through the mail,â€\\x9d Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen earlier told Fox News.  â€œThey originated, some of them, from Florida.  I am confident that this person or people will be brought to justice.â€\\x9d
 The Miami-Dade County Police Department confirmed Thursday it was helping federal agents who were at the facility in Opa-locka as part of the ongoing investigation.
 The USPS operates an innovative imaging system that photographs each piece of mail processed throughout the country.  Investigators were likely relying on that system to pinpoint where some of the packages were mailed.
 The FBI said the packages each consisted of a manila envelope with a bubble-wrap interior containing potentially destructive devices.  The packages were addressed with a computer-printed address label and six stamps.
 A government source told Fox News the FBI was analyzing the stamps in Quantico.  The source also said the investigation had progressed â€œsignificantlyâ€\\x9d and that the FBI was reaching out to retailers to zero in on where the elements of the bombs were made and where they were sold.
 The envelopes and packaging materials likely contained a treasure trove of DNA information.  Tiny bits of genetic material â€“ traces of sweat, skin cells, saliva, hair or fingerprints â€“ are typically used as a roadmap to the suspectâ€™s door, investigators and bomb experts say.
 The Washington, D.C., field office and the FBI headquarters had 24 teams in place and on the hunt for the culprit.
 Forensic investigators in Quantico, Va., have been sifting through the packages addressed to former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, liberal billionaire George Soros, former Attorney General Eric Holder, former CIA Director John Brennan and California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters.
 The devices are thought to have been fashioned from crude, bomb-making designs widely available on the Internet.  Authorities havenâ€™t said whether the devices were built to explode and kill or simply sow fear.
 Ryan Morris, founder of Tripwire Operation Group, a company that provides explosives training to law enforcement and military officials, called the devices â€œMickey Mouseâ€\\x9d bombs that were meant to be found.  He told Fox News he believes the primary motive is fear.  The packages were sent about two weeks ahead of the midterm elections.
 Regardless, investigators were treating the devices as â€œliveâ€\\x9d explosives New York City Police Commissioner James Oâ€™Neill said.
 Larry Johnson, a former head of criminal investigations for the U.S. Secret Service who also served as a special agent in charge of the presidential protective detail, agreed that bomb makers usually leave evidence â€“ and their signature- behind.
 â€œIf there is a human involved, there is a high probability youâ€™re going to get somewhere investigatively,â€\\x9d he told The Associated Press.  â€œThere will be no stone left unturned.â€\\x9d
 Johnson believes itâ€™s â€œhighly likelyâ€\\x9d the person who built the bombs will have been previously flagged by law enforcement.  The Secret Service maintains a wide database of groups and individuals who have made threats in the past against presidents or other top political leaders and activists via email, letters or on social media.
 James Fitzgerald, a retired FBI profiler and forensic linguist who, in 1996, helped catch "Unabomber" Ted Kaczynski -- who killed 3 people and injured 23 in bombings between 1978 and 1995 -- told Fox News on Wednesday that the letter sent to John Brennan, the former director of the CIA and a staunch Trump critic, reminded him of something the Unabomber would send because of the number of stamps used on the package.
 â€œThe linguist in me noticed that Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the last name is spelled missing a â€˜câ€™ and John Brennanâ€™s name is spelled missing an â€˜nâ€™ and that kind of surprised me and I have a feeling that was done on purpose to make this look like somebody who doesnâ€™t really know who these people are and that it wasnâ€™t an honest mistake.  If he had this much anger and vitriol against these people, you would think he would know how to spell their names

Trump Attacks Justice Department As 'Deep State,' Calls For Jailing Top Clinton Aide
 WASHINGTON â€• President Donald Trump on Tuesday renewed his attack on his â€œdeep stateâ€\\x9d Justice Department, and said a top aide to 2016 election rival Hillary Clinton should be jailed.
 Trump, returning to Washington after spending the holidays at his Florida resort, posted an early-morning tweet lashing out at former Clinton aide Huma Abedin, apparently in response to Abedin emails released by the State Department on Friday.
 The emails, disclosed in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by the conservative group Judicial Watch, were uncovered during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to Politico, part of the FBIâ€™s probe into Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. Abedin reportedly forwarded State Department emails, including some that contained passwords, to a personal account. Trump and his right-wing allies continue to raise the issue.
 Trump also said in his tweet that the Justice Department must act on â€œComey and others,â€\\x9d a reference to former FBI Director James Comey, who was leading the investigation into whether Trumpâ€™s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election until Trump fired him in May.
 Trump, in tweets and interviews, has repeatedly sought to undermine his Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe has intensified. He has criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions numerous times for recusing himself from supervising the Russia investigation, and claims to have the right to direct government investigations himself.
 Last week, Trump asserted in a New York Times interview that he had the â€œabsolute right to do what I want to do with the Justice Department.â€\\x9d

TITLE: John McCain, Top Democrats Call On Trump To Cancel Putin Meeting

PUBLISHED: 2018/07/13

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and 18 members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee called on President Donald Trump to cancel his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin after indictments were announced Friday accusing a dozen Kremlin intelligence officers of hacking Democratic Party emails during the 2016 presidential campaign.
 But a senior administration source told NBC on Friday that there was â€œzeroâ€\\x9d chance the controversial private meeting between the two men would be canceled.
 McCain tweeted that if Trump â€œis not prepared to hold Putin accountable,â€\\x9d the talks in Helsinki on Monday â€œshould not move forward.â€\\x9d
 He said the indictments are evidence of an â€œextensive plotâ€\\x9d by Putinâ€™s government to â€œattack the 2016 election, sow chaos and dissension among the American electorate, and undermine faith in our democracy.â€\\x9d
 Schumer said in a statement that â€œglad-handing with Vladimir Putin on the heels of these indictments would be an insult to our democracy.â€\\x9d He said the one-on-one meeting should not take place until â€œRussia takes demonstrable and transparent steps to prove that they wonâ€™t interfere in future elections.â€\\x9d
 Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted tersely to Trump to â€œcancel your ridiculous Putin summit and get your butt on a plane back to the United States.â€\\x9d
 Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, also said he is concerned that Putin will take â€œfull advantage of an ill-preparedâ€\\x9d Trump. The president has said he plans to meet with the Russian leader alone. â€œThere should be no one-on-one meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin,â€\\x9d Warner told reporters Friday.
 Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) also called for the cancellation of the meeting, saying that Trump â€œcannot claim to love the U.S. while meeting with ... a man who is overseeing an all-out attack on Americaâ€™s democracy.â€\\x9d He was one of several members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee who signed a letter calling on Trump to cancel.
 Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) tweeted to Trump: â€œDonâ€™t hand another dictator a propaganda victory.â€\\x9d
 Most Republicans were keeping mum. A terse response from the GOP only said: â€œNo collusion.â€\\x9d But the investigation is ongoing, and there hasnâ€™t yet been a determination on possible collusion with the Trump campaign.
 The indictments did reveal that attempts to hack into Democratic Party emails occurred later the same day that Trump called on Russians in a speech to uncover emails that his rival Hillary Clinton had held on a private server.
 â€œI will tell you this, Russia: If youâ€™re listening, I hope youâ€™re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,â€\\x9d Trump said at a Florida news conference on July 27, 2016. â€œI think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.â€\\x9d
 White House officials were reportedly furious that the indictments were announced by U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Friday morning, just days before the planned summit with Putin.
 â€œItâ€™s a big F-U from [special prosecutor Robert] Mueller,â€\\x9d a White House official told Politico, adding that it â€œwasnâ€™t an accidentâ€\\x9d that the indictments were announced before the Helsinki summit.

TITLE: Trump says 'too many voices are being destroyed' by social media censorship

PUBLISHED: 2018/08/18

President Trump on Saturday took aim at social media tech giants for â€œdiscriminatingâ€\\x9d against Republicans and conservatives -- saying that â€œtoo many voices are being destroyedâ€\\x9d and promising that his administration would not allow it to happen.
 â€œWho is making the choices, because I can already tell you that too many mistakes are being made.  Let everybody participate, good & bad, and we will all just have to figure it out!â€\\x9d he said at the end of a lengthy post on Twitter.
 Both Facebook and Twitter have been under fire for allegedly censoring accounts, while ignoring rules violations by liberal and left-wing users.  Trump in the past has referred to alleged â€œshadow banningâ€\\x9d by Twitter as â€œdiscriminatory and illegal.â€\\x9d
 Trump uses Twitter on a daily basis, and his campaign was credited for its use of Facebook as one of the ways it secured its victory in November 2016.
 While conservatives have complained for years about what they say is discrimination by the tech giants, the controversy escalated last month when Vice News reported the issue, saying that accounts from top Republicans including GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel were being given limited visibility on Twitter.  Twitter at the time said it was an algorithmic glitch that has since been fixed.
 "We do not shadow ban.  You are always able to see the tweets from accounts you follow (although you may have to do more work to find them, like go directly to their profile).  And we certainly donâ€™t shadow ban based on political viewpoints or ideology," the tech giant said in a statement.
 "We do rank tweets and search results.  We do this because Twitter is most useful when itâ€™s immediately relevant.  These ranking models take many signals into consideration to best organize tweets for timely relevance," the statement said.  "We must also address bad-faith actors who intend to manipulate or detract from healthy conversation."
 A Facebook executive apologized last month for mistreating Diamond and Silk -- two pro-Trump personalities who have long claimed they are being censored by the platform, but the company has also denied being biased against conservatives.
 â€œWe badly mishandled our communications with them,â€\\x9d Monika Bickert, head of Global Policy Management at Facebook, said at a House Judiciary Committee hearing.
 But that has done little to calm the controversy, and Trump on Saturday accused social media sites of â€œclosing down the opinions of many people on the right, while at the same time doing nothing to others.â€\\x9d
 "Too many voices are being destroyed, some good & some bad, and that cannot be allowed to happen," he tweeted.
 He went on to call censorship â€œa dangerous thingâ€\\x9d and then took a swipe at CNN and MSNBC, saying that while they are â€œfake,â€\\x9d he does not demand that offending content be taken off air.
 â€œIf you are weeding out Fake News, there is nothing so Fake as CNN & MSNBC, & yet I do not ask that their sick behavior be removed,â€\\x9d he tweeted.  â€œI get used to it and watch with a grain of salt, or donâ€™t watch at all..â€\\x9d

TITLE: Cesar Sayoc Identified As Mail Bomb Suspect

PUBLISHED: 2018/10/26

Police have arrested a suspect in connection with at least a dozen packages containing likely pipe bombs mailed in the past week to people critical of President Donald Trump.
 Cesar Sayoc, 56, of South Florida was taken into custody on Friday, FBI Director Chris Wray confirmed at a press conference.
 Sayoc has been charged with five federal crimes â€• interstate transportation of an explosive, illegal mailing of explosives, making threats against former presidents and certain other persons, threatening interstate communications, and assaulting current and former federal officers â€• the Department of Justice said. He faces up to 48 years in prison.
 In remarks at the White House before a youth leadership summit, Trump congratulated local and national law enforcement agencies for apprehending the suspect. The president pledged to prosecute those responsible â€• â€œthem, him, her, whoever it may be,â€\\x9d he said â€• to the fullest extent of the law.
 â€œWe must never allow political violence to take root in America,â€\\x9d Trump said.
 â€œThe bottom line is that Americans must unify,â€\\x9d he went on. His comments echoed those he has delivered at rallies and sent over Twitter in the wake of the bomb scares, calling for unity and a calmer discourse but refusing to tone down his own inflammatory rhetoric.
 Minutes after addressing the threats to prominent Democrats, Trump claimed Republicans are often attacked for supporting him. â€œCome to think of it, does anyone get attacked more than me?â€\\x9d Trump said.
 The development came hours after two additional packages were discovered, one addressed to Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and the other to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.
 A suspicious package was also found Friday in Burlingame, California, addressed to Democratic donor Tom Steyer, CNN and NBC reported. A law enforcement source told CNN the package was similar to the other ones sent to politicians and public figures this week.
 â€œWeâ€™re thankful that everyone we work with at NextGen America and Need to Impeach is safe,â€\\x9d Steyer said in a statement Friday, referring to his super PAC NextGen and his campaign to impeach Trump. â€œWe are seeing a systematic attack on our democracy and our rule of law that extends much further than just one isolated terrorist in Florida. Whether itâ€™s voter suppression, voter intimidation, attacks on our free press, gerrymandering, or attempted violence â€• the trust and norms that are the actual basis for our civil society and political system are being eroded.â€\\x9d
 Authorities have heightened their search in Florida, as several of the packages may have passed through the state. The FBI said Friday that the package for Booker was found in a Florida mail facility.
 Throughout the week, more than 10 packages containing potential explosive devices have been mailed to lawmakers and other public figures critical of Trump, including former President Barack Obama, former President Bill Clinton, Trumpâ€™s 2016 presidential opponent Hillary Clinton, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), actor Robert De Niro and former CIA Director John Brennan.
 The package addressed Brennan was sent to CNNâ€™s New York City bureau, sparking an evacuation Wednesday. Brennan is an MSNBC and NBC contributor. On Friday, postal officials intercepted the package for Clapper, a CNN contributor, before it could reach the CNN offices, where it was addressed, according to the network.
 The Sacramento County Sheriff Department also said Friday that a suspicious package found at a Sacramento mail facility and addressed to Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) contained an explosive device. FBI officials said they believed the package to be related to the others mailed out this week.
 All of the confirmed packages listed the Florida office of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, as the return address.
 Asked why Sayoc appeared to be targeting Democratic politicians and others critical of Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he didnâ€™t know but that the suspect â€œappears to be a partisanâ€\\x9d
 Wray added: â€œItâ€™s too early at this stage to discuss motive.â€\\x9d
 Investigators identified Sayoc based on a fingerprint found on the package sent to Waters and a DNA sample from a previous arrest in Florida, DOJ officials said Friday.
 When law enforcement arrested him on Friday in Plantation, Florida, they also took possession of a van covered in stickers supporting Trump and criticizing Democratic officials.
 Sayoc is a registered Republican and a self-described promoter and booking agent. He has a history of multiple arrests, including for felony grand theft and misdemeanor retail theft.
 A spokeswoman for Brevard College in North Carolina confirmed to HuffPost that Sayoc attended the school for three semesters starting in the fall of 1980 and did not graduate.
 Authorities were initially vague about the content of the packages, calling them simply â€œsuspected explosive devices.â€\\x9d Wray elaborated at Fridayâ€™s press briefing that each device contained roughly 6 inches of PVC pipe, as well as a small clock and wiring. â€œThese are not hoax devices,â€\\x9d he said.
 Wray noted that the investigation was ongoing and warned there could be other packages not yet intercepted.

TITLE: Pipe Bomb Suspect Arrested in Southern Florida

PUBLISHED: 2018/10/26

Federal authorities made an arrest on Friday in connection with the nationwide bombing campaign against outspoken critics of President Trump, a significant breakthrough in a case that has gripped the country in the days leading up to the midterm elections.
 A law enforcement official identified the suspect as Cesar Sayoc Jr., 56, of Aventura, Fla., just north of Miami.
 Mr. Sayoc, a registered Republican, has a lengthy criminal history in Florida dating back to 1991 that includes felony theft, drug and fraud charges, as well as being arrested and accused of threatening to use a bomb, public records show.
 His criminal record from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement indicates that at the time of his last arrest in 2015, he was 5-foot-11 and 215 pounds.  He has brown eyes, black hair and a scar on his left arm, the records said, and was born in New York.  The records listed Mr. Sayocâ€™s occupation as â€œmanager.â€\\x9d
 According to a 2012 bankruptcy petition filed in Miami, Mr. Sayoc resided at the time at his motherâ€™s home.  â€œLives w/mom,â€\\x9d a handwritten note on the petition said.  â€œHas no furniture.â€\\x9d
 On Friday morning, the authorities surrounded a white van with pro-Trump stickers on it, and television news later showed images of the authorities hauling the van away on a truck underneath a tarp.  But it remained unclear if the van belonged to Mr. Sayoc.
 Some residents of Aventura reported seeing a similar white van covered in pro-Trump stickers often parked in the lot of a local strip mall, the Aventura Waterways shopping center.  But it was not immediately clear if that van was the same one seized by the police on Friday.
 â€œIt struck me because of the crazy conspiratorial stickers covering the windows,â€\\x9d said David Cypkin, a documentary film producer and editor with the Rakontur production company.  â€œIt was unsettling, and also it seemed to be occupied.  Sometimes the door would be ajar or a window would be open, which indicated to me that maybe somebody was living in the van.â€\\x9d
 Speaking at the White House on Friday, Mr. Trump praised law enforcement officials for quickly arresting a suspect.
 â€œThese terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country,â€\\x9d he said.
 He added: â€œWe must never allow political violence to take root in America.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Sayocâ€™s arrest came only hours after the mysterious spate of pipe bombs spread further as federal authorities said on Friday morning that they had found two more of the explosive devices: one addressed to Senator Cory Booker and the other to James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence.
 Although no formal charges have been filed yet in the case, two of the law enforcement officials said there was a high likelihood that Mr. Sayoc would be prosecuted at least in part in Federal District Court in Manhattan.  The F.B.I.â€™s New York office has been leading the investigation and five of the bombs sent this week fall under the jurisdiction of the United States attorneyâ€™s office in Manhattan.
 The package addressed to Mr. Clapper was meant to be delivered to the New York offices of CNN, where he works as an analyst, but was intercepted at a mail facility in Midtown Manhattan, police officials in New York City said.  The package addressed to Mr. Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, was found in Florida, which two people briefed on the matter have said has become a focus of the intense, nationwide investigation into the bombs.
 At a news conference on Friday morning, John Miller, the New York Police Departmentâ€™s deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism, said a postal worker at the mail facility on 52nd Street recognized the package addressed to Mr. Clapper as similar to other suspicious packages discovered this week and â€œfroze it in the system.â€\\x9d
 The departmentâ€™s bomb squad responded to the facility and secured the package for delivery to an F.B.I. lab in Quantico, Va., Mr. Miller said.
 Speaking on CNN on Friday, Mr. Clapper said he was not surprised that a device had been sent to him.  He has been a frequent critic of President Trump, a similarity shared with everyone whose names have appeared on the packages discovered so far.
 â€œThis is definitely domestic terrorism,â€\\x9d Mr. Clapper said.  â€œAnyone who has in any way been a critic, publicly been a critic of President Trump, needs to be on an extra alert.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Clapper also said that on Wednesday night he had taken precautions after the first packages were discovered.  While he and his wife were away from their home this week, he added, he told his neighbor not to collect their mail.
 All together, 12 crude explosive devices have been found since Monday, sent through the mail to a host of Democrats and other prominent figures who have been among Mr. Trumpâ€™s most vocal detractors.  The packages â€” virtually identical in plain manila envelopes â€” have been addressed to former President Barack Obama; former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; Representative Maxine Waters of California; former Attorney General Eric Holder; John O. Brennan, a former C.I.A. director, the actor Robert De Niro; and George Soros, the billionaire Democratic donor.
 All of the envelopes had return address labels bearing the misspelled name of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat whose district is in southern Florida.  None of the devices inside have exploded on their own so far, and investigators are still seeking to determine whether they were even capable of detonating.  But the authorities in New York and elsewhere have warned that the devices should be considered dangerous.
 The first package was discovered on Monday afternoon at the suburban New York home of Mr. Soros.  While investigators initially thought that some devices were hand delivered, they now believe it is likely all of them were sent in the mail.  Using information collected by the United States Postal Service, investigators have focused their attention on certain Florida postal centers, including one in Opa-locka near Miami.

TITLE: President Wants to Use Executive Order to End Birthright Citizenship

PUBLISHED: 2018/10/30

President Trump said he was preparing an executive order that would nullify the long-accepted constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship in the United States, his latest attention-grabbing maneuver days before midterm congressional elections as he has sought to activate his base by vowing to clamp down on immigrants and immigration.
 â€œWeâ€™re the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years, with all of those benefits,â€\\x9d Mr. Trump told Axios during an interview that was released in part on Tuesday, making a false claim. â€œItâ€™s ridiculous. Itâ€™s ridiculous. And it has to end.â€\\x9d
 In fact, at least 30 other countries, including Canada, Mexico and many others in the Western Hemisphere, grant automatic birthright citizenship, according to a study by the Center for Immigration Studies, an organization that supports restricting immigration and whose work Mr. Trumpâ€™s advisers often cite.
 But Mr. Trumpâ€™s plan met with swift pushback from some even in his own party on Tuesday. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who is retiring, said in an interview that the president â€œobviouslyâ€\\x9d cannot eviscerate birthright citizenship by executive order.
 â€œYou obviously cannot do that,â€\\x9d Ryan told WVLK, a radio station in Lexington, Ky. â€œIâ€™m a believer in following the plain text of the Constitution, and I think in this case, the 14th Amendment is pretty clear, and that would involve a very, very lengthy constitutional process.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Ryan compared the idea of doing so to Barack Obamaâ€™s 2012 action to grant work permits and deportation reprieves to some undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, which Republicans, including Mr. Trump, vociferously protested as a naked abuse of presidential power.
 Doing away with birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants was an idea Mr. Trump pitched as a presidential candidate, but there is no clear indication that he would be able to do so unilaterally, and attempting to would be certain to prompt legal challenges. The consensus among legal scholars is that he cannot, but Mr. Trump and his allies are eager to test it in the Supreme Court.
 â€œWe all cherish the language of the 14th Amendment, but the Supreme Court of the United States has never ruled on whether the language of the 14th Amendment â€” â€™subject to the jurisdiction thereofâ€™ â€” applies specifically to people who are in the country illegally,â€\\x9d Vice President Mike Pence told Politico in an interview on Tuesday, several hours after Mr. Trumpâ€™s comments were reported.
 It is likewise unknown how serious Mr. Trump is about taking the action. In recent days, with the approach of the midterm balloting in which Republican control of Congress is at risk, he has sought to appeal to voters by making other dramatic claims that appear to have no chance of materializing, such as imminent action to grant a 10 percent tax cut for the middle class.
 To accomplish the idea he floated on Tuesday, Mr. Trump would have to find a way around the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which states, â€œAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.â€\\x9d
 The amendment means that any child born in the United States is considered a citizen. Amendments to the Constitution cannot be overridden by presidential action â€” they can be changed or undone only by overwhelming majorities in Congress or the states, with a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress or through a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of state legislatures.
 Some conservatives have long made the argument that the 14th Amendment was meant to apply only to citizens and legal permanent residents, not immigrants who are present in the country without authorization. In an opinion piece in The Washington Post this year, Michael Anton, a former spokesman for Mr. Trumpâ€™s National Security Council, said birthright citizenship was based on a misreading of the amendment, and of an 1898 Supreme Court ruling that he argued pertained only to the children of legal residents.
 â€œThe notion that simply being born within the geographical limits of the United States automatically confers U.S. citizenship is an absurdity â€” historically, constitutionally, philosophically and practically,â€\\x9d Mr. Anton wrote in July. â€œAn executive order could specify to federal agencies that the children of noncitizens are not citizens.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Trump told Axios that while he initially believed he needed a constitutional amendment or action by Congress to make the change, the White House Counselâ€™s Office has advised him otherwise.
 â€œNow theyâ€™re saying I can do it just with an executive order,â€\\x9d Mr. Trump said. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for clarification of the legal grounds the presidentâ€™s lawyers have given him for validating such a move.
 His discussion of the idea comes after the administration announced it was streaming more than 5,000 active-duty troops to the southern border, part of an election-season rash of executive action Mr. Trump has undertaken as he works to energize his anti-immigrant base.
 It also follows action by the Trump administration to try to discourage legal immigrants from using public benefits through a new federal rule that would deny green card status to people who use social safety net services, like food assistance and Medicaid.
 The proposal provoked outrage among civil rights groups, a response that Mr. Trumpâ€™s advisers have argued privately is a central objective of many of the presidentâ€™s most aggressive proposals on immigration and other matters.
 Jess Morales Rocketto, the chairwoman of Families Belong Together, an immigrant advocacy group, called the idea â€œethnic cleansing.â€\\x9d
 Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyersâ€™ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, called the idea illegal and offensive.
 â€œAside from being unconstitutional, such an executive order would exacerbate racial tensions, exploit fears and drive further polarization across the country at a moment that calls for the promotion of unity and inclusion,â€\\x9d Ms. Clarke said in a statement. â€œThe letter and spirit of the Fourteenth Amendment places those born in this country on equal footing, and an executive order that strips away citizenship would create a permanent group of second-class citizens and invite litigation.â€\\x9d
 Some Republicans also rejected Mr. Trumpâ€™s suggestion, an indication of the political risks for the party that attend the presidentâ€™s bid to stoke anti-immigrant sentiment in advance of next Tuesdayâ€™s voting.
 â€œThe President is wrong to end #BirthrightCitizenship,â€\\x9d Bob Hugin, a Republican candidate for Senate in New Jersey, said in a Twitter post. â€œWeâ€™re a nation of immigrants made better by the diversity of its people, especially in NJ. We need compassionate comprehensive immigration reform now.â€\\x9d
 A 1898 Supreme Court decision held that Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco to Chinese parents residing in the United States, was a citizen because of his birth on American soil. Mr. Anton argued in The Post that because his parents were legal residents, the ruling should not be read as an affirmation of the status of children of undocumented immigrants.
 But immigration advocates argue that scrapping the concept of birthright citizenship would do away with a vital principle, and would be counterproductive to the stated goals of those who, like Mr. Trump, rail routinely against illegal immigration. According to a study by the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan group, if citizenship were denied to every child with at least one unauthorized parent, the unauthorized population in the United States would reach 24 million by 2050 â€” more than double what it is now.
 Stephen Legomsky, a Washington University School of Law professor and former chief counsel for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said the 14th Amendmentâ€™s application to the children of undocumented immigrants was a matter of pure common sense.
 â€œLike anyone else, native-born Americans, whoever their parents are, can be charged with crimes if they disobey U.S. law,â€\\x9d Mr. Legomsky said. â€œHow would this be possible if the U.S. had no jurisdiction over them?â€\\x9d

Texas Congressman Who Settled Harassment Case With Taxpayer Funds Resigns

 WASHINGTON â€” Representative Blake Farenthold, the Texas Republican who used $84,000 in taxpayer funds to settle a sexual harassment case with his former communications director, abruptly resigned from Congress on Friday afternoon.
 In December, Mr. Farenthold, who represented the 27th District of Texas, said that he would not run for re-election amid scrutiny over the payment and accusations from other aides that he set the tone for a hostile work environment in his office. At the time, he was one of several lawmakers to announce his eventual departure from Congress after being accused of sexual harassment and discrimination.
 â€œWhile I planned on serving out the remainder of my term in Congress, I know in my heart itâ€™s time for me to move along and look for new ways to serve,â€\\x9d Mr. Farenthold said in a statement on Friday, thanking his staff, his family and the voters who elected him.
 It was known for several years that Mr. Farenthold, already notorious for a heavily circulated photograph of him in duck pajamas, had been accused of sexual harassment by Lauren Greene, his former communications director. She sued him in 2014, claiming that he had illegally fired her after she complained about mistreatment.
 But in December, the extent of Mr. Farentholdâ€™s settlement was revealed when Congressâ€™s Office of Compliance released details of six settlements that it had paid out since 2013 as part of a review of discrimination and sexual harassment in congressional offices. His case was the only settlement involving sexual harassment since 2013.
 â€œWhile I 100 percent support more transparency with respect to claims against members of Congress, I can neither confirm nor deny that settlement involved my office,â€\\x9d Mr. Farenthold said at the time.
 A decision in 2015 by the Office of Congressional Ethics, an independent, nonpartisan board, cleared him of wrongdoing, and he promised to repay the settlement.
 A spokeswoman for Mr. Farenthold did not respond to questions about whether he had fulfilled that promise or whether he would do so after resigning. But fellow Republicans suggested that he had not.
 â€œMr. Farenthold made a commitment that he would reimburse taxpayers for the settlement,â€\\x9d said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Speaker Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin. â€œHe reiterated his commitment to the speaker, and the speaker expects him to follow through.â€\\x9d
 Representative Steve Stivers, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, also said in a statement that he hoped Mr. Farenthold would be â€œtrue to his wordâ€\\x9d and pay back the taxpayer money.
 After the disclosure, more of his aides came forward to accuse Mr. Farenthold of fostering a hostile environment, describing a congressman with a harsh temper who made sexually explicit jokes and engaged in casual sexual banter.
 The House Ethics Committee also opened a subcommittee investigation into Ms. Greeneâ€™s allegations.
 In a video in December announcing his resignation, Mr. Farenthold continued to deny the allegations, but he acknowledged running an â€œunprofessionalâ€\\x9d workplace and said he was â€œprofoundly sorryâ€\\x9d for his actions. At the time, Republican leadership praised his decision to step aside, over Democratic criticism that he should immediately resign.
 After his resignation on Friday, Mr. Farenthold deleted his Twitter account and the Facebook campaign page where he first announced his decision to not seek re-election.
 â€œLeaving my service in the House,â€\\x9d he said in his statement, â€œIâ€™m able to look back at the entirety of my career in public office and say that it was well worthwhile.â€\\x9d

Texas Rep. Blake Farenthold resigns from Congress
 U.S. Representative Blake Farenthold resigned from Congress on Friday, following multiple allegations of sexual harassment, misconduct and inappropriate behavior.
 Farenthold, R-Texas, had previously announced that he would not seek re-election in the 2018 midterm election, when reports of sexual misconduct first surfaced.
 â€œWhile I planned on serving out the remainder of my term in Congress, I know in my heart itâ€™s time for me to move along and look for new ways to serve,â€\\x9d Farenthold said in a statement Friday evening, noting he sent a letter to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to tell him about his resignation, effective at 5 p.m.
 â€œItâ€™s been an honor and privilege to serve the constituents of Texasâ€™ 27th Congressional District. I would like to thank my staff both in Washington and Texas for all of their hard work on behalf of our constituents. I would also like to thank my family for their unwavering support and most importantly the people that elected me,â€\\x9d Farenthold said. â€œLeaving my service in the House, Iâ€™m able to look back at the entirety of my career in public office and say that it was well worthwhile.â€\\x9d
 Farenthold was sued by his former aide, Lauren Greene, in 2014, alleging a hostile work environment, gender discrimination and retaliation. Among other things, Greene claimed Farenthold asked her for a threesome. She sued him and was paid $84,000 from a public fund on behalf of Farenthold for a sexual harassment claim.
 Farenthold pledged to repay the $84,000 in taxpayer money spent to settle the claim.
 Farentholdâ€™s former communications director, Michael Rekola, also described in detail the congressmanâ€™s alleged abusive behavior toward staff members, which ranged from making sexually graphic jokes to verbally abusing his aides.
 Other staffers accused Farenthold of routinely commenting on the size of womenâ€™s breasts and making jokes about being on â€œredhead patrolâ€\\x9d because he was attracted to women with red hair.

TITLE: 'Jail!' Trump slams 'crooked' Hillary aide Huma, calls on 'Deep State' DOJ to act

'Jail!' Trump slams 'crooked' Hillary aide Huma, calls on 'Deep State' DOJ to act
 President Trump went after "Crooked" Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin on Tuesday, appearing to call on the â€œDeep Stateâ€\\x9d Justice Department to look at potential security issues in her handling of classified material after a recent email dump.
 â€œCrooked Hillary Clintonâ€™s top aide, Huma Abedin, has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols. She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Remember sailors pictures on the submarine? Jail!â€\\x9d Trump tweeted early Tuesday. â€œDeep State Justice Dept must finally act? Also on Comey & others.â€\\x9d
 Trump was referring to U.S. Navy Sailor Kristian Saucier, who was put in prison for taking unauthorized photos inside a nuclear submarine. He seemed to suggest a double standard is at play, compared with the lack of punishment for Clinton and her aides.
 The presidentâ€™s tweet comes after the State Department, in a Friday news dump, released a batch of emails from Abedinâ€™s account that were discovered by the FBI on a laptop belonging to her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner. At least four of the documents were marked â€œclassified.â€\\x9d
 Abedin also forwarded sensitive State Department emails to her personal Yahoo email account before every Yahoo account was hacked, first reported by the Daily Caller. Abedin also sent passwords for her government laptop to her Yahoo account on Aug. 24, 2009.
 In 2013, Yahoo was hacked, and the company said in a statement that â€œall Yahoo user accounts were affectedâ€\\x9d by the theft.
 Former FBI Director James Comey, who led the Clinton email investigation, said during a congressional hearing last year that he believed Abedin forwarded emails to Weiner for him to print out so that she could give them to Clinton.
 Abedinâ€™s emails shook the 2016 presidential race, as Comey told Congress on Oct. 28, 2016, just days before the election, that the FBI had found more of Clintonâ€™s messages on Weinerâ€™s laptop as they investigated a sexting case against him.
 The discovery of those records reopened the case against Clinton, several months after Comey said he wasnâ€™t recommending any charges be filed in the case. Comey at the time said Clinton was â€œextremely carelessâ€\\x9d in her handling of classified emails on her private server.

TITLE: GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter, Wife Indicted On Campaign Finance Fraud Charges

PUBLISHED: 2018/08/21

U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) and his wife, Margaret Hunter, were indicted Tuesday on charges of improperly using campaign funds for private use.
 A grand jury in San Diego indicted the Hunters on charges of filing false campaign finance records, saying the couple misused more than $250,000 after a two-year investigation. The Justice Department said the pair used political money to pay for their childrenâ€™s tuition and spent thousands of dollars at shopping malls, Washington restaurants and surf shops, among other expenditures.
 The indictment includes details accusing the Hunters of making efforts to hide their personal expenses, including labeling fees for dental work as a donation to a charity called â€œSmiles for Lifeâ€\\x9d and tickets to see Riverdance as a fundraising event for â€œRepublican women.â€\\x9d
 Hunter, 41, is a five-term congressman representing San Diego County who served for three tours in Afghanistan and Iraq as a Marine. His family has been a household name in California politics for decades, and his father, also named Duncan Hunter, served in the U.S. House for nearly 30 years until handing the reins to his son.
 Hunter had blamed his wife, who acted as a campaign manager, for many of the improper charges, saying she controlled the campaignâ€™s credit card, and in February he feigned ignorance in an interview with Politico, saying: â€œNah, I know the rules.â€\\x9d
 â€œAnd if I didâ€\\x9d spend campaign funds improperly, he said, â€œit was an accident and I paid it back.â€\\x9d
 He repaid his campaign more than $60,000 earlier this year for improper expenses dating back to 2015, but the FBI began investigation additional charges dating back as far as 2009, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune.
 â€œThe goal of the conspiracy was for Duncan Hunter and Margaret Hunter to enrich themselves, and others at their direction, by converting campaign funds for their own personal benefit and enjoyment,â€\\x9d the 47-page indictment says. â€œThe Hunters knew that many of their desired purchases could be made only by using campaign funds, since they did not otherwise have sufficient personal funds to pay for their purchases.â€\\x9d
 In a speech earlier this month, Hunter echoed President Donald Trump and castigated the Justice Department, accusing the agency of being â€œcorrupt, answerable to no oneâ€\\x9d and said it â€œuses the law to extort the American people and effect political change.â€\\x9d
 â€œI call on this Congress to root out all the corrupt lawyers and bureaucrats in the DOJ and the FBI so the greatest president of my generation can do the work that the American people duly elected him to do,â€\\x9d Hunter said.
 The lawmaker is running for re-election in November against Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar.
 When HuffPost asked Hunter how his campaign was going at the end of July, just before House lawmakers left for the August break, Hunter said things were good.
 â€œI donâ€™t think thereâ€™s a big wave right now,â€\\x9d Hunter said, referring to a wave of Democratic gains. He said polling had him safely above his opponent â€” â€œWeâ€™re looking goodâ€\\x9d â€” and he indicated he wasnâ€™t really afraid of losing.
 â€œThe Republicans left in California are pretty well-liked by their constituents,â€\\x9d he said.

TITLE: Jim Mattis, Defense Secretary, Resigns in Rebuke of Trumpâ€™s Worldview

PUBLISHED: 2018/12/20

WASHINGTON â€” Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, whose experience and stability were widely seen as a balance to an unpredictable president, resigned Thursday in protest of President Trumpâ€™s decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances.
 Mr. Mattis had repeatedly told friends and aides over recent months that he viewed his responsibility to protect the United Statesâ€™ 1.3 million active-duty troops as worth the concessions necessary as defense secretary to a mercurial president. But on Thursday, in an extraordinary rebuke of the president, he decided that Mr. Trumpâ€™s decision to withdraw roughly 2,000 American troops from Syria was a step too far.
 Officials said Mr. Mattis went to the White House with his resignation letter already written, but nonetheless made a last attempt at persuading the president to reverse his decision about Syria, which Mr. Trump announced on Wednesday over the objections of his senior advisers.
 Mr. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, was rebuffed. Returning to the Pentagon, he asked aides to print out 50 copies of his resignation letter and distribute them around the building.
 â€œMy views on treating allies with respect and also being cleareyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held,â€\\x9d Mr. Mattis wrote. â€œBecause you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.â€\\x9d
 His resignation came as Congress appeared to be hurtling toward a government shutdown and as a deep market slump became even worse over fears of continuing government turmoil.
 With the ousting this month of John F. Kelly as White House chief of staff, Mr. Mattis was the last of Mr. Trumpâ€™s old-guard national security team â€” leaving policy in the hands of Mike Pompeo, the presidentâ€™s second secretary of state, and John R. Bolton, the third White House national security adviser.
 Mr. Trump said that Mr. Mattis, 68, will leave at the end of February, and that Mr. Mattis â€œwas a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations.â€\\x9d
 The president said he would name a replacement soon.
 As Mr. Mattis was handing in his resignation, the Pentagon was preparing to draw down forces in Afghanistan. Two Defense Department officials said Thursday that about 7,000 troops will be withdrawn in the coming months â€” cutting in half the number of American forces there â€” in an early step to ending the United Statesâ€™ involvement in the 17-year war.
 â€œThis is scary,â€\\x9d Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a Twitter post. He called Mr. Mattis â€œan island of stability amidst the chaos of the Trump administration.â€\\x9d
 Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, called it â€œa sad day for America because Secretary Mattis was giving advice the President needs to hear.â€\\x9d
 He added that Mr. Mattis â€œrightly believes that Russia and China are clear adversaries and that we are at war with jihadists across the globe who plot to kill Americans at home.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Mattisâ€™s resignation letter was the sharpest, and most public, protest from inside the Trump administration over the presidentâ€™s rejection of the alliances and relationships that have underpinned American security since the end of World War II.
 It was also the first resignation over a major national security issue by a leading cabinet member since 1980, when Cyrus Vance quit as secretary of state. Mr. Vance left over President Jimmy Carterâ€™s decision to attempt a rescue effort for American hostages in Iran that Mr. Vance considered ill-advised and that ended in tragedy.
 Mr. Mattisâ€™s letter did not single out any decision. Instead, it condemned Mr. Trumpâ€™s approach to the world as destructive to American influence and power.
 He said the core of American national interests lay in â€œproviding effective leadership to our alliances,â€\\x9d and specifically described the importance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a defense alliance Mr. Trump has often derided. Mr. Mattis also praised the â€œDefeat ISISâ€\\x9d coalition that Mr. Trump just abandoned in Syria.
 But Mr. Mattisâ€™s core complaint was that Mr. Trump had lost sight of the importance of the competition for global power with Russia and China, who want â€œa world consistent with their authoritarian model.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Mattis was the primary author of a new American defense strategy whose central goal was to take on â€œrevisionistâ€\\x9d powers â€” an approach that some of Mr. Trumpâ€™s former advisers say the president never fully comprehended.
 Mr. Trumpâ€™s decision to pull out of Syria, which was opposed by virtually every high-level administration official but lauded by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, was the last straw. Among his other concerns, Mr. Mattis viewed the withdrawal as abandoning Kurdish fighters and other American allies, and as ceding critical territory to Russia and Iran.
 No senior Pentagon official has defended the withdrawal publicly, despite requests from the White House. As a result, Mr. Trump appeared by himself in a video â€” which he tweeted Wednesday evening â€” announcing victory over the Islamic State.
 During Thursdayâ€™s meeting at the White House, officials said that Mr. Trump again asked Mr. Mattis to publicly endorse the Syria decision. Mr. Mattis refused.
 The presidentâ€™s tweets announcing the departure of his defense secretary shocked officials at the Pentagon, who as recently as Thursday afternoon were insisting that Mr. Mattis had no intention of resigning.
 Mr. Trumpâ€™s selection of Mr. Mattis as his Pentagon chief only weeks after his 2016 election was widely praised. The career Marine was respected among allies and adversaries and on Capitol Hill, and he was beloved in the Pentagon as a protector against a president with scant understanding of his own role as commander in chief.
 Mr. Mattis commanded Marines in Afghanistan and in the 2003 invasion of Iraq before becoming the head of United States Central Command, overseeing all American troops in the Middle East. Though a colorful, hard-charging advocate of aggressive offensive action, Mr. Mattis viewed a tough American posture overseas as a way to deter war, not to start them, with potential foes like Iran.
 He favored working with allies, and often spoke of how difficult it was to conduct American policy without the benefit of friends. During his job interview with Mr. Trump in 2016, Mr. Mattis said he did not believe in torturing terrorism suspects to get information because he thought he could get more out of detainees by talking to them over a pack of cigarettes and a beer.
 The relationship between Mr. Mattis and Mr. Trump had deteriorated for months. The widely accepted narrative that Mr. Mattis was the adult in the room when at the White House came to annoy the president. In October, Mr. Trump accused Mr. Mattis of being a Democrat â€” a charge akin to treason in the current Republican administration.
 As defense secretary, Mr. Mattis oversaw the worldâ€™s most powerful military, supervising active-duty troops based in the United States and deployed worldwide, including in war zones in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and on the Saudi border with Yemen. There are also around 25,000 American troops in South Korea, where they have served for generations as a deterrent against North Korea.
 As with Mr. Trumpâ€™s abrupt firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the split with Mr. Mattis was a full turn in a relationship that once appeared strong.
 In Mr. Mattisâ€™s early days as defense secretary, he often ate dinner with the president in the White House residence. Over hamburgers, and with the help of briefing folders, Mr. Mattis explained to Mr. Trump key points about the United Statesâ€™ relationships with allies.
 But Mr. Mattis also quietly slow-walked a number of Mr. Trumpâ€™s proposals, including banning transgender troops, starting  a Space Force and putting on a costly military parade. In each case, he went through the motions of acquiescing to the White House â€” and then buried the plans in Defense Department red tape.

Schumer bashed by the left over shutdown-ending deal
 Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is taking heat from some of the most influential and deep-pocketed groups in the liberal base for caving to Republicans in the shutdown standoff.
 â€œTodayâ€™s cave by most Senate Democrats was â€¦ a stunning display of moral and political cowardice," said Democracy for America, just one of several such groups bashing Schumer for the stand-down on Monday. â€œMost Senate Democrats, including Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, voted to allow Donald Trump to continue to subject an ever-growing number of Dreamers to lives threatened by deportation from the only home theyâ€™ve ever known.â€\\x9d
 Schumer and fellow Senate Democrats forced the shutdown over the weekend after insisting that any temporary spending bill to keep the government fully operational include permanent protections for the so-called DREAMers -- immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children.
 The four-term New York senator and the dozens of other Democrats who initially voted Friday to block the spending bill had been lauded by their progressive base even as nearly 1 million federal workers were furloughed without pay.
 â€œLet the Senate know we stand with them for the Dreamers â€¦ say THANKS! to @SenSchumer and your own senator, and to urge them to stay strong,â€\\x9d tweeted the Brooklyn, N.Y., chapter of Indivisible Nation, a leader in the progressive, Resist Trump movement.
 Yet by the time Schumer said Monday afternoon on the Senate floor that Democrats would soon vote in support of ending the shutdown, in exchange for Republicansâ€™ commitment to promptly craft and vote on legislation to help DREAMers, Schumerâ€™s support had turned. He suddenly faced calls to rally outside his Brooklyn apartment and suggestions that his leadership position was no longer secure.
 â€œThis deal was morally reprehensible and political malpractice. Itâ€™s Senator Schumerâ€™s job to keep the caucus together and fight for progressive values. He failed in that today,â€\\x9d said Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin. â€œThe big blue wave that Schumer hopes will make him Senate majority leader in 2019 will not build itself.â€\\x9d
 Democracy for America, the political action committee founded by former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean, also said: "If you want to know why we lost in 2016 and why a Democratic wave in 2018 is far from guaranteed â€¦ look no further than this weak and profoundly disappointing cave from Senate Democrats.â€\\x9d
 Members of the â€œNo, DREAM, No Dealâ€\\x9d began stepping up their calls for Schumer and others to â€œstand strongâ€\\x9d Sunday night, when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., suggested a compromise had been reached, without offering any solid commitment.
 â€œWhen the Democrat filibuster of the government funding bill ends, the serious, bipartisan negotiations that have been going on for months now to resolve our unfinished business -- military spending; disaster relief; healthcare; immigration and border security -- will continue,â€\\x9d he said. â€œAssuming that the government remains open, it would be my intention to proceed to legislation that would address DACA.â€\\x9d
 Schumer, near the time of his announcement Monday, pledged his continued support for DREAMers, tweeting: â€œSoon, the govt will reopen, and we have a lot to do: #ProtectDreamers. Write a budget, Address health care, veterans, disaster relief, pensions & the opioid epidemic. The #TrumpShutdown will soon end, but the work goes on.â€\\x9d
 But by the time Republicans had the 60-plus votes, with support from 33 Democrats, the revolt was in full force.
 â€œEnough is enough,â€\\x9d said Lorella Praeli, director of immigration policy and campaigns at the American Civil Liberties Union. â€œWe cannot rely on empty promises from those who have already proven to play politics with the lives of Dreamers. â€¦ Let it be known -- we will be watching, and will make sure voters this November know if their representatives stood for Dreamers or for their deportations.â€\\x9d
 The short-term deal now only gives Congress until Feb. 8 to work out longer-term legislation, and an agreement on immigration.
 Trump tweeted Tuesday he's not sure it will happen.
 "Nobody knows for sure that the Republicans & Democrats will be able to reach a deal on DACA by February 8, but everyone will be trying....with a big additional focus put on Military Strength and Border Security. The Dems have just learned that a Shutdown is not the answer!" he said.

GOP Rep. Blake Farenthold Resigns After Sexual Harassment Allegations
 Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) is resigning from Congress, he announced Friday in a statement and accompanying video.
 Farenthold declared in December that he would not seek re-election in 2018 after reports emerged that heâ€™d used taxpayer money to settle sexual harassment claims. A few of his GOP colleagues urged him to resign over the accusations, which Farenthold has repeatedly denied.
 â€œWhile I planned on serving out the remainder of my term in Congress, I know in my heart itâ€™s time for me to move along and look for new ways to serve,â€\\x9d he said in the statement.
 In his video, flanked by an American flag and a Texas state flag, he added: â€œYou know, I look forward to staying in touch with everyone. Itâ€™s been an honor and a privilege to serve. Thank you so much. Please, stay in touch. I love yâ€™all. God bless you, God bless Texas, God bless America.â€\\x9d
 Farentholdâ€™s resignation took effect Friday at 5 p.m. Eastern time. He promptly deleted his Twitter and Facebook profiles.
 Farenthold used $84,000 in taxpayer funds to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit his former communications director, Lauren Greene, had filed in 2014, Politico reported in December. Greene accused Farenthold of telling her he had â€œsexual fantasiesâ€\\x9d and â€œwet dreamsâ€\\x9d about her, and then claimed she was fired after complaining to Farenthold.
 â€œI had no idea how to run a congressional office,â€\\x9d the four-term congressman said in December. â€œAs a result, I allowed a workplace culture to take root in my office that was too permissive and decidedly unprofessional.â€\\x9d
 Farenthold said after the reports broke that he would repay the $84,000 to the Treasury Department, but has not made good on that promise. A representative for his office told HuffPost in February that the congressman was waiting to see what changes lawmakers will add to the Congressional Accountability Act.
 â€œHe is waiting on the advice of counsel to see what final bill is enacted,â€\\x9d Bob Haueter, Farentholdâ€™s chief of staff, told HuffPost at the time. â€œOnce the final bill is done and the law is changed and is complete and he can see that, he will make a determination of how he proceeds.â€\\x9d
 In his resignation statement, Farenthold reflected on his time spent working to â€œmake government more efficient and responsive, cut government spending, repeal Obamacare, protect life and reduce the debt.â€\\x9d
 â€œI would like to thank my staff both in Washington and Texas for all of their hard work on behalf of our constituents. I would also like to thank my family for their unwavering support and most importantly the people that elected me,â€\\x9d he said.

TITLE: FBI Agent Peter Strzok Fired Over Anti-Trump Text Messages

PUBLISHED: 2018/08/13

WASHINGTON â€• FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who was taken off special counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s team after Justice Department investigators discovered his texts disparaging President Donald Trump, has been fired from the bureau despite the recommendations of a career FBI official.
 Aitan Goelman, Strzokâ€™s attorney, said in a statement that Strzok was fired late Friday afternoon on the orders of FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich, despite an FBI career officialâ€™s recommendation that Strzok face a 60-day suspension and a demotion.
 Goelman called the decision â€œa departure from typical Bureau practiceâ€\\x9d and said it contradicted FBI Director Chris Wrayâ€™s earlier guarantee that the bureau would follow its regular process, despite Trumpâ€™s disdain for the now-former FBI official.
 â€œThis decision should be deeply troubling to all Americans. A lengthy investigation and multiple rounds of Congressional testimony failed to produce a shred of evidence that Special Agent Strzokâ€™s personal views ever affected his work,â€\\x9d Goelman said. â€œIn fact, in his decades of service, Special Agent Strzok has proved himself to be one of the countryâ€™s top counterintelligence officers, leading to only one conclusion â€• the decision to terminate was taken in response to political pressure, and to punish Special Agent Strzok for political speech protected by the First Amendment, not on a fair and independent examination of the facts. It is a decision that produces only one winner â€• those who seek to harm our country and weaken our democracy.â€\\x9d
 Strzok exchanged texts with former FBI official Lisa Page that disparaged Trump as well as other politicians, including various Democrats. He testified last month after the release of an inspector general report on the handling of the FBIâ€™s Hillary Clinton probe that described anti-Trump texts exchanged by bureau officials.
 Strzok, a 21-year veteran of the FBI, played a prominent role in both of the investigations surrounding the Clinton and Trump campaigns during the 2016 election. He was involved in the Clinton investigation, which was highly public, as well as the investigation into the Trump campaign and Russian interference in the 2016 election, which the bureau never publicly acknowledged until months into Trumpâ€™s presidency. Strzok subsequently joined the Mueller team, but left the team as soon as Mueller became aware of his anti-Trump texts.
 The precise justification for Bowdichâ€™s decision to fire Strzok despite the recommendation of the FBIâ€™s Office of Professional Responsibility is unclear. But DOJâ€™s inspector general was â€œdeeply troubledâ€\\x9d by texts Strzok sent that â€œpotentially indicated or created the appearance that the investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations,â€\\x9d and particularly focused on one anti-Trump text that implied a willingness â€œto take official action to impact the presidential candidateâ€™s electoral prospects.â€\\x9d The inspector general report also criticized Strzok for his use of personal email to conduct FBI business.
 Itâ€™s possible that the former FBI counterintelligence officialâ€™s extramarital relationship with Page also played a role in the FBIâ€™s decision. Wray said at at a press conference in June that the bureau wouldnâ€™t â€œhesitate to hold people accountable for their actionsâ€\\x9d after the disciplinary process.
 Trump celebrated Strzokâ€™s firing on Twitter, writing Monday that the investigation into his campaign â€œshould be droppedâ€\\x9d and that the investigation into Clinton â€œshould be properly redone.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Democrats urge Trump to cancel Putin summit, after indictment of Russian intel officers

Democrats urge Trump to cancel Putin summit, after indictment of Russian intel officers
 Top Democrats on Friday swiftly pressured President Trump to consider cancelling his upcoming summit with Vladimir Putin, after a dozen Russian intelligence officers were indicted for allegedly hacking party emails in 2016.
 Sen. Mark Warner, top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, offered Trump an ultimatum for the highly anticipated summit: make Russian interference a priority, or cancel the meeting.
 Other Democrats said Trump should nix the summit regardless -- though they were raising concerns about the meeting even before the indictment.
 Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the charges during a Friday press conference. According to the DOJ document, 12 Russian intelligence officers are accused of hacking emails from the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic Party during the 2016 election.
 â€œI want to make sure that other Americans hear ... the president make this issue of Russian interference a priority in the meeting,â€\\x9d Warner, D-Va., told reporters on Capitol Hill Friday. â€œIf they donâ€™t make the indictments a priority in the meeting in Helsinki, then the summit should be canceled.â€\\x9d
 Warner, whose committee has been investigating Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in the 2016 election for more than a year, also stressed that there â€œneeds to be other Americans in the roomâ€\\x9d in Helsinki, Finland Monday to ensure that Trump makes the issue of interference in the 2016 election a â€œpriority.â€\\x9d
 â€œThere should be no one-on-one meeting between this president and Putin,â€\\x9d Warner said. â€œThere needs to be other Americans in the room, or the summit should be canceled.â€\\x9d
 He warned, â€œIâ€™m afraid the president could be taken advantage of.â€\\x9d
 But as Trump continues to describe the Russia probe as a "witch hunt," the White House downplayed the latest allegations.
 â€œTodayâ€™s charges include no allegations of knowing involvement by anyone on the campaign and no allegations that the alleged hacking affected the election result,â€\\x9d said Lindsay Walters, the deputy White House press secretary. â€œThis is consistent with what we have been saying all along.â€\\x9d
 Within minutes of the indictment, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., urged Trump to call off the Putin meeting.
 â€œCancel the Putin meeting. Now,â€\\x9d Schumer tweeted Friday.
 Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said a handshake with Putin would be "a moment of historic cowardice."
 "In light of what's been revealed about Russiaâ€™s attack on our democracy, the president shaking Putin's hand would be a moment of historic cowardice. Call off this summit, @realDonaldTrump," Wyden tweeted.
 Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said Trump should â€œimmediately cancel his meeting.â€\\x9d
 House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said â€œthe stakesâ€\\x9d for the summit â€œcould not be higher.â€\\x9d
 â€œPresident Trump must demand and secure a real, concrete and comprehensive agreement that the Russians will cease their ongoing attacks on our democracy,â€\\x9d Pelosi said in a statement Friday. â€œFailure to stand up to Putin would constitute a profound betrayal of the Constitution and our democracy.â€\\x9d
 Presuming the meeting takes place as scheduled, Helsinki will be the final stop on Trumpâ€™s four-nation European tour.
 Trump spent the past week meeting with NATO allies in Brussels; meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May and Queen Elizabeth II in England; and visiting Scotland.

TITLE: Donald Trump Vows To End Birthright Citizenship

PUBLISHED: 2018/10/30

President Donald Trump said heâ€™s considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to parents who arenâ€™t citizens â€• a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment that could likely be changed only through a constitutional amendment.
 Trump said in an interview with â€œAxios on HBOâ€\\x9d taped Monday that he could execute the change via executive order.
 â€œIt was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment. Guess what? You donâ€™t,â€\\x9d Trump said. â€œYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress. But now theyâ€™re saying I can do it just with an executive order.â€\\x9d
 He said the right awarded to babies born as birthright Americans is â€œridiculousâ€\\x9d and that the system â€œhas to end.â€\\x9d
 Trump also falsely stated that the U.S. is â€œthe only country in the worldâ€\\x9d that offers citizenship to those born here. More than 30 nations, including Canada and Mexico, have similar policies.
 Itâ€™s not clear what the executive order would look like or when it would be proposed â€• if Trump follows through at all, considering his tendency for pre-election bluster and warnings he has received from fellow Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.), who have said doing so would be outside the bounds the presidentâ€™s authority.
 All babies born in the U.S. are American citizens under the Constitutionâ€™s 14th Amendment, which cannot be changed by presidential order.
 Changing that policy would dramatically reshape the U.S. â€• effectively punishing the children of undocumented immigrants, whom Trump has vowed to remove from the country. Even if he doesnâ€™t follow through or succeed, though, Trumpâ€™s vow to try aligns with other messaging and actions attacking undocumented immigrants ahead of the midterm elections next Tuesday.
 An executive order challenging birthright citizenship would ensure a legal battle, in which most experts think the president would fail. The Supreme Court ruled in 1898â€™s U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark that a child born in the U.S. to immigrant parents was a citizen under the 14th Amendment.
 â€œThe president cannot erase the Constitution with an executive order, and the 14th Amendmentâ€™s citizenship guarantee is clear,â€\\x9d said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLUâ€™s Immigrantsâ€™ Rights Project. â€œThis is a transparent and blatantly unconstitutional attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred in the days ahead of the midterms.â€\\x9d
 Some Republicans â€• including Ryan â€• quickly shot down Trumpâ€™s idea. â€œYou cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order,â€\\x9d the House speaker said Tuesday on WVLK Radio, according to Bloomberg News reporter Erik Wasson.
 Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) criticized the presidentâ€™s statement, calling instead for immigration reform â€œthat makes our country more secure and reaffirms our wonderful tradition as a nation of immigrants.â€\\x9d
 Another Republican, Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, also tweeted that such an executive order would not be possible.
 The are some experts who disagree. Axios cited John Eastman, a constitutional law professor at Chapman University and director of The Claremont Instituteâ€™s Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence, who said the amendment has been misapplied and was not intended to apply to every person born in the U.S. regardless of parentage.
 Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) announced Tuesday that he would introduce legislation â€œalong the same lines as the proposed executive order from President Trumpâ€\\x9d to end birthright citizenship, a policy change he has supported for years. Itâ€™s unclear what his legislation would look like â€• and he has previously suggested such a change would require a constitutional amendment.
 â€œThis policy is a magnet for illegal immigration, out of the mainstream of the developed world, and needs to come to an end,â€\\x9d Graham said in a statement on Tuesday.
 Trump has long supported ending birthright citizenship, recommending in 2015 on the campaign trail that the country â€œstart a processâ€\\x9d to scrap it.
 â€œI donâ€™t think they have American citizenship and if you speak to some very, very good lawyers â€” and I know some will disagree â€” but many of them agree with me and youâ€™re going to find they do not have American citizenship. Our country is going to hell,â€\\x9d Trump said then in an interview with CNN.
 The president has lasered in on immigration ahead of next weekâ€™s midterm elections, stoking fear about the caravan of migrants heading toward the U.S.-Mexico border from Central America. He has falsely claimed the caravan is stocked with criminals, gang members and Middle Eastern terrorists, and has threatened to cut off aid to Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, the countries where most of the migrants hail from.
 He deployed 5,200 active-duty troops to the border on Monday in what officials of his administration described as a necessary national security measure.

TITLE: Mueller Disputes BuzzFeed Report That Trump Told Michael Cohen To Lie To Congress

PUBLISHED: 2019/01/18

In a rare statement issued Friday night, special counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s team disputed BuzzFeedâ€™s explosive report Thursday that said President Donald Trump directed attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress.
 Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel, told BuzzFeed that its â€œdescriptionâ€\\x9d of statements to Muellerâ€™s office, as well as the â€œcharacterizationâ€\\x9d of documents and testimony the office obtained, was inaccurate.
 â€œBuzzFeedâ€™s description of specific statements to the Special Counselâ€™s Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohenâ€™s Congressional testimony are not accurate,â€\\x9d Carr told BuzzFeed.
 The special counselâ€™s statement adds more confusion over what Muellerâ€™s team knows in its ongoing investigation into President Donald Trumpâ€™s ties to Russia.
 Citing two federal law enforcement officials involved in the investigation, BuzzFeedâ€™s Thursday night report claimed that Trump directed Cohen to lie about negotiations over a Trump Tower in Moscow.
 Muellerâ€™s office, the report said, learned of Trumpâ€™s orders to Cohen â€œthrough interviews with multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization and internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents.â€\\x9d
 According to BuzzFeed, â€œCohen then acknowledged those instructions during his interviews with that office.â€\\x9d
 Responding to the statement from Muellerâ€™s office on their report, BuzzFeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith said it stands by its reporting and asked the special counselâ€™s office to clarify its statement.
 â€œWe stand by our reporting and the sources who informed it, and we urge the Special Counsel to make clear what heâ€™s disputing,â€\\x9d Smith tweeted.
 In a follow-up statement on Saturday, a BuzzFeed spokesman told The New York Times that the news site had â€œre-confirmedâ€\\x9d its reporting and seen â€œno indication that any specific aspect of our story is inaccurate.â€\\x9d
 The special counselâ€™s statement Friday homed in on the statements, documents and testimony that was obtained by Mueller, but it did not directly dispute that Trump had directed Cohen to lie to Congress, nor did it make mention of the Trump Tower deal in Moscow.
 BuzzFeedâ€™s original reporting sent Democrats on Capitol Hill into a furor as it suggested that Trump may have obstructed justice, thus providing grounds for impeachment or criminal charges. Some top Democrats called on Mueller to release what his team knows about Trumpâ€™s Moscow deal as a matter of public duty.
 In a strong statement issued Friday night, Sen. Dianne Feinstein joined a chorus of her Democratic colleagues in threatening serious action, including impeachment, against Trump if the allegations proved true. Feinstein is a ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
 â€œWeâ€™ve previously known about attempts to develop Trump Tower Moscow and the misrepresentations surrounding those efforts,â€\\x9d Feinstein said.
 â€œNow, media reports say President Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about that business deal,â€\\x9d Feinstein continued. â€œIf true, the president committed a crime and must be held accountable.â€\\x9d
 Earlier Friday, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) revealed that his committee had already begun searching for witnesses and documents to confirm BuzzFeedâ€™s report.
 â€œOur committee is already working to secure additional witness testimony and documents related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal and other investigative matters,â€\\x9d Schiff said.
 â€œAs a counterintelligence concern of the greatest magnitude, and given that these alleged efforts were intended to interfere with our investigation, our Committee is determined to get to the bottom of this and follow the evidence wherever it may lead,â€\\x9d he added.
 Trump has maintained he is innocent and on Friday accused Cohen of lying to the special counsel in order to reduce his jail time.

TITLE: Nancy Pelosi Says Rashida Tlaib's 'Motherf**ker' Comment No Worse Than Trump

PUBLISHED: 2019/01/04

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is not upset over Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaibâ€™s vulgar comment on impeaching President Donald Trump, said just hours after Thursdayâ€™s swearing-in ceremony on the House floor.
 Asked for her reaction to Tlaibâ€™s â€œcolorful languageâ€\\x9d â€• the new Democratic congresswoman vowed to â€œimpeach that motherfucker,â€\\x9d referring to Trump â€• Pelosi said it was a free speech issue.
 â€œI probably have a generational reaction to it, but in any event Iâ€™m not in the censorship business,â€\\x9d she told MSNBCâ€™s Joy Reid in a town hall interview set to air in full Friday evening.
 â€œI donâ€™t like that language. I wouldnâ€™t use that language,â€\\x9d the House speaker continued, noting that she doesnâ€™t tell her colleagues what to say.
 â€œBut I donâ€™t think itâ€™s any worse than what the president has said,â€\\x9d she concluded. Trump infamously bragged about grabbing women â€œby the pussyâ€\\x9d in a leaked tape from 2005; since taking office he has referred to certain other nations as â€œshithole countriesâ€\\x9d and slung insults at a wide range of political foes.
 Pelosi reasoned that while Trumpâ€™s comments have the power to â€œimpact peopleâ€™s lives,â€\\x9d the new congresswomanâ€™s comments do not.
 Tlaib, who became one of the first Muslim women in Congress on Thursday, dropped the expletive as she spoke to a crowd of supporters at an event hosted by the progressive group MoveOn.
 Talking about her victory, she said: â€œAnd when your son looks at you and says, â€˜Mama, look, you won. Bullies donâ€™t win.â€™ And I say, â€˜Baby, they donâ€™t.â€™ Because weâ€™re gonna go in there, and weâ€™re gonna impeach the motherfucker.â€\\x9d
 As she passed the microphone, the crowd erupted into cheers.
 Pelosi told Reid that the comment might fire up Trumpâ€™s base, but doesnâ€™t actually make much of a difference to actual House business.
 Any controversy over Tlaibâ€™s comment concerns the â€œfreedom of speech of an individual member,â€\\x9d not the stance of the Democratic caucus, Pelosi said.
 Trump appeared to respond to Tlaib over Twitter Friday morning, writing: â€œThey only want to impeach me because they know they canâ€™t win in 2020, too much success!â€\\x9d

TITLE: Trump says he could keep shutdown going for months or years

PUBLISHED: 2019/01/02

WASHINGTON â€” President Trump and Democratic congressional leaders dug in Wednesday for a lengthy partial shutdown in a newly divided government after a White House meeting â€” the first in 22 days â€” could not break an impasse over Mr. Trumpâ€™s demands for billions of dollars for a border wall.
 During the contentious meeting in the Situation Room, Mr. Trump made his case for a wall on the southwestern border and rejected Democratsâ€™ proposals for reopening the government while the two sides ironed out their differences.
 â€œI would look foolish if I did that,â€\\x9d Mr. Trump responded after Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, posed the question to him directly, according to three officials familiar with the meeting who described it on the condition of anonymity. He said that the wall was why he was elected, one of the officials said.
 Democrats were equally adamant, according to another official who was present for the discussion. Pressed by Vice President Mike Pence and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the incoming minority leader, they refused to budge from their offer to devote $1.3 billion to border security. The official also insisted on anonymity to describe the private conversation.
 Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said after the meeting that he had no intention of putting Democratic bills to reopen the government to a vote if Mr. Trump would not sign them.
 â€œWeâ€™re hopeful that, somehow, in the coming days and weeks, weâ€™ll be able to reach an agreement,â€\\x9d Mr. McConnell told reporters at the Capitol, offering an ominous timeline.
 The events underscored the personal and political crosscurrents standing in the way of any compromise between a president unwilling to lose face with his core supporters on his signature campaign promise and newly empowered Democrats â€” poised to assume control of the House on Thursday â€” who refuse to give ground on an issue that has come to symbolize Mr. Trumpâ€™s immigration policies.
 With the partial government funding lapse dragging into its 12th day and affecting 800,000 federal employees, the confrontation in the Situation Room only served to highlight the depth of the divide.
 â€œCould be a long time, or it could be quickly,â€\\x9d Mr. Trump said of resolving the shutdown. â€œItâ€™s too important a subject to walk away from.â€\\x9d
 Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who is in line to be elected speaker on Thursday, said: â€œWe are asking the president to open up government. Why would he not do it?â€\\x9d
 â€œHe could not give a good answer,â€\\x9d Mr. Schumer said.
 Mr. Trump tried creative ways to persuade the Democrats that they should support his wall. At one point, he said Ms. Pelosi should back it because she was â€œa good Catholicâ€\\x9d and Vatican City is surrounded by a wall, according to one of the officials familiar with the discussion.
 In her first legislative act as speaker, Ms. Pelosi plans on Thursday to bring up two bills to reopen the government. One would fund the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8, providing a month to break the impasse over border security funding, and a second would provide money for the remaining shuttered agencies and departments through September. The homeland security measure would devote $1.3 billion to border security measures, such as enhanced surveillance and fortified fencing, but not the wall.
 Mr. Trumpâ€™s rejection of those measures left the prospects of a resolution at their dimmest since the shutdown began on Dec. 22. It also highlighted the difficulty of the current situation, in which Democrats, Republicans and even some White House staff members have found themselves trying to anticipate what Mr. Trump will accept.
 The president asked the congressional leaders to return to the White House on Friday to continue the talks, after Democrats had completed their leadership elections, according to an official who attended the meeting. A second official who attended said Mr. Trumpâ€™s team believed it would be easier for Ms. Pelosi to negotiate once she was officially installed as speaker. Both insisted on anonymity to describe the private gathering.
 In a pair of evening tweets, Mr. Trump seemed to hold out hope of an agreement, writing: â€œI remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Letâ€™s get it done!â€\\x9d
 But the path to such a deal is murky at best.
 Before he met congressional leaders on Wednesday, Mr. Trump publicly rejected a compromise that Mr. Pence floated privately with Democrats last month to stave off the government funding lapse, saying $2.5 billion in border security spending was insufficient. In the hours before a midnight deadline to avert a shutdown before Christmas, the vice president had broached that number, which his team has quietly continued to push in the days after parts of the government ran out of money.
 â€œNo, not $2.5 billion, no â€” weâ€™re asking for $5.6â€\\x9d billion, Mr. Trump said during a cabinet meeting, hours before the Situation Room briefing.
 His rejection of the figure seemed to confirm the concerns of Democratic leaders who had questioned whether they could trust senior White House officials to broker any compromise that could then be rejected by a president who has often shifted his position at the last moment, especially when it comes to immigration.
 The larger figure referred to the amount Mr. Trump has demanded for the wall, which the House endorsed in a vote last month, but which failed to garner even majority support in the Senate, where it would need 60 votes to prevail.
 But inside the Situation Room later on Wednesday, the proposal resurfaced and Mr. Trump appeared open to it, according to one of the officials present, as Mr. Pence and Mr. McCarthy pressed Democrats to meet in the middle. Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer said $1.3 billion was their highest bid.
 Wednesdayâ€™s gathering in the Situation Room, a secure chamber in the basement of the White House where military operations are tracked and other sensitive discussions unfold, was a conscious effort by Mr. Trump and his aides to infuse a sense of national-security crisis into the immigration discussion. It was the presidentâ€™s first face-to-face meeting with Democratic leaders since a combative session last month when he said he would insist that any government spending bill include money for a border wall â€” and would proudly own the consequences if that meant a shutdown.
 But it quickly turned tense as Mr. Trump argued for his wall and called on Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, who appeared via teleconference from the border in San Diego to stress the need for it, according to two of the officials who were at the meeting.
 Mr. Schumer interjected, calling on Ms. Pelosi, who disputed Ms. Nielsenâ€™s statistics, two of the officials said. Ms. Pelosi then laid out the legislative proposals she planned to bring up on Thursday, detailing how the spending measures had all received broad bipartisan support either in committees or on the floor in the Republican-controlled Congress.
 The back and forth drew an angry response from the Department of Homeland Security.
 â€œDemocrats in the room either donâ€™t care that there is a humanitarian crisis on the border or just prefer ignorance,â€\\x9d Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement on Wednesday night. â€œIt was incredibly disheartening that they donâ€™t want to know the facts when making policy.â€\\x9d
 Yet hours before the meeting began, what was billed as a somber security briefing had already taken on the sharp tone of a political showdown, as Mr. Trump charged that Democrats were sacrificing border security for a partisan advantage in the 2020 elections.
 â€œThe United States needs a physical barrier,â€\\x9d the president said during the cabinet meeting, comparing the southern border to â€œa sieveâ€\\x9d that allows criminals and drugs to enter the country and facilitates human trafficking.
 â€œWalls work,â€\\x9d he added, claiming inaccurately that former President Barack Obama has one â€œaround his compoundâ€\\x9d in Washington. (Parts of Mr. Obamaâ€™s home in the northwest section of the city are bordered by a low brick retaining wall, and others have iron or chain-link fencing.)
 Mr. Trump repeated his false claims about the border wall, including that Mexico was already paying for it, as he promised during his campaign, and that much of its construction had already been completed.
 Outside the White House, the search for a way out is getting more urgent. Some lawmakers have grown anxious about the shutdownâ€™s impact on their constituents, including federal workers who are not receiving pay while their agencies are denied funding.
 Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, wrote an opinion article in The Washington Post suggesting three ways out: Grant the president the $1.6 billion for border security that he requested, without wall funding, plus an additional $1 billion for security at ports of entry; approve a bipartisan bill linking wall funding with protection for young immigrants brought illegally to the country as children; or resurrect the 2013 comprehensive immigration overhaul that included huge increases in border security measures, sweeping changes to immigration law and a pathway to citizenship for the nationâ€™s 11 million undocumented immigrants.
 Incoming lawmakers vented new concerns about the shutdownâ€™s effect. â€œThis morning I requested that my pay be withheld until the shutdown is over,â€\\x9d Representative-elect Mikie Sherrill, Democrat of New Jersey, said Wednesday on Twitter, where she posted a letter to the chief administrative officer of the House making her request official.
 She noted that thousands of federal workers in her state were not receiving paychecks. â€œI came here to govern, not engage in partisan politics at the expense of hardworking Americans,â€\\x9d she said.

TITLE: House Passes Democratsâ€™ Centerpiece Anti-Corruption and Voting Rights Bill

PUBLISHED: 2019/03/08

WASHINGTON â€” The House passed the Democratsâ€™ showcase anti-corruption and voting rights legislation on Friday, an expansive measure that aims to dismantle barriers to the ballot box, end big money in politics and impose stricter ethics rules on federal officials.
 The sweeping legislation, passed 234-193, makes good on the campaign pledge to clean up Washington that helped catapult Democrats into the majority. It also serves as a campaign platform for Democrats ahead of 2020. It has virtually no chance of passing the Senate.
 â€œItâ€™s a power grab for the American people,â€\\x9d said Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, who leads the House administration committee that shepherded the legislation.
 The ambitious compendium, at nearly 700 pages, includes proposals designating Election Day as a federal holiday, automatically registering citizens to vote, and restoring voting rights to people who have served felony sentences. It also creates a six-to-one matching system for donations of up to $200 to congressional and presidential candidates who reject high-dollar contributions, funded by an additional fine on corporations found to have broken the law.
 Republicans arguably have spent more time trying to define the bill â€” called the For the People Act or H.R. 1, to underscore its primacy â€” and tear it down than Democrats have spent trying to promote it. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has branded it the â€œDemocrat Politician Protection Actâ€\\x9d in weekly speeches, and pledged not to take up the legislation. The House Republican leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, also criticized the legislation.
 â€œThis bill is a massive federal government takeover that would undermine the integrity of our elections,â€\\x9d Mr. McCarthy said in a speech on Friday, in an attack on â€œthis new, Democrat, socialist majority.â€\\x9d
 Some of the most debated provisions are intended to reveal who funds online political ads and finances so-called dark-money groups. The Disclose Act, part of the bill, would require super PACs and nonprofit organizations that spend money in elections to disclose the names of donors who contribute more than $10,000. Democrats say such disclosure is broadly popular with voters across the political spectrum.
 â€œCongress cannot meaningfully address the nationâ€™s significant challenges without first recognizing and acknowledging the undue influence of special interests in our politics,â€\\x9d said Representative Abigail Spanberger, Democrat of Virginia.
 Some of those provisions, however, have drawn criticism from both conservative and liberal groups that argue the language is overly broad and would infringe on First Amendment rights. The American Civil Liberties Union urged members to vote against the bill.
 Democrats have also used the legislation to make clear that they believe that cleanup must start with the White House, and included several provisions jabbing at the president and homing in on a laundry list of his administrationâ€™s alleged ethical abuses.
 It would require presidents and vice presidents, as well as candidates for the nationâ€™s highest offices, to release at least 10 years of federal tax returns â€” Mr. Trump has released none â€” and it stipulates that inaugural committees must disclose their expenditures.
 And an amendment sponsored by Representative Raul Ruiz of California would prohibit federal funds from being spent at businesses owned or controlled by the president, the vice president or any cabinet official. Federal agencies spent about $13 million on four of Mr. Trumpâ€™s trips to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in early 2017, according to a report by a nonpartisan congressional watchdog agency issued last month.
 Two other measures also zero in on the costs of administration officialsâ€™ travel. One provision would require the Defense Department to regularly report to Congress details of the costs of presidential travel; the other would prohibit political appointees from using federal funds to pay for travel on noncommercial or private flights for official business.
 â€œWe must hold our government leaders to the highest standards, and with so many high-profile ethics violations in the past years, it is clear we have failed to do that,â€\\x9d Representative Tom Oâ€™Halleran, Democrat of Arizona and the sponsor of the amendments, said in a statement.
 Democrats also successfully put down an attempt by Republicans to divide the caucus and tar the legislation with a resolution expressing the sense that â€œallowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting power of United States citizens.â€\\x9d
 Republicans have repeatedly ambushed Democrats â€” twice successfully â€” with politically freighted procedural motions in a drive to divide Democrats and draw out vulnerable swing-district members. But determined not to let that taint their signature legislation and fired up by a rousing speech from freshman Representative Max Rose of New York, Democrats held steady.

TITLE: Demands for Adam Schiff's Head Highlight Chasm That Only Widened With Mueller's Conclusion

PUBLISHED: 2019/03/28

WASHINGTON â€” The House Intelligence Committeeâ€™s first hearing since Robert S. Mueller III completed his report had barely begun when the panelâ€™s Republicans moved en masse to demand the resignation of the committeeâ€™s chairman.
 It went downhill from there.
 The acrimony on display Thursday as the intelligence committee tried to resume its work on Russiaâ€™s intervention in the 2016 presidential election laid bare the bitter divide that persists in Congress even after Mr. Mueller, the special counsel, completed his 22-month investigation of the subject. The Republican demand and the barbed response of the committeeâ€™s chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff, echoed well outside the wood-paneled House hearing room.
 Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, spent much of his weekly news conference comparing Mr. Schiff, a fellow Californian, to Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, who fueled fears in the 1950s that Communist spies had infiltrated the American government. Representative Michael R. Turner, Republican of Ohio, played the same card in the hearing room, fuming that Mr. Schiff would not accept Attorney General William P. Barrâ€™s word that Mr. Mueller had not found the Trump campaign to have taken part in a conspiracy to undermine the election.
 â€œWith McCarthyism,â€\\x9d a senator was â€œchasing after Russian Communists,â€\\x9d Mr. Turner, an Intelligence Committee member, said. â€œNow we have Schiff chasing after Russian collusion.â€\\x9d
 Undaunted, Mr. Schiff made clear he was not about to step down, nor was he about to absolve President Trump or his campaign from nefarious conduct with Moscow â€” especially without seeing Mr. Muellerâ€™s report first. The Justice Department revealed on Thursday that the report came in at more than 300 pages, raising more questions about what information was behind the four-page summary released by Mr. Barr.
 Mr. Schiff had many questions of his own.
 â€œYou might think that itâ€™s O.K. that the presidentâ€™s son-in-law sought to establish a secret back channel of communications with the Russians through a Russian diplomatic facility. I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s O.K. You might think itâ€™s O.K. that an associate of the president made direct contact with the G.R.U. through Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks; that is considered a hostile intelligence agency,â€\\x9d Mr. Schiff said, referring to Russian military intelligence and a Russian intelligence hacker.
 He continued: â€œYou might think that itâ€™s O.K. that the national security-designate secretly conferred with the Russian ambassador about undermining U.S. sanctions. And you might think itâ€™s O.K. he lied about it to the F.B.I. You might say thatâ€™s all O.K. You might say thatâ€™s just what you need to do to win. But I donâ€™t think itâ€™s O.K. I think itâ€™s immoral. I think itâ€™s unethical. I think itâ€™s unpatriotic. And yes, I think itâ€™s corrupt.â€\\x9d
 Democrats who now control the House say that they will accept Mr. Muellerâ€™s findings, but as Mr. Schiffâ€™s monologue indicated they are increasingly determined not to let go of what they see as a deeply troubling pattern of wrongdoing by Mr. Trump, his businesses and his administration.
 That has in turn enraged Republicans, who have happily embraced what they call Mr. Muellerâ€™s absolution of Mr. Trump. They say Democrats will stop at nothing to ruin his presidency, and bristle at Democrats accusing them of turning a blind eye to the Russian threat. And at the center of their wrath is Mr. Schiff, whose doughy-faced demeanor hardly evokes an attack dog.
 â€œThe findings of the special counsel conclusively refute your past and present assertions and have exposed you as having abused your position to knowingly promote false information, having damaged the integrity of this committee, and undermined faith in U.S. government institutions,â€\\x9d Representative K. Michael Conaway, Republican of Texas, said to Mr. Schiff.
 Reading from a letter signed by every Republican member of the committee, Mr. Conaway added, â€œYour actions both past and present are incompatible with your duties as chairman of this committee.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Trump intervened as well, accusing Mr. Schiff of â€œknowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking.â€\\x9d He â€œshould be forced to resign from Congress!â€\\x9d the president wrote on Twitter.
 Mr. Schiff, clearly prepared for the ambush, argued that there was a difference between prosecutors proving a criminal conspiracy and the committee investigating evidence of foreign compromise. The committeeâ€™s own investigative work would go on, he signaled, though outside the hearing room he has indicated that work may well need to shift course once Mr. Muellerâ€™s findings are fully understood.
 Democrats backed him. â€œHistory will clarify what has happened,â€\\x9d said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut.
 Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California praised Mr. Schiff as â€œcalm, professional, patriotic,â€\\x9d and said his work as the chairman of the committee has been â€œin stark contrast to the irresponsible and almost criminal behavior of the previous chair of the committee,â€\\x9d Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California.
 â€œWhat is the president afraid of â€” that he would go after a chairman of the committee?â€\\x9d she said. â€œI think theyâ€™re just scaredy-cats. They just donâ€™t know what to do.â€\\x9d
 The party gave Mr. Schiff a more formal nod of confidence this week as well. On Wednesday, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, House Democratsâ€™ campaign arm, announced that Mr. Schiff would serve as a key fund-raiser for the caucusâ€™s most vulnerable members to help put together a firewall to project the House majority.
 Out of the glare of the television cameras, Democrats are somewhat more circumspect.
 â€œIn the heat of the political moment just as the Republicans wanted to try to convict Hillary Clinton in the public sphere, Democrats probably contributed to the expectations that the outcome would be worse for the president than it was,â€\\x9d Mr. Himes said in an interview a day ahead of the hearing.
 Notably sitting out the fight was Mr. Nunes, whom Democrats have accused of many of the same abuses that Republicans accused Mr. Schiff of on Thursday and whose resignation they asked for last year. Mr. Nunesâ€™s sustained work last term to scrutinize the origins of the Russia investigation and accuse federal law enforcement officials of acting out of anti-Trump political bias sent convulsions through what in quieter times is one of Congressâ€™s more bipartisan bodies.
 â€œWe should not be used as a platform to spread false information and bizarre conspiracies,â€\\x9d Mr. Nunes said on Thursday in brief remarks before deferring to Mr. Conaway.
 Thursdayâ€™s showdown came, ironically enough, during a hearing with four subject experts on â€œPutinâ€™s Playbook: The Kremlinâ€™s Use of Oligarchs, Money and Intelligence in 2016 and Beyond.â€\\x9d Down the line, the witnesses warned that Vladimir V. Putinâ€™s Russia would only grow bolder in its efforts to destabilize western democracies, including the United States.
 â€œThe bad news is that there is a new ideological fight between Putinism and the West, and it has only just begun,â€\\x9d said Michael McFaul, an ambassador to Moscow under former President Barack Obama. â€œIn my estimation, we as a country are underestimating it.â€\\x9d
 The whole episode offered a sharp contrast to the Senate Intelligence Committee, which with a yawning pace and no-leaks team has continued apace with its own Russia investigation. The committeeâ€™s chairman, Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, said this week that he aimed to finish witness interviews in the coming weeks and issue the last in a series of reports on the panelâ€™s findings in the coming months.
 On Thursday, as Democrats and Republicans in the House traded recriminations, the Senate panel quietly called back for another interview with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trumpâ€™s son-in-law and senior adviser.

TITLE: House Democrats Pass Landmark Campaign Finance And Voting Rights Reform Bill

PUBLISHED: 2019/03/08

Democratsâ€™ landmark campaign finance, voting rights and ethics reform bill passed the House of Representatives on Friday.
 The For The People Act, which passed 234-193, was Democratsâ€™ top priority upon winning control of the House in the 2018 elections. It would dramatically expand voting access, create publicly funded House elections, enhance the transparency of money in politics, restore voting rights to millions of ex-felons, strengthen executive branch ethics law and end partisan gerrymandering.
 â€œThis is a historic day, a pivotal day, a day that will make a difference,â€\\x9d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said.
 The bill aims to answer rising attacks on voting rights from courts and politicians across the country, and also to stem the increasing inequality of campaign funding by empowering small donors with matching contributions from public funds, among many other things.
 The For The People Act â€œtakes power from the elites, special interests and the 1 percent and gives it to the American people,â€\\x9d Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) said.
 â€œThis vote is an opportunity to be on the right side of history,â€\\x9d Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) said. â€œIf not us, then who? If not now, then when?â€\\x9d
 House passage of the legislation is the result of a long collaborative process by the Democratic Party to prioritize campaign finance and voting rights reforms. The partyâ€™s Democracy Reform Task Force, endorsed by Pelosi and led by Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.), worked with lawmakers both old and new to bring together legislative ideas and craft them into a coherent package.
 Much of this work was begun while Democrats languished in the House minority. As a possible victory in the 2018 elections loomed, they made it clear that the reforms would be their No. 1 priority. This mission was driven not just by party leaders, but also by the candidates who would ultimately deliver Democrats their first majority in the House in eight years.
 One-hundred candidates, including those who won their 2018 races, signed a letter to Pelosi and other congressional leaders demanding the reforms be the first order of business. Many cited the endemic corruption of money in politics as a top complaint they heard on the campaign trail from constituents.
 The vote broke down on party lines, with Republicans in hardened opposition. During multiple committee hearings and floor debate, GOP representatives castigated the bill as a federal power grab designed to help Democrats win elections by allowing increased voting access and nonpartisan gerrymandering. They said the campaign finance disclosures and the public funding of elections assaulted free speech rights, the ethics laws were too broad and unnecessary, and the creation of a federal election day holiday was an unnecessary benefit for lazy workers.
 The Senate will not take up the bill, according to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).
 McConnell is perhaps the nationâ€™s biggest opponent of campaign finance reforms, and the Republican Party has enacted measures across the country in the last decade to restrict voter access. Those restrictions would be overturned by the For The People Act.
 Still, Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) announced the outlines of a Senate companion bill on Wednesday. President Donald Trump has been advised to veto the legislation if it reaches his desk.
 Democrats believe that the reform package is popular and plan to vote on individual pieces of it to keep the issues of corruption and voting rights front and center. They are already pursuing a reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act in a separate bill. And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on Thursday that he would like to mandate automatic voter registration across the country.
 The House bill â€œis just the first step in our efforts to change politics in this country â€• to change politics in this town,â€\\x9d freshman Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.) said on Thursday ahead of the vote.
 â€œThis is a fight that will not end until we win it,â€\\x9d Pelosi said.

TITLE: Adam Schiff urged to step down as chairman by House Intelligence Committee Republicans

PUBLISHED: 2019/03/28

Every Republican on the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday demanded Rep. Adam Schiff step down as chairman over the California Democratâ€™s repeated claims to have evidence of Trump-Russia collusion.
 In a letter, obtained by Fox News and signed by every Republican on the committee, the lawmakers slammed Schiff for his claims in the media that there was â€œmore than circumstantial evidenceâ€\\x9d of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. They repeated their demand in person during a feisty hearing Thursday morning.
 â€œYour actions both past and present are incompatible with your duty as Chairman of this Committee,â€\\x9d the letter stated. â€œWe have no faith in your ability to discharge your duties in a manner consistent with your Constitutional responsibility and urge your immediate resignation as Chairman of this Committee.â€\\x9d
 The letter follows the conclusion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe, which turned up no evidence of collusion between Trump campaign members and Russia during the 2016 presidential election.
 President Trump himself went even further than congressional Republicans Thursday morning, tweeting:
 â€œCongressman Adam Schiff, who spent two years knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking, should be forced to resign from Congress!â€\\x9d
 Another top Republican, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, also lambasted Schiff on Thursday - comparing the California lawmaker to director Oliver Stone.
 "He's made some pretty outrageous comments that Mueller could not verify, Graham said. "He's getting into conspiracy land and he's acting like an Oliver Stone type figure. That to me is not helpful to him but I'm not going to ask him to resign for Congress."
 Schiff, a vocal critic of the president, has doubled down on his claim that Trump and his administration colluded with foreign powers despite Muellerâ€™s findings.
 â€œUndoubtedly, there is collusion,â€\\x9d Schiff told The Washington Post after Attorney General William Barr's four-page summary of Mueller's investigation was released Sunday. He told the paper that the question of whether Trump or the people around him were compromised by a hostile foreign power was not in any part of Muellerâ€™s report.
 The letter to Schiff was sent as those same Republicans confronted Schiff at the start of a Russia-themed hearing Thursday morning.
 Rep. Michael Conaway, R-Texas, attacked Schiff for driving a â€œfalse narrativeâ€\\x9d about collusion between Trump and Russia and â€œundermining the faithâ€\\x9d of the American people. Conaway then went on to demand Schiff immediately resign his committee chairmanship, saying that Republicans on the committee have â€œno faith in you.â€\\x9d
 Schiff defended himself during Thursdayâ€™s hearing â€“ pointing to evidence of Russian hacking during the last presidential election, that Russian operatives offered dirt on Hillary Clinton during the campaign and that members of Trumpâ€™s campaign and family took meetings with Russians.
 â€œYou might think thatâ€™s okay that they lied about the meeting,â€\\x9d Schiff said. â€œI donâ€™t think thatâ€™s okay.â€\\x9d
 Schiff on Monday signed a letter with his fellow House committee chairs demanding the full Mueller report by April 2.
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said earlier this week that the mounting calls to remove Schiff were "absolutely ridiculous." She consulted with Schiff and other committee leaders over the weekend as Barr notified Congress of Mueller's report and summarized the details.
 A Pelosi aide said Schiff was being attacked because he's done "an outstanding job."
 "Democrats aren't going to be intimidated by the White House or Congressional Republicans," spokeswoman Ashley Etienne said. "We're not going to be distracted from securing the release of the full Mueller report and the underlying evidence, and we will continue to pursue legitimate oversight because that's what the Constitution requires."

TITLE: Trump Declares a National Emergency, and Provokes a Constitutional Clash

PUBLISHED: 2019/02/15

WASHINGTON â€” President Trump declared a national emergency on the border with Mexico on Friday in order to access billions of dollars that Congress refused to give him to build a wall there, transforming a highly charged policy dispute into a confrontation over the separation of powers outlined in the Constitution.
 Trying to regain momentum after losing a grinding two-month battle with lawmakers over funding the wall, Mr. Trump asserted that the flow of drugs, criminals and illegal immigrants from Mexico constituted a profound threat to national security that justified unilateral action.
 â€œWeâ€™re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border, and weâ€™re going to do it one way or the other,â€\\x9d he said in a televised statement in the Rose Garden barely 13 hours after Congress passed a spending measure without the money he had sought. â€œItâ€™s an invasion,â€\\x9d he added. â€œWe have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country.â€\\x9d
 But with illegal border crossings already down and critics accusing him of manufacturing a crisis, he may have undercut his own argument that the border situation was so urgent that it required emergency action. â€œI didnâ€™t need to do this, but Iâ€™d rather do it much faster,â€\\x9d he said. â€œI just want to get it done faster, thatâ€™s all.â€\\x9d
 The presidentâ€™s decision incited instant condemnation from Democrats, who called it an unconstitutional abuse of his authority and vowed to try to overturn it with the support of Republicans who also objected to the move.
 â€œThis is plainly a power grab by a disappointed president, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process,â€\\x9d Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a joint statement.
 Mr. Trumpâ€™s announcement came during a freewheeling, 50-minute appearance in which he ping-ponged from topic to topic, touching on the economy, China trade talks and his coming summit meeting with North Koreaâ€™s leader, Kim Jong-un. The president again suggested that he should win the Nobel Peace Prize, and he reviewed which conservative commentators had been supportive of him, while dismissing Ann Coulter, who has not.
 Sounding alternately defensive and aggrieved, Mr. Trump explained his failure to secure wall funding during his first two years in office when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress by saying, â€œI was a little new to the job.â€\\x9d He blamed â€œcertain people, a particular one, for not having pushed this faster,â€\\x9d a clear reference to former Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, a Republican.
 Mr. Trumpâ€™s assertions were replete with misinformation and, when challenged by reporters, he refused to accept statistics produced by his own government that conflicted with his narrative.
 â€œThe numbers that you gave are wrong,â€\\x9d he told one reporter. â€œItâ€™s a fake question.â€\\x9d
 On point after point, the president insisted that he would be proved correct. â€œPeople said, â€˜Trump is crazy,â€™â€\\x9d he said at one point, discussing his outreach to Mr. Kim. â€œAnd you know what it ended up being? A very good relationship.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Trump acknowledged that his declaration of a national emergency would be litigated in the courts and even predicted a rough road for his side. â€œLook, I expect to be sued,â€\\x9d he said, launching into a mocking riff about how he anticipated lower court rulings against him. â€œAnd weâ€™ll win in the Supreme Court,â€\\x9d he predicted.
 Indeed, Public Citizen, an advocacy group, filed suit by the end of the day on behalf of three Texas landowners whose property might be taken for a barrier. California and New York likewise announced that they will sue over what Gov. Gavin Newsom of California called the presidentâ€™s â€œvanity project,â€\\x9d and a roster of other groups lined up to do the same. â€œFortunately, Donald Trump is not the last word,â€\\x9d said Mr. Newsom, a Democrat. â€œThe courts will be the last word.â€\\x9d
 Among those predicting a flurry of judicial decisions against Mr. Trump was George T. Conway III, a conservative lawyer and the husband of Kellyanne Conway, the presidentâ€™s counselor. â€œIf he knows he is going to lose,â€\\x9d Mr. Conway, a vocal critic of Mr. Trump, wrote on Twitter, â€œthen he knows he is violating the Constitution and laws he has sworn to uphold.â€\\x9d
 The House Judiciary Committee announced Friday that it would investigate the presidentâ€™s emergency claim, while House Democrats plan to introduce legislation to block it. That measure could pass both houses of Congress if it wins the votes of the half-dozen Republican senators who have criticized the declaration, forcing Mr. Trump to issue the first veto of his presidency.
 The emergency declaration, according to White House officials, enables the president to divert $3.6 billion from military construction projects to the wall. Mr. Trump will also use more traditional presidential discretion to tap $2.5 billion from counternarcotics programs and $600 million from a Treasury Department asset forfeiture fund.
 Combined with $1.375 billion authorized for fencing in the spending package passed on Thursday night, Mr. Trump would have about $8 billion in all for barriers, significantly more than the $5.7 billion he unsuccessfully demanded from Congress.
 The president opted not to tap hurricane relief money from Texas or Puerto Rico, an idea that had generated angry complaints from Republicans. But he expressed no concern that diverting military construction money would delay projects benefiting the troops like base housing, schools and gyms. â€œIt didnâ€™t sound too important to me,â€\\x9d he said.
 Neither the White House nor the Pentagon had yet identified which projects may be shelved as a result, but Pentagon lawyers and other officials planned to work over the weekend to identify which construction funds would be diverted.
 The declaration also provided that land may be transferred to the Defense Department from other federal agencies or from privately purchased or condemned land. The next step would be to secure those lands, where the Pentagon would erect barriers. The declaration gives Patrick Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, broad latitude to carry out this process.
 Most Americans oppose Mr. Trumpâ€™s emergency declaration, according to polls. One released this week by Fox News found 56 percent against it, including 20 percent of Republicans.
 Mr. Trumpâ€™s desire for approval by Fox and other conservative news outlets was on display when he identified various pundits as supporters, naming Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Tucker Carlson and Rush Limbaugh, although he insisted that â€œthey donâ€™t decide policy.â€\\x9d
 But Ms. Coulter, who has viscerally attacked Mr. Trump for caving on the wall, has clearly gotten under his skin. â€œI donâ€™t know her,â€\\x9d he said before quickly correcting himself. â€œI hardly know her. I havenâ€™t spoken to her in way over a year.â€\\x9d He noted, though, that she was an early predictor of his election victory. â€œSo I like her, but sheâ€™s off the reservation,â€\\x9d he said. â€œBut anybody that knows her understands that.â€\\x9d
 Ms. Coulter fired back shortly afterward. â€œThe only national emergency is that our president is an idiot,â€\\x9d she said on KABC radio in Los Angeles.
 White House officials rejected criticism from across the ideological spectrum that Mr. Trump was creating a precedent that future presidents could use to ignore the will of Congress. Republicans have expressed concern that a Democratic commander in chief could cite Mr. Trumpâ€™s move to declare a national emergency over gun violence or climate change without legislation from Congress.
 â€œIt actually creates zero precedent,â€\\x9d Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, told reporters. â€œThis is authority given to the president in law already. Itâ€™s not as if he just didnâ€™t get what he wanted so heâ€™s waving a magic wand and taking a bunch of money.â€\\x9d
 Presidents have declared national emergencies under a 1970s-era law about five dozen times, and 31 of those prior emergencies remain active. But most of them dealt with foreign crises and involved freezing property, blocking trade or exports or taking other actions against national adversaries, not redirecting money without explicit congressional authorization.
 White House officials cited only two times that such emergency declarations were used by presidents to spend money without legislative approval â€” once by President George Bush in 1990 during the run-up to the Persian Gulf war, and again by his son, President George W. Bush, in 2001 after the terrorist attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania.
 In both of those cases, the presidents were responding to new events â€” the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and Al Qaedaâ€™s assault on the United States â€” and were moving military funds around for a military purposes. Neither was taking action specifically rejected by Congress.
 In Mr. Trumpâ€™s case, he is defining a longstanding problem at the border as an emergency even though border apprehensions have actually fallen in recent years, to 400,000 in the last fiscal year from a peak of 1.6 million in the 2000 fiscal year. And unlike either of the Bushes, he is taking action after failing to persuade lawmakers to go along with his plans through the regular appropriations process.
 The spending package passed Thursday by Congress included none of the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump demanded for 234 miles of steel wall. Instead, it provided $1.375 billion for about 55 miles of fencing. Mr. Trump signed the package into law on Friday anyway to avoid a second government shutdown after the impasse over border wall funding closed the doors of many federal agencies for 35 days and left 800,000 workers without pay.
 For weeks, Republicans led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky urged Mr. Trump not to declare a national emergency, but the president opted to go ahead anyway to find a way out of the political corner he had put himself in with the failed effort to force Congress to finance the wall.
 Mr. McConnell privately told the president that he would support the move despite his own reservations, but warned Mr. Trump that he had about two weeks to win over critical Republicans to avoid having Congress vote to reject the declaration.
 Mr. Trump was among those Republicans who criticized President Barack Obama for using his executive authority to spare millions of illegal immigrants from deportation after failing to persuade Congress to do so. â€œRepubs must not allow Pres Obama to subvert the Constitution of the US for his own benefit & because he is unable to negotiate w/ Congress,â€\\x9d Mr. Trump tweeted in 2014.
 But Mr. Trump sought to drive home the personal toll of illegal immigration, inviting to the Rose Garden several relatives of Americans killed by people in the country without authorization. Some of the relatives, known as â€œangel moms,â€\\x9d stood up holding pictures of loved ones who had died.
 â€œMatthewâ€™s death was preventable and should have been prevented,â€\\x9d one of the women, Maureen Maloney, said in an interview after the event. Her son Matthew Denice, 23, was killed in 2011 in a motorcycle accident in Massachusetts after colliding with an automobile driven by an undocumented immigrant. â€œHe should have never been here in the first place,â€\\x9d she said. â€œIf he wasnâ€™t here, it wouldnâ€™t have happened.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Trumpâ€™s Border Wall Shutdown Continues Into A New Congress With A Democratic House

PUBLISHED: 2019/01/02

WASHINGTON â€• President Donald Trumpâ€™s partial government shutdown over his border wall closed in on the two-week mark and a brand-new Congress on Wednesday with no end in sight.
 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker-to-be Nancy Pelosi made their first visit to the White House since their Dec. 11 meeting with Trump, when he said he would be â€œproudâ€\\x9d to take responsibility for a government shutdown in his effort to force Congress to spend billions of dollars on a wall along the southern border. On Wednesday, the Democratic leaders emerged from the White House after 90 minutes, unified on not giving in to Trump.
 â€œThey are now feeling the heat,â€\\x9d Schumer said.
 Pelosi, who is expected to return to the House speakership Thursday afternoon after eight years as minority leader, intends as her first action to pass spending bills that won Republican support last year to reopen the closed agencies.
 â€œWeâ€™re asking the president to open the government,â€\\x9d she told reporters on the White House driveway. â€œWe are giving him a Republican path to do that. Why would he not do that?â€\\x9d
 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, though, said he will not take up legislation that Trump has not endorsed, which means the shutdown will continue.
 About a quarter of the federal government ran out of operating money at midnight Dec. 21 after Trump reneged on his commitment to a sign a short-term spending bill that had already passed the Senate on a unanimous vote. Trump changed his mind after Fox News and talk radio hosts ridiculed him for again backing down on his demand for wall money.
 Trump is now insisting that Congress appropriate $5.7 billion for that project, while Democrats want a short-term spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security and full-year funding for the other affected agencies while funding for the wall is negotiated separately.
 In the meantime, about 800,000 federal employees â€• about half furloughed, half deemed â€œessentialâ€\\x9d and required to work anyway â€• face real problems with their household finances. Many will miss their first paycheck on Jan. 11 unless Trump signs a spending bill before then. Employees would have to dip into their savings or borrow money to pay their bills, as there is no government program to help them.
 Trump, however, did not mention them during extended remarks he offered shortly before his meeting with the eight top Democratic and Republican congressional leaders.
 When asked how long the shutdown would last, the president replied, â€œAs long as it takes,â€\\x9d calling his wall, a signature campaign promise, a matter of â€œnational security.â€\\x9d
 Trumpâ€™s comments came at what was billed as the first Cabinet meeting of 2019. Instead, Trump spent the first hour and a half of it complaining about a variety of issues, such as former Defense Secretary James Mattisâ€™ performance and the late Sen. John McCainâ€™s vote against Trumpâ€™s repeal of Obamacare, as well as offering his musings on such things as the utility of wheels and his desire for Russia to invade Afghanistan again.
 Trumpâ€™s remarks were riddled with falsehoods on everything from trade to the number of illegal immigrants in the country to the way NATO works.
 The White House did not respond to HuffPost queries about whether Trump understood that what he was saying was false and, if he did, why he was doing so anyway.
 Trump promised hundreds of times during his campaign that the wall would cost taxpayers nothing because he would get Mexico to pay for it. But since taking office, Trump has never asked Mexico for payment. Instead, he began threatening to shut down the government early last year unless Congress gave him billions of dollars to build it â€• even though the type of structure he wants remains unclear.
 During the campaign, he promised a â€œgreat, greatâ€\\x9d wall made of reinforced concrete that would rise 30 feet or more and extend so far underground that it would be impossible to tunnel underneath. In recent months, he has at times said the wall could just be steel slats, which would be like the â€œbollard fencingâ€\\x9d developed during President Barack Obamaâ€™s administration.
 In a tweet Wednesday morning, Trump claimed, falsely, that Mexico was already paying for a border wall, thanks to a newly renegotiated trade deal, and that the wall was already largely done but he needed billions of dollars anyway.
 Despite numerous requests over several weeks, the White House has not provided any economic analysis to back up Trumpâ€™s claims. Outside economists and trade experts, however, said the revisions in the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump has rebranded the United States Mexico Canada Agreement, will not bring in to the U.S. Treasury anywhere near what is necessary to pay for a wall. More important, what extra money does come in will be from tariffs, which are paid by people in the U.S., not Mexico.

TITLE: 2020 Candidates Demand Full and Immediate Release of Mueller Report

PUBLISHED: 2019/03/22

CHARLESTON, S.C. â€” Democratic presidential candidates wasted no time Friday evening demanding the immediate public release of the long-awaited report from Robert S. Mueller III, with several saying that Americans deserved to know any findings about President Trump, Russia and the 2016 election in order to form judgments about Mr. Trump and the 2020 race.
 Former Representative Beto Oâ€™Rourke, campaigning in South Carolina on Friday night, told reporters that â€œthose facts, that truth, needs to be laid out for all Americans to be able to make informed decisions going forward, whether at the ballot boxâ€\\x9d or in their discussions with their senators and representatives.
 Mr. Oâ€™Rourke, asked if he supported impeaching Mr. Trump, said he believed the president and his 2016 campaign â€œat least sought to collude with the Russian government to undermine our democracyâ€\\x9d and that Mr. Trump â€œsought to obstruct justiceâ€\\x9d once in office.
 â€œI think those are grounds enough for members of the House to bring up the issue of impeachment,â€\\x9d he said. â€œBut whether they do or not, this will ultimately be decided by the American public at the ballot box in South Carolina and in every state of the union.â€\\x9d
 No voters brought up the Mueller report to Mr. Oâ€™Rourke as he spoke to them Friday. Indeed, in the hours after the announcement of the report, Democratic candidates reacted over Twitter or in remarks at events rather than in back-and-forth conversations with voters.
 Several candidates, in calling for the swift release of the report, also sought to gather new supporters and their email addresses by putting out â€œpetitionsâ€\\x9d calling for complete transparency from the Justice Department.
 â€œThe Trump Administration shouldnâ€™t get to lock up Robert Muellerâ€™s report and throw away the key,â€\\x9d Senator Cory Booker argued on Twitter, asking people to sign a petition and provide their names and emails. Such information is often used for future fund-raising solicitations.
 Within hours of Mr. Muellerâ€™s completing his investigation, Senator Elizabeth Warren and the campaign arm of House Democrats were already placing ads on Facebook demanding the full reportâ€™s release, with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee seeking 100,000 signatures for its online petition.
 With no detailed information available about the report, Ms. Warren and Mr. Booker â€” as well as Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris â€” sought to focus attention and pressure on how quickly Attorney General William P. Barr would release the full report.
 â€œAttorney General Barr â€” release the Mueller report to the American public. Now,â€\\x9d Ms. Warren wrote on Twitter.
 Ms. Gillibrand made similar demands and also retweeted the news of the report along with three words: â€œSee you Sunday.â€\\x9d That is when Ms. Gillibrand plans to formally kick off her 2020 campaign in front of Trump International Tower in New York.
 Ms. Harris, in addition to calling for the report to be released â€œimmediately,â€\\x9d called on Mr. Barr to â€œpublicly testify under oath about the investigation and its findings.â€\\x9d
 Ms. Harris, Ms. Warren and Ms. Gillibrand also joined Mr. Booker and Senator Bernie Sanders in asking supporters to sign their petitions calling for the reportâ€™s immediate release.
 Four other candidates â€” Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington; former Representative John Delaney; and JuliÃ¡n Castro â€” also called for the release of the full report.
 â€œAs Donald Trump said, â€™Let it come out,â€™â€\\x9d Mr. Sanders wrote on Twitter. â€œI call on the Trump administration to make Special Counsel Muellerâ€™s full report public as soon as possible. No one, including the president, is above the law.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Trump warns shutdown could last 'years,' says he may declare 'national emergency' to build border wall

PUBLISHED: 2019/01/04

President Trump stood firm Friday on his demands for a border wall after the second White House meeting with congressional leaders this week broke up with no apparent deal, warning Democrats the partial government shutdown could last "years" and saying he could even declare a "national emergency" to bypass Congress if necessary.
 â€œWe can call a national emergency [to build a border wall] because of the security of our country,â€\\x9d Trump told reporters in the Rose Garden, during a lengthy and impromptu press conference.
 â€œI may do it,â€\\x9d he said, before adding, â€œIf we can do it through a negotiated process, weâ€™re giving it a shot.â€\\x9d
 The press conference underscored how far apart both sides are, even as Trump called the meeting "productive" and suggested the standoff could end soon -- or not.  He indicated he was not shifting on his demand for more than $5 billion for funding for a wall on the southern border, saying it was necessary as the border is a "dangerous, horrible disaster."
 "This is national security weâ€™re talking about, weâ€™re not talking about games," he told reporters.  â€œWe're not playing games, we have to do it."
 Despite Trump saying conversations had "come a long way," Democrats were more dour in their assessment.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer exited saying Trump told them "heâ€™d keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.â€\\x9d
 Trump later confirmed in the Rose Garden, "Absolutely I said that," while clarifying he hopes the partial shutdown doesn't last more than a few more days.  He said it could be opened "very quickly" if they come to an agreement on the wall.  He offered some flexibility only on what the wall would be made of, saying it could be concrete or steel.
 "Steel is more expensive than the concrete, but I feel like weâ€™re talking about steel because the other side feels better about it," he said.
 Yet House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Democrats' view is that they cannot resolve the funding dispute until the government fully opens.  She said there had been progress only in the sense of a "better understanding" of each other.
 Looking for an elusive resolution, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Trump agreed to designate staff to engage in negotiations with congressional leadership aides this weekend.  Trump later said the group would "determine what we're going to do about the border."  That group would include Vice President Pence and advisor Jared Kushner.
 The meeting came on the 14th day of the shutdown, which was triggered by disagreements over the funding of Trumpâ€™s promised wall, after Democrats formally took control of the House of Representatives.  Trump has said that $5 billion in funding for the wall is non-negotiable, while Democrats have said they will fund more general border security -- but not the wall.
 Trump met with Democratic and Republican leaders of both chambers.  Ahead of the meeting Trump sent a letter to members of Congress congratulating Pelosi on her election as speaker and calling on Congress to re-open the government.
 â€œAs we begin this new Congress, our first task should be to reopen the Government and to deliver on our highest duty as elected officials: the security of the Nation and its borders," he said.  â€œIt is the sovereign right of every nation to establish an immigration program in its national interestâ€”lawfully admitting those who have followed the rules, while denying entry to those who break the rules or fail to meet the requirements established in law."
 As part of his strategy, he made available to every member a presentation on border security that he said those present at a meeting Wednesday did not want to hear.
 â€œAmericans have endured decades of broken promises on illegal immigration.  Now, is the time for both parties to rise above the partisan discord, to set aside political convenience, and to put the national interest first,â€\\x9d he wrote.
 Democrats, meanwhile, passed legislation in the House that would fund the whole government, but not the wall.   Pelosi accused Republicans of holding government workers hostage for the separate demand of a wall.
 "The wall and the government shutdown really have nothing to do with each other," Pelosi said at an MSNBC Town Hall.
 "There is no reason to have workers pay a price with their paycheck," she said
 The legislation was immediately dismissed by Republican leadership.  McConnell, R-Ky., called the bills â€œa time-wasting act of political posturingâ€\\x9d and said that â€œa resolution will have to be palatable to House Democrats and Senate Republicans alike.â€\\x9d
 â€œWe need to make policy rather than simply making political theatre,â€\\x9d he told reporters.
 White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said on "Fox & Friends" earlier Friday that it would be up to Pelosi to get her party behind her, including the left flank pushing for impeachment.
 â€œWe think we're hopeful because the people that elected Nancy Pelosi didn't elect her to come up here and do nothing and didn't elect her to play political games,â€\\x9d she said.  â€œThey elected her to find real solutions and actually work with the president and work with all members of Congress to get things done.â€\\x9d
 On Thursday night, Pence said on Fox News' â€œTucker Carlson Tonightâ€\\x9d that the terms of the negotiations were clear: "Bottom line, if there's no wall, there's no deal."

TITLE: As Mueller findings released, 2020 Dems demand to see 'whole damn report'

PUBLISHED: 2019/03/25

The 2020 Democratic presidential candidates may have faced a setback after Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation found no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, but made clear that they're not giving up the hunt for incriminating details against the president.
 Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, campaigning in San Francisco on Sunday, told the large crowd that, â€œI don't want a summary of the report! I want the whole damn report because nobody, especially this president, is above the law.â€\\x9d
 And on Saturday, one day before Attorney General William Barr released a short summary of Muellerâ€™s findings, former Texas Rep. Beto Oâ€™Rourke charged on the campaign trail in South Carolina that you â€œhave a president, who in my opinion beyond the shadow of a doubt, sought to, however ham-handedly, collude with the Russian government â€• a foreign power â€• to undermine and influence our elections.â€\\x9d
 He did not comment at length on Sunday, but did say at a campaign stop in Las Vegas that Trump is â€œone of the most racist and uncivil presidents we have ever had.â€\\x9d
 Muellerâ€™s nearly two-year-long investigation did not establish that members of Trumpâ€™s 2016 presidential campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government to interfere in the election in favor of Trump and at the expense of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
 Muellerâ€™s long-awaited findings also did not take a clear position on whether Trump obstructed justice, with no conclusions that the president committed a crime but also not exonerating Trump. Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Sunday concluded, though, that Muellerâ€™s report did not contain sufficient evidence to establish that Trump committed obstruction of justice.
 America Rising, a pro-Republican opposition research group, took aim at Oâ€™Rourke, saying on Sunday after Barrâ€™s announcement that the candidate made â€œbrazen and incorrect claims on the campaign trail.â€\\x9d
 Barr is expected to make public more of the report, but 2020 Democrats are demanding the full report be released.
 â€œThe Mueller report needs to be made public, the underlying investigative materials should be handed over to Congress, and Barr must testify. That is what transparency looks like. A short letter from Trump's hand-picked Attorney General is not sufficient,â€\\x9d Sen. Kamala Harris of California wrote on Twitter Sunday.
 Rourke demanded Barr â€œrelease the full Mueller report to the American people and their representatives."
 Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts pointed to a recent unanimous vote by Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives to urge the release of the report.
 â€œCongress didnâ€™t ask for a 'summary,' Attorney General Barr. Members of the House voted 420-0 to release the report. The American people deserve to see the full report. #ReleaseTheFullReport,â€\\x9d she wrote on Twitter.
 Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey wrote that the â€œAmerican public deserves the full report and findings from the Mueller investigation immediatelyâ€”not just the in-house summary from a Trump Administration official.â€\\x9d
 It was a similar call from Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who tweeted that â€œAG Barr's summary 4-pg letter of Special Counsel Mueller's investigation underscores that the ENTIRE report & documentation-including all information re Russiaâ€™s attempts to influence our election-need to be made public. The public deserves answers now-our democracy depends on it."
 And Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York also chimed in, demanding that the â€œMueller report must be made public. Not just a letter from someone appointed by Trump to protect himselfâ€”all of it. The President works for the people, and he is not above the law.â€\\x9d
 South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, whoâ€™s seen his campaign surge in recent days, also called for the entire report to be released. And in an interview on MSNBC, he pointed to the 2020 presidential election as the best way to oust Trump from the White House, saying, â€œI think this is further evidence that it would be a mistake for Democrats to think that the way for the Trump presidency to end is by way of investigation.â€\\x9d
 Former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland called for the report to be made public, but also urged that it was time to move on. He told Fox News Sunday night that â€œwhether you're a Democrat, Republican or independent, you should want to see this report, and we should want to move on from this."

TITLE: FBI's show of force in Roger Stone arrest spurs criticism of Mueller tactics

PUBLISHED: 2019/01/25

The FBI's pre-dawn arrest of President Trump's ex-adviser Roger Stone at his Florida home prompted critics to once again question the tactics of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, after more than a dozen special agents clad in tactical gear raided Stone's property Friday.
 Stone, 66, was taken into custody early Friday after being indicted by a federal grand jury a day earlier as part of Muellerâ€™s investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election.
 CNN, which conveniently happened to be staking out Stone's Fort Lauderdale home, posted video of the arrest that showed a team of FBI agents with guns banging on Stoneâ€™s door and demanding that he come outside.
 â€œAt the crack of dawn, 29 FBI agents arrived at my home with 17 vehicles, with lights flashing, when they could have contacted my lawyer,â€\\x9d Stone explained after a court appearance Friday.
 â€œBut the FBI agents were extraordinarily courteous.â€\\x9d
 Stone will appear on Fox News Channel's "Tucker Carlson Tonight" on Friday at 8 p.m. ET.
 Stoneâ€™s attorney added that the arrest was a â€œspectacle.â€\\x9d
 â€œA SWAT team, searching the house, scaring his wife, scaring his dogsâ€”it was completely unnecessary,â€\\x9d Stoneâ€™s attorney said.
 â€œA telephone call would have done the job, and he would have appeared.
 Mr. Stone has nothing to hide.â€\\x9d
 The arrest operation drew scrutiny on social mediaâ€”even from President Trump, who said â€œBorder Coyotes, Drug Dealers and Human Traffickers are treated better,â€\\x9d and questioned â€œwho alerted CNN to be there?â€\\x9d
 One federal law enforcement source told Fox News on Friday that the operation was â€œstandardâ€\\x9d for a home arrest.
 The source told Fox News that home arrests typically take place early in the morning with a team of FBI agents in protective gear, adding that Stoneâ€™s situation was â€œnothing out of the ordinary.â€\\x9d
 A former senior Justice Department official, now-white collar criminal attorney with Ifrah Law, James Trusty, told Fox News that while common procedure in white collar cases would involve a federal prosecutor contacting the defendantâ€™s attorney, Stoneâ€™s charges could have sparked a different approach.
 â€œIt shows that there is either a fundamental distrust of Mr. Stone, possibly due to the witness tampering charge, or that there was a real breakdown with his attorney,â€\\x9d Trusty said Friday.
 â€œThe wild card here is that in charging Stone with a form of obstruction of justice, the Mueller team may view it differently than typical white-collar investigations.â€\\x9d
 He added: â€œIf the FBI and the Mueller team believe Stone has engaged in witness tampering, then there is a palpable distrust, which would make them err on the side of surprise, rather than a courtesy phone call.â€\\x9d
 The 24-page indictment released early Friday alleges that Stone worked to obstruct the House Intelligence Committeeâ€™s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election by making false statements to the committee, denying he had records sought by the committee and persuading a witness to provide false testimony.
 The indictment does not charge Stone with conspiring with WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy website that published the emails, or with the Russian officers Mueller says hacked them.
 Instead, it accuses him of witness tampering, obstruction and false statements about his interactions related to WikiLeaks' release.
 But former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Joseph diGenova blasted the tactic as â€œoutrageous.â€\\x9d
 â€œI am appalled that the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI have permitted a vindictive use of arrest in a non-violent case with a defendant who was willing to surrender,â€\\x9d diGenova, who has informally been an adviser to the president throughout the Russia investigation, told Fox News.
 â€œThis is an abuse of power and it underscores the vindictive nature of it by the fact that CNN was alerted ahead of time.â€\\x9d
 He added: â€œFor those of us who have been prosecutors and have prosecuted mob figures, drug dealers and terroristsâ€”those are the people for whom these aggressive tactics are reserved.
 Not a Roger Stone.â€\\x9d
 â€œMake no mistake,â€\\x9d he said.
 â€œThis was designed to be vindictive and intimidating.â€\\x9d
 DiGenova likened the FBI arrest of Stone to the bureauâ€™s early morning raid last summer of the home of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.
 Stone on Friday said he would plead not guilty to the charges leveled against him by the special counselâ€™s team, and said he â€œlooks forward to being fully and completely vindicated.â€\\x9d
 â€œI believe this is a politically motivated investigation,â€\\x9d Stone said Friday.
 â€œThere is no circumstance whatsoever under which I will bear false witness against the president, nor will I make up lies.â€\\x9d
 Stone served as an adviser to Trump for years before Trump ran for president.
 He left Trumpâ€™s campaign in August 2015, but maintained regular contact with and publicly supported the Trump campaign throughout the 2016 presidential election.
 Muellerâ€™s investigation, which was initially ordered to look into the 2016 election, has gone on for more than a year and half.
 It has expanded to probe financial crimes of Trump associates before the election, conversations Trumpâ€™s national security adviser had with the Russians during the transition and whether Trump obstructed justice with his comments and actions related to the probe.
 Twenty-six Russian nationals and three Russian companies have been charged with interfering in the 2016 presidential election.
 But none of the Trump associates connected to Trump have been charged with crimes related to collusion.
 Other convictions include former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, who both pleaded guilty to making false statements in 2017.
 Former campaign adviser Rick Gates in 2018 pleaded guilty and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted and later pleaded guilty in a separate financial crimes case dating back before the 2016 election.
 Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements in a case brought by Mueller in November.
 Alex van der Zwaan, a London-based lawyer, pleaded guilty to making false statements this year, and Richard Pinedo, a California man, pleaded guilty to identity fraud in 2018.

TITLE: Trump says he appreciates Muellerâ€™s statement disputing BuzzFeed report

PUBLISHED: 2019/01/19

President Trump on Saturday said he appreciates FBI special counsel Robert Mueller releasing a statement disputing parts of a BuzzFeed news report claiming Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the timing of discussions over a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow.
 â€œI thought that the BuzzFeed piece -- and maybe equally as bad the coverage of the BuzzFeed phony story -- it was a total phony story, and I appreciate the special counsel coming out with a statement last night, I think it was appropriate that they did so, I appreciate that,â€\\x9d he told reporters.
 "I think that the BuzzFeed piece was a disgrace to our country, it was a disgrace to journalism and I think also that the coverage by the mainstream media was disgraceful and I think it's going to take a longtime for the mainstream media to recover its credibility," he went on to say.
 "It's lost tremendous credibility."
 BuzzFeed published the story on Thursday, citing two law enforcement officials who said Cohen -- Trumpâ€™s former longtime attorney -- acknowledged to Muellerâ€™s office that he was told to lie to Congress about the potential real-estate deal in Moscow, telling Congress that the negotiations ended months before they did so as to conceal Trumpâ€™s involvement.
 The article said that Cohenâ€™s testimony â€œmarks a significant new frontier: It is the first known example of Trump explicitly telling a subordinate to lie directly about his own dealings with Russia.â€\\x9d
 BuzzFeed also reported that Trump backed a plan, set up by Cohen, to visit Russia during the presidential campaign, meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in person and begin the negotiations.
 Muellerâ€™s team is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election and rarely issues statements about the state of the investigation or disputing reports in the press.
 But on Friday, after Democrats had called for investigations and hinted at impeachment proceedings, the special counselâ€™s office took the extraordinary step of releasing a statement disputing the article.
 â€œBuzzFeedâ€™s description of specific statements to the special counselâ€™s office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohenâ€™s Congressional testimony are not accurate,â€\\x9d Peter Carr, a spokesman for Muellerâ€™s office, said.
 It did not offer further details about what it disputed.
 BuzzFeedâ€™s editor in chief, Ben Smith, later tweeted that â€œwe stand by our reporting and the sources who informed it, and we urge the Special Counsel to make clear what heâ€™s disputing.â€\\x9d
 Trumpâ€™s team had also denied the claims in the article.
 Trump himself said Friday evening that the controversy was â€œa very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our country.â€\\x9d
 Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on Friday also praised Muellerâ€™s office for â€œcorrecting the Buzzfeed false storyâ€\\x9d and asked the press to take heed that their hysterical desire to destroy this President has gone too far.â€\\x9d
 In a statement Saturday aftternoon, BuzzFeed spokesman Matt Mittenthal doubled down on the organization's defense of its reporting.
 â€œAs weâ€™ve re-confirmed our reporting, weâ€™ve seen no indication that any specific aspect of our story is inaccurate.
 We remain confident in what weâ€™ve reported, and will share more as we are able," he said.

TITLE: Trumpâ€™s immigration offer brings sharp reactions from Dems and GOP

PUBLISHED: 2019/01/20

President Trumpâ€™s immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown drew sharp reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike.
 In a televised White House address on Saturday afternoon, Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, in exchange for the $5.7 billion he has been seeking for a barrier along the nation's southern border with Mexico.
 â€œOur immigration system should be a source of pride ... not a source of shame as it is all over the world,â€\\x9d Trump said in his plea.
 The presidentâ€™s proposal was met with disdain from an array of top Democratic lawmakers. Many used the same language in their critiques, accusing Trump of holding the government and federal workers "hostage."
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., tweeted, â€œWhat we didnâ€™t hear from the President was any sympathy for the federal workers who face so much uncertainty because of the chaos of the #TrumpShutdown.â€\\x9d
 Before Trump made his announcement, Pelosi had called his anticipated proposal â€œa non-starter.â€\\x9d
 â€œFor one thing, this proposal does not include the permanent solution for the Dreamers and TPS recipients that our country needs and supports.â€\\x9d
 For his part, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, called Trump's proposal "one-sided and ineffective."
 "It's clear the President realizes that by closing the government and hurting so many American workers and their families, he has put himself and the country in an untenable position. Unfortunately, he keeps putting forward one-sided and ineffective remedies. There's only one way out: open the government, Mr. President, and then Democrats and Republicans can have a civil discussion and come up with bipartisan solutions."
 Schumer, D-N.Y., concluded, "It was the President who single-handedly took away DACA and TPS protections in the first place â€“ offering some protections back in exchange for the wall is not a compromise but more hostage taking."
 House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer shared a similar sentiment, urging Trump and Sen. Mitch McConnell to "stop holding government hostage and end the shutdown" immediately.
 â€œThe president must stop holding government hostage and end the shutdown so federal employees can get back to work serving the American people. There is no reason for Americans to be shut out of work and without a paycheck while negotiations take place on the best way to secure our borders,â€\\x9d he said.
 Hoyer said negotiation can progress after the government reopens.
 â€œWith the government open, we can negotiate an agreement to strengthen border security that both sides can support and that is in the best interests of the American people.â€\\x9d
 Another leading Dem, Sen. Kristen Gillibrand of New York, who announced her White House bid on Jan. 15 in an episode of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," said Trump's offer was a "bad deal."
 Gillibrand tweeted: "Trump ordered the end of DACA and TPS. Then he shut down the government. Now he's holding federal workers hostage, saying he'll temporarily give back what he took away -- only if we give him a pointless, ineffective wall he falsely promised Mexico would pay for. This is a bad deal."
 Then there was New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez's response. He bluntly accused Trump of forcing "a pointless shutdown" to pay for the border wall.
 "This is about more than 800,000 Americans who are being held hostage by a President who has forced a pointless shutdown to pay for an expensive, ineffective wall. This is not about immigration. Dreamers and TPS recipients are not bargaining chips. It's unacceptable that after taking away DACA protections, eliminating the TPS program for thousands of immigrants and creating a humanitarian crisis at the border, President Trump is offering temporary solutions in exchange for a permanent wall."
 The Democratic senator also said "a legitimate negotiation" can proceed after the government is reopened.
 Fellow Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware slammed McConnell for refusing "to meaningfully negotiate with Senate Democrats," but also called Trump's offer "a first step toward comprehensive immigration reform."
 "This senseless government shutdown is hurting millions of Americans, and its impacts are only getting worse. The President should re-open the government so that Republicans and Democrats in Congress can work with the White House to find a sensible solution on border security and immigration. I am confident that a reasonable compromise can be reached, but not while President Trump continues to keep significant parts of the government shut down and Leader McConnell refuses to meaningfully negotiate with Senate Democrats," he said.
 "Some relief for Dreamers and an extension of Temporary Protected Status represent a first step toward comprehensive immigration reform, but more ideas from members of both parties should be taken up and debated. Republicans and Democrats stand ready to work toward a solution, but the fact remains that there is no reason to have large parts of the federal government shut down while we debate appropriate border security and immigration policies."
 Republican lawmakers, at the opposite end of the reaction spectrum, praised the president for his willingness to negotiate.
 Senate Majority Leader McConnell, for instance, commended the president "for taking bipartisan steps toward addressing current immigration issues."
 In his statement, he said; â€œCompromise in divided government means that everyone canâ€™t get everything they want every time. The presidentâ€™s proposal reflects that. It strikes a fair compromise by incorporating priorities from both sides of the aisle."
 â€œThis bill takes a bipartisan approach to re-opening the closed portions of the federal government. It pairs the border security investment that our nation needs with additional immigration measures that both Democrat and Republican members of Congress believe are necessary. Unlike the bills that have come from the House over the past few weeks, this proposal could actually resolve this impasse. It has the full support of the President and could be signed into law to quickly reopen the government."
 Republican Whip Steve Scalise called on Democrats to match Trump's willingness to negotiate.
 "The time for political games has long passed. Democrats must put their personal dislike of the president aside, end their obstruction, and finally come to the negotiating table. It's time Democrats do what is right for the functioning and security of our nation and agree to a deal that opens our government, and includes funding for a border wall and other measures to solve this serious immigration crisis at our southern border," he said in a statement.
 Also on the Republican side, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she was "hopeful" for a "constructive debate" with Democrats.
 â€œCompromise is not a sign of weakness â€” itâ€™s a sign of strength, particularly when hundreds of thousands of families are being harmed. The Administration, Senate Republicans, and Democrats must now resolve this stalemate before 800,000 federal workers and their families miss yet another paycheck, and our economy is further damaged,â€\\x9d she said.
 Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, whose views on the president and his policies have fluctuated, said Trump "put forth a reasonable, good faith proposal that will reopen the government and help secure the border."
 He tweeted, "I look forward to voting for it and will work to encourage my Republican and Democratic colleagues to do the same.
 Earlier, while speaking in Ogden, Utah, Romney said he did not understand Pelosi's position on border security.
 "You (Pelosi) and your fellow Democrats have voted for over 600 miles of border fence in the past, why won't you vote for another few miles now? I don't understand their position, I really don't," the Republican senator said.
 Florida Sen. Marco Rubio took a positive view of Trump's proposed deal, like his fellow Republicans. He said Trump made "a very reasonable offer" and urged Democrats to work with him.
 â€œThe way to end this shutdown is for both sides to make mutual concessions in order to reach an agreement. The president has made a very reasonable offer to extend DACA and TPS protections in exchange for the border security measures he supports. I hope that instead of choosing the road of endless obstruction, Democrats will decide to work with him to reach an agreement and end the shutdown,â€\\x9d he said.
 Likewise, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy called the president's immigration offer "reasonable."
 McCarthy tweeted: "President Trump has put forward a serious and reasonable offer to reform parts of our broken immigration system and reopen government. The moment now turns to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. The country is watching."

TITLE: Mueller Statement Disputes Report That Trump Directed Cohen to Lie

PUBLISHED: 2019/01/18

WASHINGTON â€” The special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election disputed on Friday a report that said President Trump had directed Michael D. Cohen, his longtime lawyer and fixer, to lie to Congress about his role in negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow.
 The rare public statement by a spokesman for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, challenged the facts of an article published by BuzzFeed News on Thursday saying that Mr. Cohen had told prosecutors about being pressured by the president before his congressional testimony.
 â€œBuzzFeedâ€™s description of specific statements to the special counselâ€™s office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohenâ€™s congressional testimony are not accurate,â€\\x9d said the spokesman, Peter Carr.
 Before Mr. Carrâ€™s statement, the BuzzFeed report led to a flurry of reactions by senior members of Congress who said that the allegations, if true, could be grounds for initiating impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump.
 The president himself responded on Twitter late Friday, calling the special counselâ€™s statement â€œa very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our Country!â€\\x9d
 A proven effort by Mr. Trump to pressure a witness to commit perjury would be one of the most damning revelations so far in the investigation into Russiaâ€™s attempts to sabotage the 2016 presidential election and could be the cornerstone of a case that the president obstructed justice to keep investigators at bay.
 Both the White House and lawyers for Mr. Trump vigorously denied the BuzzFeed report even before the special counselâ€™s office weighed in.
 â€œTwo words sum it up better than anything anybody else can say, and that is â€™categorically false,â€™â€\\x9d the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, told reporters on Friday.
 BuzzFeed News maintained that its report was accurate, its editor, Ben Smith, said after Mr. Muellerâ€™s office disputed the account. â€œWe stand by our reporting and the sources who informed it, and we urge the Special Counsel to make clear what heâ€™s disputing,â€\\x9d Mr. Smith said on Twitter.
 The statement by Mr. Carr, the special counselâ€™s spokesman, was unusual because it appeared to be the first time he had publicly challenged the facts of a news media account that had generated significant attention for its revelations about the president.
 The New York Times has not independently confirmed the BuzzFeed report. One person familiar with Mr. Cohenâ€™s testimony to the special counselâ€™s prosecutors said that Mr. Cohen did not state that the president had pressured him to lie to Congress.
 Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that his panel would investigate the BuzzFeed report and was â€œalready working to secure additional witness testimony and documents related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal and other investigative matters.â€\\x9d
 If true, Mr. Schiff said, the allegations â€œwould constitute both the subornation of perjury as well as obstruction of justice.â€\\x9d
 Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas, another Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, wrote in a tweet that â€œif the @BuzzFeed story is true, President Trump must resign or be impeached.â€\\x9d
 Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Friday that the panel expected Mr. Cohen to be back to testify privately in early February.
 The report added another jolt to a chaotic week for the White House, which has had to fend off questions about recent revelations that F.B.I. counterintelligence agents began investigating Mr. Trump in 2017 and that Mr. Trump has tried to conceal the details from senior administration officials about his interactions with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
 In a December court filing, prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller described how Mr. Cohen had repeatedly lied to Congress both about the length of negotiations over the Trump Tower Moscow deal and about Mr. Trumpâ€™s involvement in the project.
 Mr. Cohen had told lawmakers that the negotiations ended in January 2016 â€” before the first presidential primaries â€” and were never discussed extensively among executives of the Trump Organization. In fact, according to prosecutors, the discussions continued as late as June 2016, after Mr. Trump was the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.
 They also said Mr. Cohen discussed the progress of the Moscow project with Mr. Trump more frequently than he had told the committee and had briefed members of Mr. Trumpâ€™s family about the negotiations.
 When he appeared in court to plead guilty to lying to Congress, Mr. Cohen said he had concealed his interactions with Russian officials and the fact that he asked Mr. Trump to travel to Russia to promote the deal because he wanted to support Mr. Trumpâ€™s â€œpolitical messaging.â€\\x9d
 That day, Mr. Trump defended his role in the Trump Tower Moscow discussions, brushing aside concerns that he was advancing his business interests at the time he was hoping to become president. â€œThere was a good chance that I wouldnâ€™t have won, in which case I would have gotten back into the business, and why should I lose lots of opportunities?â€\\x9d he told reporters.
 Mr. Cohen drafted his statement to Congress in August 2017 along with Steven Ryan, his lawyer at the time, according to people familiar with how the testimony was put together. Mr. Ryan was working with lawyers for the Trump family as part of a joint defense agreement.
 At least one of Mr. Trumpâ€™s personal lawyers saw Mr. Cohenâ€™s congressional testimony before he delivered it in August and October 2017, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.
 Mr. Cohen initially repeated his false statements about the Moscow tower to prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller after he pleaded guilty in August to campaign finance violations and financial crimes. But he corrected himself during subsequent interviews and proved credible, the special counselâ€™s office said in a December sentencing memo.
 Mr. Cohen said he initially lied because he did not want to contradict his congressional testimony, prosecutors said. Subsequently, he took care â€œnot to overstate his knowledge or the role of others in the conduct under investigationâ€\\x9d and provided â€œuseful informationâ€\\x9d about his contacts with â€œpersons connected to the White Houseâ€\\x9d in 2017 and 2018, the special counselâ€™s filing said.
 That truthfulness was a departure from Mr. Cohenâ€™s pattern of deception throughout his professional life, according to a separate sentencing memo by federal prosecutors in New York, filed at the same time as Mr. Muellerâ€™s. Driven by greed, they said, he â€œrepeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Cohen was sentenced in December to three years in prison for lying to Congress, campaign finance violations and financial crimes. He said he took full responsibility for his crimes, but said he acted out of blind loyalty to Mr. Trump, who he said â€œled me to choose a path of darkness over light.â€\\x9d
 During his nomination hearing this week to become attorney general, William P. Barr was asked if the president would have committed a crime if he had coached a witness to testify falsely â€” or not to testify at all.
 â€œYes,â€\\x9d Mr. Barr said. â€œUnder an obstruction statute, yes.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Trump Caves To Democrats, Agrees To Reopen Government Short-Term Without Border Wall

PUBLISHED: 2019/01/25

President Donald Trump announced Friday a short-term plan that will reopen the government for three weeks so that border security negotiations may continue without the devastating effects of the partial government shutdown.
 Trump said heâ€™s prepared to sign a bill to open the government through Feb. 15. Federal employees will get back pay â€œvery quickly or as soon as possible,â€\\x9d he said. Shortly after the announcement, the Senate and House both passed a resolution to reopen the government through that date.
 The announcement comes on the 35th day of the longest shutdown in United States history and is a clear cave by Trump, whose impasse over the budget stems from his demands for $5.7 billion in funds for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border â€• a project Democratic lawmakers say is a firm deal-breaker.
 If funding for his border wall is not secured by the end of the negotiation period, Trump said he is prepared to shut down the government again or issue a national emergency declaration in order to get funding â€• a plan that would strip funding from disaster recovery efforts.
 Throughout the shutdown, Trumpâ€™s reputation has suffered across parties as airports have grappled with severe delays and federal workers have gone without paychecks, putting many at risk of losing their homes, defaulting on loans and missing other crucial payments.
 Trumpâ€™s statement comes a day after the Senate failed to pass his proposal to reopen the government with border wall funding in exchange for temporary legal protection for some undocumented immigrants.
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was in the middle of a roundtable with Capitol Hill reporters when reports began surfacing of Trumpâ€™s support for a short-term government funding bill. She was mum on whether she considered his proposal a final deal.
 â€œWeâ€™re going in that direction but weâ€™re not to that place,â€\\x9d said Pelosi. â€œIâ€™m hopeful.â€\\x9d
 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) spoke on the Senate floor shortly after Trumpâ€™s announcement, congratulating lawmakers on the development.
 â€œThe solution to this impasse was to separate funding the government from our disagreements over border security,â€\\x9d Schumer said, adding that â€œwe can never hold American workers hostage again.â€\\x9d
 Trump spent most of his speech on Friday rehashing his usual talking points about crime at the border.
 â€œWe really have no choice but to build a powerful wall or a steel barrier,â€\\x9d he said.

TITLE: Indicting Roger Stone, Mueller Shows Link Between Trump Campaign and WikiLeaks

PUBLISHED: 2019/01/25

WASHINGTON â€” The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, revealed on Friday the most direct link yet between parallel efforts by the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks to damage Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election using Democratic Party material stolen by Russians.
 A top Trump campaign official dispatched Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to President Trump, to get information from WikiLeaks about the thousands of hacked Democratic emails, according to an indictment. The effort began weeks after Democratic officials publicly accused Russian intelligence operatives of the theft, which was part of Moscowâ€™s broad campaign to sabotage the 2016 presidential race.
 The indictment made no mention of whether Mr. Trump played a role in the coordination, though Mr. Mueller did leave a curious clue about how high in the campaign the effort reached: A senior campaign official â€œwas directedâ€\\x9d by an unnamed person to contact Mr. Stone about additional WikiLeaks releases that might damage the Clinton campaign, according to the court document.
 In an indictment filled with colorful details about clandestine meetings, angry texts â€” even a reference to â€œThe Godfather: Part IIâ€\\x9d â€” Mr. Stone was charged with seven counts, including obstruction, making false statements and witness tampering. Mr. Mueller did not say that Mr. Stoneâ€™s interactions with WikiLeaks were illegal, nor that the Trump campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with the organization.
 F.B.I. agents arrested Mr. Stone before dawn, appearing at his Fort Lauderdale, Fla., home with ballistic vests and guns drawn. Agents typically use those tactics as a precaution to secure possible evidence and protect themselves in case a suspect fights arrest. Prosecutors sealed details of the case because they feared that public disclosure would increase the risk of Mr. Stone fleeing or destroying or tampering with evidence, according to court documents.
 F.B.I. agents were also seen carting hard drives and other evidence from Mr. Stoneâ€™s apartment in Harlem, and his recording studio in South Florida was also raided.
 Mr. Stone appeared briefly on Friday morning in Federal District Court in Fort Lauderdale, his ankles and waist shackled in front of a packed courtroom. A man known for his dapper wardrobe was dressed simply in a navy blue cotton polo shirt, bluejeans and his trademark round, black-rimmed glasses.
 Afterward, in a theatrical appearance outside the courthouse, Mr. Stone vowed to beat what he called politically motivated charges. â€œThere is no circumstance whatsoever under which I will bear false witness against the president, nor will I make up lies to ease the pressure on myself,â€\\x9d he said.
 â€œI look forward to being fully and completely vindicated,â€\\x9d he added, then flashed twin V-for-victory hand signs reminiscent of his political hero, former President Richard M. Nixon. In a brief interview later, Mr. Stone said he will plead not guilty, and people close to him have predicted that Mr. Trump could pardon Mr. Stone should he be convicted of any of the charges.
 The indictment is the first in months by Mr. Mueller, who is investigating Russiaâ€™s interference in the 2016 election and possible coordination with Trump associates. Citing details in emails and other forms of communications, the indictment suggested that Mr. Trumpâ€™s campaign knew about additional stolen emails before they were released and asked Mr. Stone to find out about them.
 According to the indictment, between June and July 2016, Mr. Stone told â€œsenior Trump campaign officialsâ€\\x9d about the stolen emails in WikiLeaksâ€™ possession that could be damaging to Mrs. Clinton. On July 22 that year, WikiLeaks released its first batch of Democratic emails. After that, according to the indictment, the Trump campaign sought more.
 â€œA senior Trump campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information Organization 1 had regarding the Clinton campaign,â€\\x9d the indictment said, referring to WikiLeaks.
 The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, sought to broadly distance Mr. Trump from the charges. â€œThe charges brought against Mr. Stone have nothing to do with the president,â€\\x9d she told CNN. Asked whether he directed a campaign aide to contact Mr. Stone about the WikiLeaks emails, she repeated that the charges did not involve Mr. Trump.
 A self-described dirty trickster, Mr. Stone began his career as a Nixon campaign aide and has a tattoo of Nixon on his back. He has spent decades plying the political dark arts â€” including scandal-mongering â€” to help influence American election campaigns, and has long maintained that he had no connection to Russiaâ€™s attempts to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.
 He sometimes seemed to taunt American law enforcement agencies, daring them to find hard evidence to link him to Moscowâ€™s interference; it is illegal for a political campaign to accept foreign aid. His brash behavior made him less of a subject of news media scrutiny than other current and former aides to President Trump â€” like the character in a whodunit whom readers immediately dismiss as too obvious to have committed the crime.
 The indictment does not mention whether Mr. Stone or any other Trump associate knew about the Russian operativesâ€™ plans before they hacked the Democrats.
 In social media posts and interviews during the 2016 presidential race, Mr. Stone indicated that he had advance knowledge that a trove of information damaging to Mrs. Clintonâ€™s campaign might be about to spill into public view, and even suggested that he had personally spoken to the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange.
 Mr. Stone has changed his story as investigators closed in, saying that he was not actually speaking to Mr. Assange and that he had no direct knowledge that Russians were responsible for the Democratic hacking. Still, it was revealed last year that, in the weeks before the election, Mr. Stone was messaging on Twitter with Guccifer 2.0, a pseudonym used by one or more operatives in the Russian intelligence scheme to steal the emails and funnel them to WikiLeaks.
 Three senior Trump campaign officials told Mr. Muellerâ€™s team that Mr. Stone created the impression that he was a conduit for inside information from WikiLeaks, according to people familiar with their witness interviews. One of them told investigators that Mr. Stone not only seemed to predict WikiLeaksâ€™ actions, but also that he took credit afterward for the timing of its disclosures that damaged Mrs. Clintonâ€™s candidacy.
 In October 2016, Mr. Stone exchanged emails with Stephen K. Bannon, then the chief executive of Mr. Trumpâ€™s campaign. In one exchange, Mr. Stone wrote that more WikiLeaks disclosures were forthcoming, â€œa load every week going forward,â€\\x9d according to the indictment. Mr. Bannon appears to be the official described in the court document as â€œthe high-ranking Trump Campaign official,â€\\x9d based on previous disclosures about the email exchange.
 A day before Mr. Stone and Mr. Bannon emailed about WikiLeaks, Donald Trump Jr. exchanged messages on Twitter with the WikiLeaks account and asked, â€œWhatâ€™s behind this Wednesday leak I keep reading about.â€\\x9d
 At the end of that week, on Oct. 7, WikiLeaks released more than 6,000 emails related to John D. Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign. The release, 30 minutes after The Washington Post published a recording of Mr. Trump bragging about assaulting women, appeared aimed at redirecting negative attention from Mr. Trump to the Clinton campaign.
 The special counselâ€™s investigators spent months encircling Mr. Stone, and the indictment unsealed on Friday detailed how he relied on several longtime associates to get information about the timing and content of WikiLeaksâ€™ document releases in the months before the election.
 They pored over his testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The indictment documented numerous lies to lawmakers about his efforts to set up a back channel to WikiLeaks, and about his efforts to pressure other witnesses to lie.
 He exchanged heated texts with Randy Credico, a New York radio host with his own contacts with WikiLeaks, pressuring Mr. Credico to lie to the Intelligence Committee so that his story would line up with Mr. Stoneâ€™s.
 Mr. Stone told Mr. Credico he should â€œdo a â€˜Frank Pentangeliâ€™â€\\x9d before the House committee, the indictment said, a reference to a â€œGodfatherâ€\\x9d character who lies to Congress about his interactions with the Mafia.
 The tumultuous relationship between Mr. Stone and Mr. Trump goes back decades, with Mr. Stone serving as an informal adviser as Mr. Trump considered running for president several times.
 When Mr. Trump formally announced during the spring of 2015 that he was running for president, Mr. Stone was one of the first to join his campaign. Within months, however, the two had a public dispute and Mr. Stone left the team. But they have remained close, speaking often by telephone.
 On Friday, the day that Mr. Stone stood on the steps of a courthouse and pledged his enduring loyalty to the president, Mr. Trump bashed the investigation that had led armed federal agents to his friendâ€™s house in the morning darkness.
 â€œGreatest Witch Hunt in the History of our Country!â€\\x9d he wrote on Twitter. â€œNO COLLUSION!â€\\x9d

TITLE: House approves sweeping Dem election reform bill, amid First Amendment concerns

PUBLISHED: 2019/03/08

The House of Representatives on Friday approved a sweeping election reform bill that serves as the touchstone to the House Democratic agenda but has been criticized by civil libertarians and Republicans over First Amendment concerns.
 The so-called â€œHR 1â€\\x9d measure embraced by House Democrats aims to curb big money in politics, make it easier to vote and bolster election security. It institutes a public financing system for congressional campaigns, requires presidential candidates to disclose tax returns and makes Election Day a federal holiday.
 The House approved the plan 234-193. But the measure is not expected to succeed in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said the bill is dead on arrival.
 The American Civil Liberties Union, in a recent letter to Congress, encouraged lawmakers to vote against the bill because of â€œprovisions that unconstitutionally impinge on the free speech rights of American citizens and public interest organizations.â€\\x9d
 â€œThey will have the effect of harming our public discourse by silencing necessary voices that would otherwise speak out about the public issues of the day,â€\\x9d the ACLU wrote.
 One concern of civil libertarians is the billâ€™s inclusion of the DISCLOSE ACT, which would require all organizations that spend money on elections to disclose donors.
 The ACLU said it supports making organizations report spending for public communications like TV ads that expressly call for the election or defeat of a candidate for office, but it worries the DISCLOSE ACT goes beyond that.
 â€œThese standards are unclear and entirely subjective, which will lead to confusion and, ultimately, less speech,â€\\x9d the ACLU said.
 Republicans called the bill a Democratic power grab that amounts to a federal takeover of elections.
 â€œNow, instead of getting money out of politics, the Democrats on this committee voted to pass a bill that will publicly fund â€“ campaign travel, campaign dinners, and in some cases, the politicians themselves,â€\\x9d Illinois Rep. Rodney Davis wrote in an op-ed for The Hill.
 The White House said in a statement that the Democrats' plan would "micromanage" elections that now are run largely by states and would establish "costly and unnecessary program to finance political campaigns."
 But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the bill "restores the people's faith that government works for the public interest, the people's interest, not the special interests."
 Trying to turn Republicans' words against them, Pelosi said, "Yes it is a power grab -- a power grab on behalf of the people."
 House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California said the legislation would undermine the integrity of elections by allowing convicted felons to vote, and would apply a one-size-fits-all standard to elections now run by states and local governments.
 Democrats called that a mischaracterization.
 To Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., the bill "grabs power away from the elites and the power brokers and gives it to the people."
 She and other Democrats disputed the claim that taxpayers will pay for campaigns, noting that money for political campaigns would come from a surcharge on federal settlements made with banks and corporations that run afoul of the law.

TITLE: Trump Associate Roger Stone Indicted In Mueller Investigation

PUBLISHED: 2019/01/25

Roger Stone, an eccentric longtime Republican strategist with a tattoo of Richard Nixonâ€™s face on his back, was arrested early Friday on criminal charges that include obstruction of an official proceeding, false statements and witness tampering.
 A federal grand jury impaneled by special counsel Robert Mueller charged Stone in a seven-count indictment. FBI agents arrested him at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and he appeared in court later Friday.
 CNN shared footage of FBI agents arriving at the property:
 Kristin Davis, the former Manhattan madam, reportedly told The Washington Postâ€™s Manuel Roig-Franzia that FBI agents also executed a search warrant at the New York City apartment she shared with Stone.
 Stone â€• who worked on presidential campaigns for Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and others â€• took credit for Donald Trumpâ€™s presidential run and served as an informal adviser after he left Trumpâ€™s campaign in August 2015.
 He repeatedly has said it was â€œa possibilityâ€\\x9d that he would be indicted in Muellerâ€™s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible Trump campaign collusion.
 Stone has previously admitted to being in contact with Julian Assange of WikiLeaks during the Trump campaign.
 The indictment alleges he spoke â€œto senior Trump Campaign officialsâ€\\x9d about WikiLeaks and â€œinformation it might have had that would be damagingâ€\\x9d to the campaign of Trumpâ€™s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in the summer before the election.
 Stone was â€œcontacted by senior Trump Campaign officials to inquire about future releasesâ€\\x9d by WikiLeaks, according to the indictment, which refers to WikiLeaks as â€œOrganization 1.â€\\x9d
 Stoneâ€™s attorney, Grant Smith, said in a statement that â€œthere was no Russian collusionâ€\\x9d and that the charges were â€œa clear attempt at silencing Roger.â€\\x9d
 After appearing in court on Friday, Stone said he plans to plead not guilty to the charges, saying he was â€œfalsely accusedâ€\\x9d and calling the investigation â€œpolitically motivated.â€\\x9d
 â€œI look forward to being fully and completely vindicated,â€\\x9d he said, while onlookers booed.
 He also affirmed that he does not plan to testify against Trump, but would not say if he seeks a pardon from the president.
 The July 2018 indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers in connection with the hack of a Democratic National Committee server during the 2016 election referred to Stone as â€œa person who was in regular contact with senior members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump.â€\\x9d
 Stone has described his contact with the Russians â€• who used the handle â€œGuccifer 2.0â€\\x9d â€• as â€œbenign.â€\\x9d He told The Washington Post that he met with a Russian national who wanted to sell Trump damaging information on Hillary Clinton for a sum of $2 million. The man had previously worked as an informant for the FBI, but told the Post that he was not working on the FBIâ€™s behalf when he met with Stone in May 2016.
 Stoneâ€™s indictment came after his associate Randy Credico, a radio show host, testified before the grand jury.
 Stone, according to the indictment, â€œon multiple occasionsâ€\\x9d around Dec. 1, 2017, told Credico (â€œPerson 2â€\\x9d) that he should â€œdo a â€˜Frank Pentangeliâ€™â€\\x9d in his testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence â€œto avoid contradicting Stoneâ€™s testimony.â€\\x9d
 It was a reference to the â€œFrankie Five Angelsâ€\\x9d character from â€œThe Godather: Part II,â€\\x9d whom the indictment alleges Stone and Credico had previously discussed. In the film, the character testifies and â€œclaims not to know critical information that he does in fact know,â€\\x9d the indictment recounts.

TITLE: Trump announces deal to end partial government shutdown

PUBLISHED: 2019/01/25

President Trump said Friday that he will support a short-term spending bill to re-open the government, temporarily ending the partial government shutdown that has dragged on for more than a month -- despite a day earlier saying Republicans would not â€œcaveâ€\\x9d on his demands for funding for a wall on the southern border.
 â€œI am very proud to announce we have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government,â€\\x9d he said to applause from gathered Cabinet members.
 He said the deal would keep the government open for three weeks until Feb. 15 and that a bill would go before the Senate immediately.
 He made reference to his previous threats to declare a national emergency, calling it a â€œvery powerful weapon,â€\\x9d but saying he didnâ€™t want to use it.
 The deal appeared to include no money for a wall or steel barrier, but he said he hoped negotiations would continue to come to an agreement on wall funding.
 "Walls should not be controversial," he said.
 The shutdown was sparked by disagreement over President Trumpâ€™s demand for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall or steel barrier on the southern border.
 Democrats countered initially with $1.3 billion for general border security, while Trump said initially he would not sign anything without wall funding.
 In the last few weeks, the fight turned particularly nasty -- with Trump canceling a Democratic congressional trip to Afghanistan after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on Trump to delay his State of the Union address or submit it in writing.
 Trump announced Thursday that he would delay the address, but if the government re-opens then it could take place on Tuesday as had been previously scheduled.
 After bills to re-open the government failed in the Senate Thursday, Trump signaled that a "large down payment" on funding, potentially less than the $5.7 billion, could be sufficient to end the stalemate.
 He suggested that a "prorated down payment" on the wall, without providing a concrete dollar figure, could be viable.
 Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., had also suggested that a three-week continuing resolution could be the way forward.
 "If they come to a reasonable agreement, I would support that," Trump told reporters.
 The partial closure of the government has led to hundreds of thousands of workers furloughed or working without pay, with groups representing the workers increasing their calls for D.C. to end the deadlock and get workers paid again.
 Many workers missed their second paycheck on Friday.
 Every former secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, including former White House chief of staff John Kelly, sent a letter to the president and Congress on Thursday asking them restore the departmentâ€™s funding.
 â€œDHS employees who protect the traveling public, investigate and counter terrorism, and protect critical infrastructure should not have to rely on the charitable generosity of others for assistance in feeding their families and paying their bills while they steadfastly focus on the mission at hand,â€\\x9d the letter said.
 â€œThis is unconscionable.â€\\x9d
 President Trump on Saturday announced a compromise plan that funded the wall while extending protections for 700,000 illegal immigrants brought to the country as children and 300,000 immigrants from countries designated unsafe to return.
 However, Democrats rejected the plan even before Trump announced it, and a Senate version of the plan failed to get the 60 votes needed on Thursday.
 A second bill, already passed by the Democrat-controlled House to re-open the government, also fell short.
 On Thursday, Trump had promised that Republicans â€œwill not cave" on border wall demands.

TITLE: Trump Offers Temporary Protections for â€˜Dreamersâ€™ in Exchange for Wall Funding

PUBLISHED: 2019/01/19

WASHINGTON â€” President Trump, facing a growing public backlash over the partial government shutdown, shifted course on Saturday and offered Democrats a deal: temporary protections for roughly 700,000 young undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border.
 But the proposal, which Mr. Trump unveiled in a 13-minute address from the White House, appeared dead on arrival in the Capitol. Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected it even before Mr. Trump spoke, and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, denounced the offer as â€œnot a compromise but more hostage taking.â€\\x9d
 With the shutdown entering its fifth week and polls showing a majority of the public blaming Mr. Trump, the presidentâ€™s advisers have been searching for an exit strategy. Saturdayâ€™s speech grew out of talks that Vice President Mike Pence and the presidentâ€™s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, have had in recent days with lawmakers including Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader.
 The proposal was Mr. Trumpâ€™s first public offer to Democrats since the partial shutdown began nearly a month ago. It came after an acrimonious week of tit-for-tat politics, in which Ms. Pelosi told the president he could not deliver his State of the Union address in the Capitol until the shutdown was over, and the president retaliated by grounding a plane that was supposed to take Ms. Pelosi on a fact-finding mission to Afghanistan.
 In casting the plan as a compromise, the president sought to shift pressure to Democrats â€” who have repeatedly refused to give Mr. Trump any money for his border wall â€” to end the shutdown. But Democrats continued to insist they will not negotiate with Mr. Trump over border security until the government reopens.
 Over the course of his administration, Mr. Trump has repeatedly sought to curb both legal and illegal immigration. He has revoked Temporary Protected Status, or T.P.S., which offers crucial protections for immigrants, for people from some Latin American and African countries. And he has moved to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, an Obama-era program that shielded the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation.
 In the deal he outlined on Saturday, Mr. Trump offered to restore T.P.S. protection for 300,000 people, and said he would allow 700,000 Dreamers to keep their protections for three more years in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier.
 â€œThat is our plan,â€\\x9d Mr. Trump said. â€œBorder security, DACA, T.P.S. Many other things. Straightforward, fair, reasonable and common sense with lots of compromise.â€\\x9d The proposal, Mr. Trump added, was intended to â€œbreak the logjam and provide Congress with a path forward.â€\\x9d
 The speech was the second time during the shutdown that the president addressed the nation about the immigration crisis. But unlike his first address, a prime-time broadcast from the Oval Office that leaned heavily on dark messaging about the dangers of crime and illegal drugs flowing across the border, Mr. Trump seemed on Saturday to soften his tone.
 He paired the address with his first naturalization ceremony at the White House, a move intended to underscore the idea that he supports legal immigration. And his language was markedly different; instead of insisting on the â€œbig beautiful wallâ€\\x9d he promised during his 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump took care to use the word â€œbarrierâ€\\x9d as well â€” and seemed to pare back his vision for it.
 Calling the wall â€œa powerful and beautifully designed see-through steel barrier on our southern border,â€\\x9d Mr. Trump said: â€œThis is not a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea. These are steel barriers in high priority locations. Much of the border is already protected by natural barriers such as mountains and water.â€\\x9d
 Mr. Trump noted that he had adopted some Democratic proposals on border security. The president proposed $800 million for humanitarian assistance and $805 million for drug detection technology, in addition to funding for 2,750 more border agents and law enforcement officials and 75 new immigration judge teams.
 In her talking points, issued to Democrats, Ms. Pelosi said her party favored â€œnew drug, weapons and contraband scanning technology at official ports of entry,â€\\x9d and â€œfilling the more than 3,000 vacancies for customs officers.â€\\x9d Ms. Pelosi also intends to bring up legislation in the coming days that includes an additional $1 billion for border security, including $563 million for 75 new immigration judges and support staff.
 Even so, Democrats roundly criticized the presidentâ€™s plan. They were particularly incensed that Mr. Trumpâ€™s offer extended protections to Dreamers and T.P.S. recipients that he himself revoked. And they said the deal was a nonstarter because it did not offer any permanent protections for Dreamers.
 â€œI think itâ€™s simply more fake promises raising false hopes,â€\\x9d Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said. â€œIt will fool few Americans because itâ€™s neither serious nor credible as a real remedy for Dreamers.â€\\x9d
 Some on the right also pushed back, describing the proposal as amnesty. James Carafano, a national security expert at the Heritage Foundation who worked on Mr. Trumpâ€™s transition, was among the critics. â€œAmnesty encourages further illegal immigration, incentivizes the tragedy of human trafficking and undermines our citizensâ€™ confidence in the rule of law,â€\\x9d he said.
 Mr. Pence, briefing reporters after Mr. Trumpâ€™s remarks, said the speech reflected a painstaking process of listening to lawmakers, including rank-and-file Democrats who made it clear they believed that protections for DACA and T.P.S. recipients must be included in a border security deal.
 And he pushed back forcefully against critics like Mr. Carafano who said the measure amounted to an unacceptable amnesty for undocumented immigrants.
 â€œThere is no pathway to citizenship in this proposal,â€\\x9d Mr. Pence said.
 But that was one reason many Democrats considered it unacceptable. Other senior administration officials made it clear that part of Mr. Trumpâ€™s strategy was to try to drive a wedge within the party between those who want to hold out for a much more generous solution and those who may feel enough political pressure to end the shutdown that they will feel obliged to support it.
 Noting that Tuesday is the deadline for the government to reopen in time to prevent federal employees from going a second consecutive pay period without a check, Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, said Senate Democrats had a tricky decision to make. He also noted that the presidentâ€™s ability to declare a national emergency was â€œabsolutelyâ€\\x9d still a tool available to Mr. Trump to find funds to build the wall if a legislative agreement could not be reached.
 Now it will be up to Mr. McConnell to put legislation incorporating Mr. Trumpâ€™s proposal on the Senate floor.
 Mr. McConnell â€” who has insisted he will not put any legislation on the floor unless the president will sign it â€” spoke to Mr. Trump, Mr. Kushner and Mr. Pence on Thursday night about finding a way forward.
 Mr. McConnell told the president that before he could bring up legislation on the Senate floor, he needed a â€œpublic reassuranceâ€\\x9d that Mr. Trump would sign it, one person close to the talks said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive discussions.
 The presidentâ€™s proposal â€œstrikes a fair compromise by incorporating priorities from both sides of the aisle,â€\\x9d Mr. McConnell said in a statement after Mr. Trumpâ€™s speech.
 If Mr. McConnell does indeed put a bill on the floor, as the president said he would, Senate Democrats will have to decide whether to block it or let it come up for a vote. Despite Democratsâ€™ vow to reject the measure, it could create an opening for negotiations between the two sides.
 The shutdown stalemate is creating increasing nervousness on Capitol Hill, especially among Republicans seeking re-election in Democratic-leaning states. One of them, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, is among only a handful of Republicans who have broken with the president and called for the government to reopen without a border security deal.
 On Saturday, she praised the president, saying she hoped that Mr. Trumpâ€™s offer would â€œlead to constructive debate that will end this impasse.â€\\x9d
 White House aides and allies of Mr. Trump said Saturday that Mr. Trump succeeded in ratcheting up the political pressure on Ms. Pelosi, especially if the Senate succeeded in passing a bill.
 â€œThe Democratsâ€™ talking points have been that the president is solely responsible for shutting down the government,â€\\x9d Marc Short, the former White House legislative director, said. â€œThis puts more onus on them to come back and say why this proposal is insufficient.â€\\x9d
 But one reason Democrats are so leery of the deal is that they have been down this road with the president before. Last year, Mr. Trump and Mr. Schumer negotiated $25 billion in wall money for a pathway to citizenship for the Dreamers. But that deal fell apart when hard-line White House advisers persuaded the president to back away.
 The standoff over the shutdown, some former aides noted, was the first time Mr. Trump has had to engage in meaningful, high-stakes negotiations. But even that has come as a last resort, in what some have likened to negotiating out of desperation after failing to score political points.

TITLE: Trump Declares National Emergency To Fund U.S.-Mexico Border Wall

PUBLISHED: 2019/02/15

President Donald Trump on Friday declared a national emergency at the southern U.S. border in an effort to unilaterally seize funding to begin building his long-promised wall between the U.S. and Mexico.
 Trump, who was accompanied by parents of children killed by unauthorized immigrants, said he was declaring the national emergency for â€œvirtual invasion purposes.â€\\x9d
 But he also acknowledged another reason: He didnâ€™t want to wait on Congress to approve the funds.
 â€œI could do the wall over a longer period of time â€• I didnâ€™t need to do this,â€\\x9d Trump said in a televised speech, even as he contended the situation on the southern border amounted to a national emergency. â€œBut Iâ€™d rather do it much faster.â€\\x9d
 Trump is also expected to approve Congressâ€™ spending bill, which grants him $1.375 billion for the wall, as opposed to the $5.7 billion he initially demanded. The national emergency declaration gives Trump a chance to reroute other government money to fund the project â€• and sets up a legal battle that could tie up the presidentâ€™s signature project for months or years.
 To justify the wall, Trump repeatedly insisted criminals, gang members and drug traffickers were pouring over the border and that only a wall could stop them.
 â€œWe have far more people trying to get into our country today than probably ever before,â€\\x9d Trump said.
 In fact, arrests for illegal border crossings are at their lowest levels since the 1970s. There were roughly 520,000 arrests for unauthorized border crossings last year, which is about one-third of the 1.6 million arrests that happened in 2000. Since 2014, a high proportion of those crossing have been Central American children and families seeking to make humanitarian claims such as asylum.
 The total wall funding will now come to about $8 billion, partially approved by Congress but mostly by Trump alone. That will buy the administration some 234 miles of border wall, a senior administration official told reporters Friday.
 The national emergency declaration will allow the Trump administration to use about $3.6 billion from Defense Department construction projects to build the wall, along with another $2.5 billion the department had allocated for counter-drug activities, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters.
 The Trump administration also plans to take executive action to move about $200 million from the Department of Homeland Security and another $600 million from the Treasury Departmentâ€™s asset forfeiture account.
 None of the money will come from hurricane relief, Mulvaney said.
 The DHS funding bill included restrictions on where new border wall could be constructed. Those restrictions wonâ€™t apply to the portions built with national emergency money, a senior administration official said.
 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced Thursday on the Senate floor that Trump planned to sign the bill and declare a national emergency at the same time, adding that he supported the decision. Congress passed a government funding bill Thursday evening.
 McConnell warned Trump in private that declaring an emergency would spark a backlash among Republicans, according to The Washington Post.
 A national emergency declaration grants a president the ability to circumvent certain government rules so that an administration can respond to a crisis. In this case, Trump is sidestepping Congress so that he can gain access to certain federal funds without congressional approval.
 Administration officials cited dozens of previous national emergency declarations, insisting that Trump would not break with historical precedent by â€œunlockingâ€\\x9d new pots of money for the border wall he seeks.
 â€œItâ€™s not as if he just didnâ€™t get what he wanted so heâ€™s waving a magic wand and taking a bunch of money,â€\\x9d Mulvaney said.
 The move is almost certain to be challenged in court.
 â€œAny crisis on our border is of President Trumpâ€™s own making: family separations, child detention, turning our backs on asylum seekers, and more. There is no national emergency,â€\\x9d California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who has sued the Trump administration multiple times, said in a statement. â€œIf Trump oversteps his authority and abandons negotiations with Congress by declaring a fabricated national emergency, we wonâ€™t only call his bluff, we will do what we must to hold him accountable.â€\\x9d
 Prior to the declaration, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the proclamation a â€œgross abuse of the power of the presidencyâ€\\x9d and vowed that â€œCongress will defend our constitutional authorities.â€\\x9d
 For two months, Democrats in Congress have been enmeshed in stalled negotiations with Trump as he refused to accept anything less than $5.7 billion in the federal budget for his border wall. The stalemate caused a record-breaking partial government shutdown that forced an estimated 800,000 government employees to go without pay for 35 days.
 Trump reopened the government for three weeks on Jan. 25, allowing government workers to get back to work as border security negotiations continued.
 In January, Trump asserted that he had â€œthe absolute right to declare a national emergency,â€\\x9d according to CNN. He called it â€œthe easy routeâ€\\x9d while insisting that heâ€™d rather Congress approve his border wall funding.

TITLE: Trump Signs Bill Reopening Government for 3 Weeks in Surprise Retreat From Wall

PUBLISHED: 2019/01/25

WASHINGTON â€” President Trump agreed on Friday to reopen the federal government for three weeks while negotiations continued over how to secure the nationâ€™s southwestern border, backing down after a monthlong standoff failed to force Democrats to give him billions of dollars for his long-promised wall.
 The presidentâ€™s concession paved the way for the House and the Senate to both pass a stopgap spending bill by voice vote. Mr. Trump signed it on Friday night, restoring normal operations at a series of federal agencies until Feb. 15 and opening the way to paying the 800,000 federal workers who have been furloughed or forced to work without pay for 35 days.
 The plan includes none of the money for the wall that Mr. Trump had demanded and was essentially the same approach that he rejected at the end of December and that Democrats have advocated since, meaning he won nothing concrete during the impasse.
 Mr. Trump presented the agreement with congressional leaders as a victory anyway, and indicated in a speech in the Rose Garden that his cease-fire may only be temporary: If Republicans and Democrats cannot reach agreement on wall money by the February deadline, he said that he was ready to renew the confrontation or declare a national emergency to bypass Congress altogether.
 â€œWe really have no choice but to build a powerful wall or steel barrier,â€\\x9d Mr. Trump said. â€œIf we donâ€™t get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down on Feb. 15, or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and Constitution of the United States to address this emergency.â€\\x9d
 But Mr. Trump has already adopted some of the language that his Democratic adversaries have used during the longest shutdown in history. He conceded that â€œwe do not need 2,000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shining sea â€” we never didâ€\\x9d and invoked the utility of â€œsmart wallsâ€\\x9d that substitute some physical barriers for drones and other sensors. The semantic evolution provides both the president and Democrats with a face-saving way forward if they want it.
 The surprise announcement was a remarkable surrender for a president who made the wall his nonnegotiable condition for reopening the government and a centerpiece of his political platform. Some immigration hard-liners that make up a key part of his political base were incensed by the capitulation.
 â€œGood news for George Herbert Walker Bush: As of today, he is no longer the biggest wimp ever to serve as President of the United States,â€\\x9d the commentator Ann Coulter, who has aggressively pushed Mr. Trump to keep his campaign promise on the wall, wrote on Twitter.
 On Capitol Hill, though, jittery lawmakers from both parties greeted the news with relief. Mr. Trump relented as the effects of the shutdown were rippling with ever greater force across the economy, with fallout far beyond paychecks. On Friday, air traffic controllers calling in sick slowed air traffic across the Northeast; hundreds of workers at the Internal Revenue Service also did not show up; and the F.B.I. director said he was as angry as he had ever been over his agents not being paid.
 â€œNone of us are willing to go through this again,â€\\x9d said Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, referring to a half-dozen Republicans who voted on Thursday for a Democratic measure to reopen the government for two weeks. â€œAnd itâ€™s not just a few of us. There are a great many in our conference that feel pretty strongly.â€\\x9d
 Democrats, who declined to revel in their clear victory, said they would work in good faith to strike a deal on border security. They have raised their offer on border security funding considerably and toughened their rhetoric on stopping illegal immigration.
 But Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated plainly that any compromise would not include money for a new border wall, which Democrats view as ineffective and overly costly even though many have supported border fencing in the past.
 â€œHave I not been clear on a wall?â€\\x9d Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. The two have repeatedly said they would support allocating additional money for technology and increased patrols along the border, like the ones Mr. Trump referenced on Friday.
 The cease-fire should pave the way for Mr. Trump to deliver his State of the Union address to Congress after all, but Ms. Pelosi said it would not be held this Tuesday, as originally scheduled. She had rescinded her invitation this week to come to the House chamber until the government was reopened, and on Friday, she said she would work with Mr. Trump to find a new date.
 â€œThe State of the Union is not planned now,â€\\x9d Ms. Pelosi said. â€œWhen government is open we will discuss a mutually agreeable date.â€\\x9d
 As he announced the deal, Mr. Trump paid tribute to the federal workers who have endured five weeks without pay, expressing sympathy for them in a way he had not until now. â€œYou are fantastic people,â€\\x9d he said.
 He promised to ensure that workers would be compensated for the paychecks they have missed since the shutdown began in late December â€œvery quickly or as soon as possible.â€\\x9d To that effect, the Office of Management and Budget circulated a letter to affected agencies and departments on Friday afternoon instructing management to prepare for an â€œorderly reopeningâ€\\x9d and to prioritize pay and benefits for workers.
 But other costs will be more permanent. Many federal contractors do not expect to be repaid for their work during the shutdown. Its compounding effects will ultimately cost the federal government more money than if it was open. And though the long-term economic damage caused by the shutdown remains to be seen, it appears that at the very least the short-term pain was more costly than a down payment on the border wall.
 According to an analysis from Standard & Poorâ€™s, the ratings agency, the United States economy lost at least $6 billion in the five weeks the government was partly shuttered â€” more than the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump had requested to build a steel or concrete barrier at the border.
 Mr. Trump offered no explanation for his surrender, nor did he acknowledge that it was one. On Twitter on Friday night, he said: â€œThis was in no way a concession. It was taking care of millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the Shutdown with the understanding that in 21 days, if no deal is done, itâ€™s off to the races!â€\\x9d
 During the presidentâ€™s speech earlier in the day, cabinet officials and White House aides lined the sides of the Rose Garden and applauded him. Mr. Trump began his remarks as if he had actually emerged victorious, saying that he was â€œvery proud to announceâ€\\x9d what he called â€œa deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government.â€\\x9d
 Few lawmakers even in the presidentâ€™s own party saw it that way.
 â€œI hail from a state that is very supportive of the president and border security with barriers, so that is a consideration for me, but there are a lot of other strategies we could employ that would work betterâ€\\x9d than a shutdown, said Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia.
 With polls showing the president enduring most of the blame by the public, Republicans led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, pressured Mr. Trump to agree to the temporary truce. Over the next three weeks, a House-Senate conference committee representing both parties will negotiate a border security plan, but if it fails to reach a consensus, government agencies could close again.
 The presidentâ€™s concession came a day after two competing measures to reopen the government failed on the Senate floor. A Democratic bill, which would have reopened the government with no strings attached, received more votes than the bill backed by Mr. Trump, which included temporary protections for some undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion for his proposed border wall.
 Mr. McConnell and Mr. Schumer huddled on Thursday night after the failed votes to discuss a path forward. Mr. Schumer rejected the idea of offering a down payment for the wall to reopen the government and pitched Mr. McConnell on what ultimately became the agreement with Mr. Trump, according to a senior Democratic aide.
 Mr. McConnell, who viewed the shutdown as unnecessary from the start, found Mr. Trump eager to end the impasse, and in a series of calls, they ironed out the details. To the Republican leader, it was a way to ease much of the pressure on federal workers and get the Senate back to work.
 As late as early Friday morning, Mr. Trump appeared intent on declaring a national emergency at the border alongside the agreement to reopen the government, but Mr. McConnell and White House officials encouraged him to drop the idea, according to people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to discuss them.
 Republican leaders tried to rally their members during a closed policy luncheon before Thursdayâ€™s votes. But even as Republicans prepared to support Mr. Trumpâ€™s plan, the signs of mounting frustration after weeks of inaction were evident.
 Republican senators rose one by one to voice concerns about the effect on federal workers and the lack of forward momentum in an impasse that felt unbearable. They swore they would never stand by another government shutdown.
 â€œWeâ€™ve already lost,â€\\x9d lamented Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, according to people familiar with the remarks. â€œItâ€™s a matter of the extent we want to keep losing.â€\\x9d
 At another point, during an exchange first reported by The Washington Post, Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, vented at Mr. McConnell for putting Republicans in the position of having to vote on two competing approaches to reopen the government â€” one Republican and one Democratic â€” without consulting them first.
 â€œYou put us in this position,â€\\x9d Mr. Johnson said, according to one of his aides.
 Mr. McConnell, who had largely been absent from negotiations to reopen the government until late last week, responded, â€œAre you suggesting Iâ€™m enjoying this?â€\\x9d

TITLE: Ocasio-Cortez defends Tlaib after impeachment remarks: â€˜I got your backâ€™

PUBLISHED: 2019/01/05

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took a stand for fellow House freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib on Saturday after the latterâ€™s expletive-laced comments in favor of impeaching President Trump.
 Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic socialist lawmaker from New York, went on Twitter to weigh in, accusing the GOP of a having a double standard.
 â€œRepublican hypocrisy at its finest: saying that Trump admitting to sexual assault on tape is just â€˜locker room talk,â€™ but scandalizing themselves into faux-outrage when my sis says a curse word in a bar,â€\\x9d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.  â€œGOP lost entitlement to policing womenâ€™s behavior a long time ago. Next.â€\\x9d
 The lawmaker was apparently referring to a 2005 video that came to light ahead of the 2016 presidential election, in which Trump â€“ talking to Billy Bush â€“ made lewd comments about women.
 Trump issued an apology at the time and described the contents of the "Access Hollywood" recording as â€œlocker room banter.â€\\x9d  He later released a followup video apology, insisting the remarks didn't "reflect who I am.â€\\x9d
 â€œI said it, I was wrong, and I apologize," Trump said.
 On Saturday, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted a vow to support Tlaib, D-Mich.
 â€œI got your back @RashidaTlaib - the Bronx and Detroit ride together,â€\\x9d she tweeted.
 Tlaib, who was sworn in as a new member of the 116th Congress on Thursday, was videotaped that night vowing to impeach the president -- shortly after she penned an op-ed for The Detroit Free Press outlining the case for impeachment.
 â€œPeople love you and you win,â€\\x9d the video showed Tlaib telling supporters.  â€œAnd when your son looks at you and says: â€˜Momma, look you won. Bullies donâ€™t win.â€™  And I said, â€˜Baby, they donâ€™t, because weâ€™re gonna go in there and weâ€™re gonna impeach the motherf***er.â€™â€\\x9d
 House Republicans fumed over the comments on Friday, with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., prodding Speaker Nancy Pelosi to act.
 Yet Pelosi, D-Calif., downplayed Tlaibâ€™s remarks, expressing distaste for the language but suggesting that Trumpâ€™s own language had started the heated rhetoric in Washington.
 â€œI probably have a generational reaction to it,â€\\x9d Pelosi said at an MSNBC town hall.  â€œBut in any event, Iâ€™m not in the censorship business.  I donâ€™t like that language, I wouldnâ€™t use that language.  I donâ€™tâ€¦.establish any language standards for my colleagues, but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s anything worse than what the president has said.â€\\x9d
 In the Rose Garden on Friday, Trump said he found Tlaibâ€™s comments â€œdisgracefulâ€\\x9d and thought she â€œdishonored herselfâ€\\x9d as well as â€œher family.â€\\x9d
 Tlaib, doubling down on her comments, tweeted on Friday that she â€œwill always speak truth to power. #unapologeticallyMe.â€\\x9d
 â€œThis is not just about Donald Trump. This is about all of us. In the face of this constitutional crisis, we must rise,â€\\x9d she tweeted.

TITLE: Trump declares emergency on border, eyes $8B for wall as he signs spending package

PUBLISHED: 2019/02/15

President Trump said Friday he is declaring a national emergency on the southern border, tapping into executive powers in a bid to divert billions toward construction of a wall even as he signs a funding package that includes just $1.4 billion for border security.
 â€œWeâ€™re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border â€¦ one way or the other, we have to do it,â€\\x9d Trump said in the Rose Garden.
 The move is expected to face a swift and forceful legal challenge that could stall the attempt in the courts for the near future. But the declaration and other money-moving plans allow Trump to continue to fight for border wall construction while also averting another partial government shutdown -- which would have been triggered at midnight absent the new funding package. He signed the spending deal Friday afternoon.
 Trump, in the Rose Garden, declared once again that "walls work" as he confirmed the emergency declaration would accompany the spending legislation.
 "Weâ€™re talking about an invasion of our country," Trump said.
 And in an almost-casual tone, the president predicted a legal fight that will wind up before the Supreme Court.
 "We will have a national emergency, and we will then be sued," Trump said, adding that the federal appeals courts could well rule against his administration. "Then weâ€™ll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully weâ€™ll get a fair shake, and weâ€™ll win at the Supreme Court -- just like the [travel] ban.â€\\x9d
 A senior administration official told Fox News that the White House plans to move $8 billion in currently appropriated or available funds toward construction of the wall. Of that, $3 billion could be diverted with help from the emergency declaration.
 That money includes about $600 million from the Treasury Departmentâ€™s forfeiture fund. That money has been described as â€œeasy moneyâ€\\x9d that the White House can use however it wants. The White House is also expected to use drug interdiction money from the Department of Defense.
 But by declaring an emergency, Trump would also seek to unlock money from the Defense Departmentâ€™s military construction budget, to the tune of $3.5 billion.
 Diverting Pentagon funding, however, is expected to set off a legal battle and has already prompted fierce opposition from Democrats in Congress.
 "This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed President, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. "The President's actions clearly violate the Congressâ€™s exclusive power of the purse, which our Founders enshrined in the Constitution."
 They vowed Congress would "defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the Courts, and in the public, using every remedy available."
 "The Presidentâ€™s declaration of a national emergency would be an abuse of his constitutional oath and an affront to the separation of powers. Congress has the exclusive power of the purse, and the Constitution specifically prohibits the President from spending money that has not been appropriated. ... This is a gross abuse of power that cannot be tolerated," House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a statement.
 This is far from the only declared national emergency. According to the Congressional Research Service, there are at least 30 "national emergencies" in effect, including those concerning blocking Iranian government property, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other terror-related acts. But none of the emergencies have involved the president of the United States spending money that had not been specifically appropriated by Congress.
 The presidentâ€™s decision to declare a national emergency comes after a review of the spending package. The compromise package, which was negotiated for weeks in a bipartisan conference committee, passed both the House and the Senate on Thursday. But the deal would provide only a fraction of Trumpâ€™s originally proposed figure of $5.7 billion for border security and construction of a wall or physical barrier along the southern border.
 The bill also imposed a number of restrictions on the White House, with legislative language preventing the administration from moving funding around to get a barrier or a wall -- a factor that may have contributed to the emergency declaration decision.
 The package, as it stands, is enough to build just 55 miles of barrier. And notably, the word "wall" does not appear once in the 1,768 pages of legislation and explanatory materials.
 The funding battle follows the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. From Dec. 22 through Jan. 25â€”for 35 daysâ€”the White House and congressional Democrats battled over border security funding. Trump requested $5.7 billion for construction of the wall, while Democrats vowed to block any spending proposal that included such funding. The shutdown left more than 800,000 federal employees and contractors furloughed or working without pay. At the end of last month, though, Trump signed a short-term spending package that funded the government through the Friday deadline.
 The prior fight left little appetite on either side of the aisle for another shutdown, leading to the passage Thursday of the compromise measure.
 Trump, though, has talked for weeks about taking executive action to divert money from other programs for wall construction, without congressional sign-offâ€”despite his criticisms of former President Barack Obama for using executive action.

TITLE: House Intelligence Committee Republicans Demand Chairman Adam Schiff's Resignation

PUBLISHED: 2019/03/28

All nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee are calling on Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) to resign as its chairman over his public comments about the Russia investigation, which did not determine that President Donald Trump or anyone on his campaign conspired with Russia to win the 2016 election.
 Schiff has maintained his strong belief that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, after the nearly two-year probe came to an end last week without directly implicating the president.
 â€œUndoubtedly there is collusion,â€\\x9d Schiff told The Washington Post on Tuesday. â€œWe will continue to investigate the counterintelligence issues. That is, is the president or people around him compromised in any way by a hostile foreign power? ... It doesnâ€™t appear that was any part of [special counsel Robert] Muellerâ€™s report.â€\\x9d
 In a letter dated Thursday, the GOP committee members accused Schiff of standing â€œat the center of a well-orchestrated media campaignâ€\\x9d about a possible Trump-Russia connection. The group even went so far as to link Schiff to leaked information about the investigation.
 â€œYour willingness to continue to promote a demonstrably false narrative is alarming,â€\\x9d they said, joining other top Republican lawmakers demanding Schiffâ€™s ouster.
 Trump himself called on Schiff to resign Thursday in an early-morning tweet that accused the chairman of â€œunlawfully lying and leakingâ€\\x9d information. The president said Schiff should be â€œforcedâ€\\x9d to step down from Congress entirely.
 Somewhat misleadingly, the GOP committee members stated in their letter that Muellerâ€™s findings â€œconclusively refuteâ€\\x9d Schiffâ€™s â€œpast and present assertionsâ€\\x9d about the investigation. While Mueller says his report â€œdoes not conclude that the President committed a crime,â€\\x9d it â€œalso does not exonerate him.â€\\x9d
 Questions about what the full report uncovered are still at the forefront of many Democratsâ€™ minds, and the party is uniformly calling for the Justice Department to release it publicly.
 The Intelligence Committee Republicansâ€™ letter concluded, â€œYour actions both past and present are incompatible with your duty as Chairman of this Committee, which alone in the House of Representatives has the obligation and authority to provide effective oversight of the U.S. intelligence community.â€\\x9d
 Schiff, in response to his critics, doubled down on his questions about the special counselâ€™s investigation, which indicted more than 30 people â€• including several close to Trump.
 â€œI donâ€™t think itâ€™s OK,â€\\x9d he said Thursday. â€œI think itâ€™s immoral. I think itâ€™s unethical. I think itâ€™s unpatriotic, and yes, I think itâ€™s corrupt and evidence of collusion.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Trump's 'Compromise' Immigration Offer To Democrats Includes Major Changes Restricting Asylum Law

PUBLISHED: 2019/01/22

WASHINGTON â€• President Donald Trumpâ€™s offer to Democrats over the weekend seeking to trade temporary protections for some immigrants in exchange for funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border received positive coverage from some outlets, including being called a â€œcompromiseâ€\\x9d and a move by Trump â€œtoward the center.â€\\x9d
 But the latest details in the proposal, which Senate Republicans unveiled Monday in a bill they plan to vote on this week, make the offer appear less of a compromise and more of a wish list for immigration hard-liners like White House adviser Stephen Miller.
 Trump is offering a three-year extension for the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects from deportation hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the U.S. as kids. The offer would also give a three-year extension to 300,000 people from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Honduras who are living in the U.S. under the temporary protected status program.
 Democrats rejected the offer before Trump even announced it on Saturday, however, maintaining that it didnâ€™t go nearly far enough and that the president ought to reopen the government before any negotiations over the border proceed.
 But the GOP bill incorporating his offer would also gut existing asylum laws for children and trafficking victims from Central America, ban asylum for minors who present themselves at ports of entry, gut the concept of temporary protected status for future cases and expand immigration detention â€• all measures making it more likely to be dead on arrival in the Senate.
 â€œGiven the poison pills stuffed into a proposal that was supposed to entice Democrats we can now say the Trump â€˜offerâ€™ isnâ€™t about getting to a deal but about shifting blame. So obvious. So predictable. So pathetic,â€\\x9d Frank Sharry, the executive director of the immigration advocacy group Americaâ€™s Voice, tweeted on Tuesday.
 The bill would ban asylum for Central American minors, including those who arrive at the border with their parents, unless the minors apply for asylum in their home country. It would also cap the number of Central American minors who are allowed to apply for asylum each year at 50,000 and limit the number of asylum applications that could be granted per year to 15,000.
 The administration has for months tried to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in the U.S. as part of a broader effort to stem the flow of Central American migrants crossing the border from Mexico. Trumpâ€™s administrative attempts to curtail the asylum process have faced legal challenges in two federal courts, however, prompting this weekâ€™s legislative fix.
 â€œThis bill includes the most extreme changes on asylum that Iâ€™ve ever seen,â€\\x9d Kerri Talbot, the director of federal advocacy at the group Immigration Hub, said on a press call on Tuesday.
 Under the GOP bill, minors who apply for asylum would face much stiffer consequences for filing an application found to be frivolous â€• including permanent ineligibility for future protections.
 The billâ€™s changes to asylum law alarmed immigration activists online, as well some on the right, including attorney and conservative writer Gabriel Malor.
 Trumpâ€™s efforts to win over Democratic support on the bill â€• which will require at least 60 votes to pass in the Senate â€• hit even more trouble on Tuesday after the Supreme Court once again did not act on the administrationâ€™s effort to end DACA. The move essentially left protections for Dreamers in place for at least the next several months â€• giving Democrats less incentive to agree to Trumpâ€™s offer of protections to DACA recipients.

TITLE: Rashida Tlaib's Expletive-Laden Cry to Impeach Trump Upends Democrats' Talking Points

PUBLISHED: 2019/01/04

WASHINGTON â€” Impeachment was always going to hang heavily over a divided Washington. But it took little more than 24 hours this week for a freshman House Democratâ€™s exuberant, expletive-laden impeachment promise to upend the bonhomie of a new Congress and prompt President Trump, by his own telling, to ask the newly elected speaker if Democrats planned to impeach him.
 The episode began Thursday night, just hours after the 116th Congress was sworn in, when a camera captured Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan promising profanely to impeach Mr. Trump as she drew cheers from liberal activists at a celebration at a bar near the Capitol. By the time Mr. Trump discussed the matter directly in a news conference in the Rose Garden on Friday afternoon, weeks of speculation about his potential peril had burst into the open.
 Republicans, eager to portray Democrats as out to destroy Mr. Trumpâ€™s presidency, piled on criticism of Ms. Tlaib â€” some of it racially tinged. (Ms. Tlaib, who is Palestinian-American, is one of the first Muslims in Congress. The Christian Broadcasting Network referred to her as a â€œfoul-mouthed Islamic congresswoman.â€\\x9d) Democratic leaders, who view discussion of impeachment as politically dangerous and premature, offered worried words meant to tamp down speculation about their intentions.
 Perhaps out of a belief that an impeachment fight would help him politically â€” as it did President Bill Clinton in the 1990s â€” or outright fear that newly empowered Democrats actually might threaten his presidency, Mr. Trump dived into the conversation head first.
 â€œWe even talked about that today,â€\\x9d he told reporters in the Rose Garden, referring to an exchange with Speaker Nancy Pelosi during a meeting earlier Friday to try to negotiate an end to the shutdown of the government, which Mr. Trump threatened to keep closed for years if he did not get money from Congress for a wall on the southern border. â€œI said, Why donâ€™t you use this for impeachment? And Nancy said, Weâ€™re not looking to impeach you.â€\\x9d
 Senior aides to Ms. Pelosi and other Democrats in the room disputed that characterization. The president had indeed invoked Ms. Tlaib and other House Democrats who want to impeach him, they said, but Ms. Pelosi tried to shift the meeting back to its intended topic and did not offer the president reassurances.
 â€œIn his opening comments at the meeting, President Trump brought up impeachment,â€\\x9d Ms. Pelosiâ€™s spokesman, Drew Hammill, wrote on Twitter. â€œSpeaker Pelosi made clear that todayâ€™s meeting was about re-opening government, not impeachment.â€\\x9d
 Regardless, Mr. Trumpâ€™s frank embrace of the issue was another astonishing development: a president of the United States talking openly about his potential impeachment at a White House news conference.
 Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump had asked on Twitter, â€œHow do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time? â€\\x9d He continued the theme at his news conference by asserting that â€œyou canâ€™t impeach somebody who is doing a great job.â€\\x9d
 Ms. Pelosi and senior Democrats said they were determined not to take the bait for now and risk generating a backlash from Mr. Trumpâ€™s supporters, who would most likely see impeachment as the overreaction of out-of-control Democrats. But the words of Ms. Tlaib, who stood by her comments on Friday, made evident the pressure already mounting from the left, where public opinion polls suggest a majority of liberals want the president removed from office.
 â€œPeople love you and you win,â€\\x9d Ms. Tlaib told the crowd Thursday night. â€œAnd when your son looks at you and says: â€™Momma, look, you won. Bullies donâ€™t win.â€™ And I said, â€™Baby, they donâ€™t.â€™ Because weâ€™re going to go in there, and weâ€™re going to impeach the motherfucker.â€\\x9d
 She made no apologies for the remark on Friday, proclaiming that â€œI will always speak truth to powerâ€\\x9d and fashioning her own hashtag, #unapologeticallyme. She told a Detroit television station that â€œitâ€™s probably exactly how my grandmother, if she was alive, would say it.â€\\x9d
 Her outburst ran counter to all Democratic talking points. Ms. Pelosi and her deputies have repeatedly made the case that it is too early to consider impeachment. Even as Mr. Trumpâ€™s legal perils have deepened â€” and federal prosecutors in New York appear to have gathered evidence implicating him in a campaign finance crime â€” Democrats have said they want to wait to see the findings of an investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, of the president, his campaign and Russiaâ€™s attempts to interfere in the 2016 election.
 â€œI donâ€™t really like that kind of language,â€\\x9d Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee â€” where any impeachment inquiry must begin â€” said on CNN. â€œBut more to the point, I disagree with what she said. It is too early to talk about that intelligently. We have to follow the facts.â€\\x9d
 Ms. Pelosi defended Ms. Tlaib on Friday at a town hall hosted by MSNBC at the speakerâ€™s alma mater in Washington, Trinity University. â€œIâ€™m not in the censorship business,â€\\x9d Ms. Pelosi said.
 The Constitution grants the House the power to impeach executive branch officials for â€œtreason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors,â€\\x9d but what constitutes such crimes has traditionally been defined by the majority party of the House. A vote to impeach takes a simple majority in the House, but a two-thirds vote is needed in the Senate to convict and remove an official from office.
 Mr. Nadler, Ms. Pelosi and other party elders believe Mr. Trump is threatening the countryâ€™s democratic institutions. Privately, many harbor suspicions that he obstructed justice, collaborated with the Russians in 2016 or both. But they also argue that an impeachment that does not have a reasonable shot of winning a conviction in the Senate will backfire and strengthen Mr. Trump in the 2020 campaign. In the meantime, they are planning to open multiple investigations into accusations of wrongdoing around the president, his campaign and his administration.
 â€œWe shouldnâ€™t be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldnâ€™t avoid impeachment for a political reason,â€\\x9d Ms. Pelosi said. â€œSo weâ€™ll just have to see how it comes.â€\\x9d
 Republicans ignored the distinction.
 â€œIs this the behavior that we are going to find with this new majority party in Congress?â€\\x9d Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, asked at a news conference. He repeatedly singled out Ms. Pelosi, asking why she had not censured Ms. Tlaib.
 Mr. Trump was similarly critical of Ms. Tlaib.
 â€œI thought her comments were disgraceful,â€\\x9d Mr. Trump said at the news conference. â€œI think she dishonored herself, and I think she dishonored her family.â€\\x9d He added that her comments were â€œdisrespectful to the United States of America.â€\\x9d
 Ms. Tlaib is far from alone among House Democrats. Representatives Brad Sherman of California and Al Green of Texas formally introduced an article of impeachment on Thursday, charging that Mr. Trump had obstructed justice in firing James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director. Others are expected to follow.
 â€œI continue to believe that obstruction of justice is the clearest, simplest and most provable high crime and misdemeanor committed by Donald J. Trump,â€\\x9d Mr. Sherman said in a statement. â€œI hope that the articles of impeachment are the subject of hearings before the Judiciary Committee early in 2019.â€\\x9d
 Many of Ms. Tlaibâ€™s new colleagues expressed sympathy for her sentiments, even as they said the House should proceed differently.
 â€œDonald Trump is going to be impeached whether it is by the ballot box or Congress,â€\\x9d said Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California and a member of the Intelligence Committee. â€œIt will just be a matter of which one comes first.â€\\x9d
 But, Mr. Swalwell added, Democrats need to avoid making â€œa martyrâ€\\x9d out of Mr. Trump by affording him â€œa fairer investigation than he deserves.â€\\x9d

TITLE: Democrats Demand Immediate Release Of Mueller Report

PUBLISHED: 2019/03/22

Democrats want access to special counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election before President Donald Trump has a chance to interfere.
 In a joint letter from the chairs of six committees in the U.S. House of Representatives, Democrats wrote they expect Attorney General William Barr to make Muellerâ€™s report public immediately.
 â€œAfter nearly two years of investigation â€” accompanied by two years of unprecedented attacks on the integrity of the investigation by President Trump â€” the public and Congress are entitled to know what the Special Counsel has found,â€\\x9d the letter urged.
 Its signatories include House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), oversight committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.)
 Earlier, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) released a statement immediately after the Mueller report was revealed to be complete, demanding that Barr quickly put together a redacted, releasable version for Congress to access.
 Warner said in a statement: â€œCongress and the American people deserve to judge the facts for themselves. The Special Counselâ€™s report must be provided to Congress immediately, and the Attorney General should swiftly prepare a declassified version of the report for the public. Nothing short of that will suffice.
 It is also critical that all documents related to the Special Counselâ€™s investigation be preserved and made available to the appropriate Congressional committees. Any attempt by the Trump Administration to cover up the results of this investigation into Russiaâ€™s attack on our democracy would be unacceptable.â€\\x9d
 He joined a number of other Democrats, including several 2020 presidential candidates, who either had statements prepared or tweeted about a prompt release.
 â€œThe American people deserve to know the full truth about Russiaâ€™s interference in our democracy,â€\\x9d tweeted former Housing and Urban Development Secretary JuliÃ¡n Castro.
 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said that the report should be released â€œwithout delay,â€\\x9d and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) released a joint statement in agreement.
 They, like Warner, didnâ€™t want Trump to throw a wrench in Congressâ€™ spokes by getting early access to the documents.
 â€œAttorney General Barr must not give President Trump, his lawyers or his staff any â€˜sneak previewâ€™ of Special Counsel Muellerâ€™s findings or evidence, and the White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public,â€\\x9d the joint statement said.
 Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, echoed Trumpâ€™s own earlier call to release the report.
 Meanwhile, CNN reports that the â€œprincipal conclusionâ€\\x9d of the report, which the attorney general will soon give to Congress, is expected to be made public.
 Trumpâ€™s camp wasnâ€™t champing at the bit.
 â€œWeâ€™re pleased that the Office of Special Counsel has delivered its report to the Attorney General pursuant to the regulations. Attorney General Barr will determine the appropriate next steps,â€\\x9d said the presidentâ€™s personal attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow in a joint statement.

However, GAStech has not been as successful in demonstrating environmental stewardship. In January, 2014, the leaders of GAStech are celebrating their new-found fortune as a result of the initial public offering of their very successful company. In the midst of this celebration, several employees of GAStech go missing. An organization known as the Protectors of Kronos (POK) is suspected in the disappearances. It is January 21, 2014, and as an expert in visual analytics, you have been tasked with helping people understand the complex relationships among people and organizations that may have contributed to these events.

While prior work in NLP has primarily focused on the lexical bias captured by linguistic attributes such as word choice and syntax, other types of bias stem from the actual content selected for inclusion in the text. This dataset investigates the effects of informational bias: factual content that can nevertheless be deployed to sway reader opinion.
